0,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive, natural health care system that originated in the  ancient Vedic times of India. Epigenetics refers to the external modification of  DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without  changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have  transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are  lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors.  Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti  (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and  indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus,  it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This  correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and  understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of  both sciences in the management of optimal health. In addition, research on  Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will further increase correlation  and understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda.",Can Ayurvedic practices influence our genes and improve overall health?,Can changing my lifestyle or diet with Ayurveda methods affect my genes and improve my overall health?,Can Ayurveda practices like changing my diet or reducing stress help improve my health by influencing my genes?
1,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with  complex multi-organ-multi-target crosstalk in the body. Currently, the  theoretical assumptions framing the diabetes management strategies are  reductionist and largely focus on reducing hyperglycemia through targeted  molecular drugs. While they effectively reduce hyperglycemia, they are  inadequate to address the multifactorial etiopathology, chronicity and systemic  complications of diabetes. Therefore, a holistic and systemic approach is  essential for its successful management. We hypothesize an integrative diabetes  management strategy, combining holistic principles of diabetes management with  its molecular understandings, would be more appropriate to fill this gap. The  holistic disease management principles of Ayurveda, the Indian system of  medicine, can play a pivotal role in this context. This narrative review  discusses the scope of a trans-disciplinary ' Ayurveda-Biology ' approach for  deepening the holistic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes as well  as designing novel integrative strategies for managing diabetes and restoring  whole body glucose homeostasis. METHODOLOGY: The article analyses the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management and  correlates it with the molecular understanding of its pathophysiology and  management. The sources of information used in this article include classical  texts of Ayurveda , medical books, published research articles and scientific  databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science-Direct, etc. RESULTS: While  Ayurveda and modern biomedicine uses different epistemology and ontology for  describing diabetes, both the systems recognize the central role of gut and gut  derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose  homeostasis. Essentially, the principles of both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine  overlap at a gut centred view of diabetes management; and Gastro-intestinal  mediated glucose disposal , a holistic concept of glucose metabolism, is  emerging as a converging node for designing innovative integrative diabetes  management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: An integrative disease management strategy, combining holistic and  reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively,  would be the prerogative for successful management of diabetes. Creating an '  Ayurveda-Biology' knowledge framework integrating the patient centred holistic  management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology  can give better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and  offer novel strategies for cost effective, holistic and multi-targeted  management of diabetes.",How can integrating Ayurveda principles with modern biology help in managing diabetes?,"I've heard that diabetes is more than just having high blood sugar levels.

2,"Epilepsy, a chronic non-communicable disease of the brain, is one of the most  common neurological diseases globally that affects people of all ages. The  existence of medical, neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive comorbidities has  always undermined the available advanced treatment strategies for epilepsy.  New-generation antiepileptic drugs being less successful in completely  controlling the seizures and observance of complex diseases, including  drug-resistant cases, have provided scope for integrating and incorporating the  therapeutic modalities of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian art of holistic medicine,  in the effective management of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara,  described in the classics of Ayurveda as the transient appearance of  unconsciousness with loathsome expression due to derangement of memory,  intelligence, and mind. The multifaceted therapeutic approach of Ayurveda, which  involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying  procedures, herbal and herbo-mineral formulations, disease, and host-specific  approaches, have enhanced the potential of not only relieving symptoms but also  modifying the pathophysiology of the disease. Newer paradigms of research in  Ayurveda, along with holistic and integrative approaches with contemporary  medicine, can not only benefit the existing healthcare system but also impact  future healthcare management in epileptology research. This cursory literature  review is an earnest attempt to identify, evaluate, and summarize various  studies and provide a comprehensive insight into the potential of Ayurveda in  understanding and treating epilepsy.",How can Ayurveda be used in managing and treating epilepsy?,I've heard that Ayurveda might help with managing epilepsy.

7,"Ayurveda is a traditional system of healthcare that is native to India and has a  rich documented literature of its own. Most of the historians agree that the  documentation of core Ayurveda literature took place approximately in between  400 BCE and 200 CE, while acknowledging that the roots of its theoretical  framework can be traced back to a much earlier period. For multiple reasons many  significant contributions of Ayurveda literature to various streams of  biological and medical sciences have remained under-recognized while recounting  the historical milestones of development. This is true in the context of the  physiology of digestion and metabolism too. In this communication we try to  reconstruct a picture of the processes of digestion and metabolism as had been  understood by ancient Ayurveda scholars. Though this understanding was primitive  and insufficient in many ways, we argue that this deserves to be documented and  acknowledged. To help with grasping the importance of these contributions, we  juxtapose them with the corresponding insights pertaining to this subject  reported by prominent western scientists. The major contributions of Ayurveda  that have been recounted in this paper are those related to the description of  three distinct phases of digestion (Avasthapaka), multiple sets of  transformative entities acting at different levels of metabolism (Agni), and the  roles ascribed to various internal and external factors in executing these  physiological functions.",What are the key contributions of Ayurveda to our understanding of digestion and metabolism?,I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately.

8,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, included geriatrics as 1 of 8  medical divisions. Well-documented evidence exists for treating aging and  age-related disorders including dementia. Geriatrics was termed Rasayanatantra.  Cognitive function was well recognized and Sanskrit terms existed such as Buddhi  for intelligence and Cittanasa (Citta means mind, nasa means loss of) for  dementia. A normal human life span was considered to be 100 years. It could be  prolonged to 116-120 years through the use of preventive treatments, if they  were started during late youth or middle age. Treatments included herbal  preparations, diet, exercise, and attention to general mode of life and social  behavior.

9,"BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva. Although data  on clinical efficacy and safety of various ayurvedic treatments in  conjunctivitis is published, systematic review is not done. This systematic  review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ayurvedic  treatments in conjunctivitis. METHODS: A literature search of the Cochrane Library (Cochrane central register  of controlled trials: issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Pub Med, AYUSH research portal  (Govt. of India), DHARA portal, Google scholar and online clinical trials  registers was done. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized  controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and multiple arms  clinical trials were identified in which Ayurveda treatments with any dose,  type, schedule, drug, dosage form, and advised Pathayapathya (lifestyle changes)  were selected. RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, five CCTs and two multiple arms  clinical trials which includes a total of 816 participants. Meta analysis of  data from five trials showed that ayurvedic treatments benefitted more compared  with non-ayurveda interventions in symptoms like itching (SMD = -0.98, 95% CI  (-1.30,-0.65) p < 0.00001, I2 = 38%), pain (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI (-0.87, -0.29,  P = 0.0001, I2 = 0%), ropy discharge (SMD = -1.02, 95% CI(-1.45, -0.59),  P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), conjunctival congestion (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-0.91,  -0.43), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), foreign body sensation (SMD = -0.68, 95%  CI(-1.06, -0.29), p = 0.0006, I2 = 46%, Fig. 8) and lid heaviness (SMD = -0.66,  95% CI(- 0.98, -0.33), p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Although some findings confirm the benefit of ayurveda as opposed  to non ayurveda for the treatment of conjunctivitis, since the studies have high  risk of bias and are of lower quality, the findings could not be generalized.  There is a need for high quality studies in ayurveda in this regard.

Several aspects of administrative  management, education, teaching and related aspects for promotion and  development of Ayurveda and other Indian systems of traditional medicine have  been discussed. RESULTS: This paper reviews on different aspects of development of Ayurveda.  Presently, there are 2420 hospitals with about 42271 beds, 15017 dispensaries,  429246 registered practitioners, more than 320 educational institutions, 7699  drug-manufacturing units to promote Ayurveda into the health care delivery  system in the country. Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India is the official document  for single Ayurvedic drugs (540 monographs) and different formulations (152  monographs). Several aspects in this regard for development of Ayurveda have  been discussed. CONCLUSION: Considering the widespread use and popularity of Ayurveda worldwide,  administrative management and infrastructure facilities, indigenous practices  and standards for quality control and it's evaluation have been highlighted. In  India, all such efforts for integration of Ayurveda provide potential role in  the health care benefits.",What steps has the Indian government taken to promote the practice of Ayurveda?,"So, Ayurveda is like an ancient health care system, right? I'm curious, are there any natural remedies or lifestyle changes it recommends for dealing with stress or anxiety?",Can you tell me more about Ayurveda and how it can be used to improve my overall health naturally?
20,"Neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease,  Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, depression and anxiety pose a  sizable global health problem, accompanying substantial burden of disorders,  suicides, physical comorbidities, high fiscal expenses, and poor quality of  life. There is a recent upsurge in global interest toward the area of  traditional therapies and phytomedicines are widely admired by researchers owing  to their natural source and fewer side effects. On the contrary, conventional  synthetic drugs have been reported with undesirable but inevitable ill effects  having poor patient compliance. Thus, herbal medicines are being preferred over  synthetic drug therapies as an effective remedy for many brain disorders.  Ayurveda provides a holistic approach to treatment along with several nootropic  herbs having multi-dimensional bioactivities in various disorders. Scattered  information is available pertaining to traditional Ayurvedic remedial options  for various mental disorders. Present review encompasses: (i) common brain  disorders and the associated changes (ii) Ayurvedic holistic approach to manage  neurodegenerative and depressive disorders, and (iii) important Ayurvedic single  herbs and polyherbal formulations with description of their traditional usage  and administration. Concomitantly, it opens up for future investigations and  standardization on Ayurvedic nootropic herbs.",What are some Ayurvedic remedies for managing brain disorders like Alzheimer's and depression?,I've been feeling really anxious and down lately. Are there any natural remedies or herbal treatments that might help me feel better?,"I've been feeling a bit forgetful lately, are there any natural remedies or herbs from Ayurveda that could help with my memory?"
21,"Because the disharmony of mental doshas (satogun, rajogun, and tamogun) and body  doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha) are the major cause of illness, the goal of  illness management in Ayurveda is to bring back harmony among the doshas. The  management includes clinical examination, diagnosis, and dietary and lifestyle  interventions and treatment. The clinical examination consists of Astha Sthana  Pariksha (8-point diagnosis: pulse-diagnosis, urine, stool, tongue, voice and  body sound, eye, skin, and total body appearance examinations) and examination  of the digestive system and the patient's physical strength. The treatment  consists of cleansing (Panchkarma), palliation (improve digestion, remove toxic  waste, fasting, observe thirst, exercise, sunbathing, and meditation), mental  nurturing, and spiritual healing depending on the disturbed doshas and the  patient's constitution. The preferred use of bhasms and herbal formulas over the  respective metallic salts or the single herbs is discussed. This review suggests  a great potential for integration of Ayurvedic therapies into the healthcare  system in the United States.",What is the role of lifestyle changes and diet in managing illness according to Ayurveda?,"I've been feeling off balance lately, both physically and mentally. Could it have something to do with my lifestyle or diet?",Can you explain how Ayurveda might help me improve my overall health as I get older?
22,"The ancient medicine of India (ayurveda) is a broadly conceptualized  anthropology embracing the whole human being without the Western body/soul  dualism. A symptomatology based on careful observation leads, in conjunction  with etiology, pathogenesis and pathology, with constitutional and personality  features, to a differentiated nosology. This broad concept is matched by  multidimensional therapy embracing pharmacologic, surgical, psychotherapeutic  and ""paramedical"" measures. Ayurveda (""life knowledge"") is a combination of  religious, philosophical, anthropological, medical and psychological concepts.  It is impressive how accurate the knowledge and description of psychiatric  diseases already was 2,500 years ago, and how little these phenomena have  changed with time. The therapeutic armamentarium (paramedical, psychotherapeutic  and pharmacologic) of ayurveda psychiatry has not yet been sufficiently studied  by scientific methods.",What are some Ayurvedic methods for managing psychiatric conditions?,I've been feeling really stressed out lately. Could ayurvedic practices help me manage my stress levels better?,I've been feeling very stressed and anxious lately. Are there any natural solutions in Ayurveda that could help me feel more relaxed and calm?
23,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, commonly known as  Ashwagandha, is an important medicinal plant that has been used in Ayurvedic and  indigenous medicine for more than 3000 years. According to Charaka Samhita,  Susruta Samhita and other ancient texts, Ashwagandha is known as Balya  (increases strength), Brusya (sexual performance enhancer), vajikari  (spermatogenic), Kamarupini (libido-enhancing), Pustida (nourishing). AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review article documented and critically assessed W.  somnifera regarding its ethnopharmacology, traditional use, botanical  description, phytochemicals present, pharmacological activities, clinical  trials, and marketed formulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sources of information used in the study are  traditional Ayurvedic books like Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Astanga  Hridaya etc, government reports, dissertations, books, research articles and  databases like Science-Direct, SciFinder, Web of Science, PubMed, Wiley Online  Library, and ACS Publications on Ashwagandha and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal. RESULTS: Traditional uses of Ashwagandha in Ayurveda are very prominent in  several texts where formulations with various dosage forms have been mentioned  in Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Astanga Hridaya, different nighantus etc.  The drugs were identified based on their composition containing Ashwagandha as  one of the major ingredients and their medicinal uses. Phytochemical studies on  W. somnifera revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as  flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and withanolides. The  phytochemicals showed various pharmacological activities like anti-cancer,  immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-aging,  anti-stress/adaptogenic and anti-diabetic. Various clinical trials show that the  plant extract and its bioactive compounds are used in the prevention and  treatment of many diseases, such as arthritis, impotence, amnesia, anxiety,  cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological data reviewed here revealed that W. somnifera is a  potential source for the treatment of a wide range of diseases especially  anxiety and other CNS disorders. From its ancient use to its modern application  it has been proven to be non-toxic and effective clinically for human health and  wellness. W. somnifera based herbal formulation has been marketed in the form of  supplement, extract, capsule, powder etc. This review will be helpful to  correlate the mechanism of action with the phytochemical profile of this  well-known plant from Ayurveda.",What are some benefits of using Ashwagandha for health and wellness?,I've been feeling super stressed and anxious lately. Could Ashwagandha help me chill out and feel better?,I've been feeling quite anxious lately. Is there a natural supplement I can take to help manage this?
24,"Using key informants and available records, the way in which inhabitants of  purana villages in Nuwarakalaviya, Sri Lanka coped with malaria during the  pre-DDT era is examined. This study found that the Nuwarakalaviya peasants  responded to endemic malaria through a localized herbal tradition, which was to  some extent independent of the scholarly ayurveda system common to the whole of  South Asia. The relevant herbal tradition, consisting of a combination of  antiparasite and antivector strategies using locally available natural  resources, represented an effective adaptation to the local ecosystem.",What are some natural methods used in Sri Lanka to combat malaria?,I get bitten by mosquitos a lot. Are there any natural remedies I can use to protect myself?,What kind of home remedies could I use to naturally protect myself from illnesses like malaria?
25,"OBJECTIVES: Keratosis pilaris (KP) is the condition of the skin with extensive  keratin follicular plugging. It may be associated with the erythema. The upper  arm extensor area, shoulders, back of neck and thighs, as well as face and the  upper trunk are the areas of presentation. Available medications for KP give  only symptomatic relief, while some produce serious side effects. There is no  proven universal treatment for the disease that can provide complete recovery.  Āyuṛveda management of KP is not yet reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old male patient, presented with main complaints  started with papular lesions over his right shoulder, chest and upper back along  and later with pustular lesions in the past 2 weeks. The condition was  associated with redness, mild swelling and itching. The case was diagnosed as  Keratosis pilaris based on its presentation, site, and pathogenesis. Also by  analyzing the extent of vitiation of doṣas (morbidities), the Vata kapha pitta  hara line of treatment was adopted, which was accomplished in two phases i. e.  Śodhana Cikitsa and Śamana Cikitsa. CONCLUSION: Both internal and external treatments along with diet restrictions  were found effective in arresting the pathogenesis and recovery in a short  period. All the symptoms associated with the condition were completely cured  with no signs of re-occurrence.",What are some Ayurvedic treatments for Keratosis pilaris?,I've got these annoying little bumps on my arms and thighs that won't go away.

26,"Food allergy being a common health problem needs attention. The experience of  Ayurveda can be utilized to accelerate our understanding and management of food  allergies and related phenomenon like allergic tension fatigue syndrome,  intolerance and indigestion associated with certain foods. Prevention of food  allergies by carefully selecting the foods in accordance with the individual's  body constitution and seasonal alterations, is considered as the best strategy  in Ayurveda. If possible, the concept of prakriti and properties of food as  described in Ayurveda, should be interpreted in modern terminology. Moreover, to  scientifically validate them, an appropriate correlation with modern concepts is  required along with scientific studies on modern parameters. Rasayanas may also  prove helpful in the management of food allergies. It is obvious that there, is  an urgent need for multidimensional and planned investigations of these  Ayurvedic rasayanas in management of food allergies. The clinical acceptability  of rasayanas for the treatment of food allergies entirely rests on such studies.  Food intolerance and allergies are common health problems which are difficult to  diagnose and still more difficult to treat. This problem is well addressed in  Ayurveda and guidelines are available for their management. This paper aims to  present the Ayurvedic concepts in the management of food intolerance/ allergies  and its correlation with the evidences available from modem scientific  laboratories. The understanding of this ancient wisdom may prove to be of  immense importance in patient care.",How can Ayurveda help manage food allergies and intolerances?,I've been having some weird reactions to certain foods lately. Does Ayurveda have any tips on how to deal with food allergies or intolerances?,"Can Ayurveda help me manage my food allergies and if so, how does it work?"
27,"Ayurveda, the native healthcare system of India, is a rich resource of  well-documented ancient medical knowledge. Although the roots of this knowledge  date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a  dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between  400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these  early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among  the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda  have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine.  In this communication, the discovery of blood circulation has been taken up as a  case, and a few important references from the representative Ayurveda compendia  that hint at a preliminary understanding of the cardiovascular system as a  ""closed circuit"" and the heart acting as a pump have been reviewed. The central  argument of this review is that these contributions from Ayurveda too must be  recorded and credited when reviewing the milestones in the history of medicine,  as Ayurveda can still possibly guide various streams of the current sciences, if  revisited with this spirit.",Can Ayurveda provide any insights into the functioning of the cardiovascular system?,I've heard that Ayurveda has some cool insights about the body. Could it potentially offer natural ways to boost cardiovascular health?,Can Ayurveda provide any natural remedies for heart health or improving blood circulation?
28,"Biodiversity of natural resources has served not only for the primary human  needs but also for health care, since time immemorial. The Indian subcontinent,  with the history of one of the oldest civilization, harbors many traditional  health care systems. Their development was supported by the diverse biodiversity  in flora and fauna due to variations in geographical landscaping. Ayurveda,  whose history goes back to 5000 b.c., is one of the ancient health care systems.  The Ayurveda was developed through daily life experiences with the mutual  relationship between mankind and nature. The ancient text of Ayurveda reports  more than 2000 plant species for their therapeutic potentials. Besides Ayurveda,  other traditional and folklore systems of health care were developed in the  different time periods in Indian subcontinent, where more than 7500 plant  species were used. According to a WHO estimate, about 80% of the world  population relies on traditional systems of medicines for primary health care,  where plants form the dominant component over other natural resources. Renewed  interest of developing as well as developed countries in the natural resources  has opened new horizons for the exploration of natural sources with the  perspectives of safety and efficacy. The development of these traditional  systems of medicines with the perspectives of safety, efficacy and quality will  help not only to preserve this traditional heritage but also to rationalize the  use of natural products in the health care. Until recent past, the nature was  considered as a compendium for templates of new chemical entities (NCEs). The  plant species mentioned in the ancient texts of these Ayurveda and other Indian  systems of medicines may be explored with the modern scientific approaches for  better leads in the health care.",What are some plant species used in traditional Indian health care systems that could improve overall health?,I've heard a lot about natural remedies recently. Are there any ancient health care systems that use plants or other natural resources that could help improve my well-being?,What kind of plants from Ayurveda could I use to improve my health naturally?
29,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) show a hazardous potential for humans and animals.  They can possess mutagenic, teratogenic, cancerogenic and fetotoxic properties.  One pathway of a human intoxication can be the use of medicinal plants which  contain toxic PAs. The Traditional Indian medicine--in particular Ayurveda--is a  popular and well-known healing system. Within this system several PA-containing  plants are used which, on account of their PA level, represent a severe health  risk. In general, it is not recommended to use plants containing those toxic  compounds.",What are the health risks associated with using plants that contain Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in traditional Indian medicine?,I've heard a lot about Ayurveda and was thinking of trying it out. Should I be worried about any dangerous ingredients in their medicinal plants?,I've heard that some traditional Indian medicines can be harmful. How can I make sure the natural remedies I'm using don't contain any dangerous substances?
30,"The word Rasashaastra literally means the ""Science of Mercury"". It is a  specialized branch of Ayurveda dealing mainly with materials which are known as  'Rasa dravyaas'. The products dealt under this discipline are an important  component of Ayurvedic therapeutics. Considering the importance of this  discipline in Ayurvedic therapeutics and the fact that there is dearth of  comprehensive review on the subject an attempt has been made in this review to  provide a brief but all encompassing coverage of different aspects related to  it. The subjects covered in the review are: historical background of the  evolvement of Rasashaastra as a specialized branch during different time  periods; different aspects of classification 'Rasa dravyaas'; processing of  metal and mineral products with a note on the methods used during different time  periods; information about methods of pre and post preparation procedures for  different kinds of 'Rasa dravyaas'; importance of mercury in Ayurveda, its  processing methods and different preparations along with therapeutic  indications. In addition attempt has been made to provide basic information on  the metal and mineral based preparations mentioned in Ayurvedic Formulary of  India; recent development in the field of Rasashaastra and future requirements  for the proper development of the discipline. The main focus is to familiarize  the readers, from non-ayurvedic background, on different aspects of this  specialized discipline.",What is the role of mercury in Ayurvedic treatments and how is it prepared?,"I've heard a bit about Ayurveda before, but what exactly is this Rasashaastra thing and how can it be used for health treatments?","What is this ""Science of Mercury"" in Ayurveda that I've heard about and how could it help improve my health naturally?"
31,"Drug discovery strategies based on natural products and traditional medicines  are re-emerging as attractive options. We suggest that drug discovery and  development need not always be confined to new molecular entities. Rationally  designed, carefully standardized, synergistic traditional herbal formulations  and botanical drug products with robust scientific evidence can also be  alternatives. A reverse pharmacology approach, inspired by traditional medicine  and Ayurveda, can offer a smart strategy for new drug candidates to facilitate  discovery process and also for the development of rational synergistic botanical  formulations.",Can traditional herbal formulations be an effective alternative to modern medicines?,"So, I've heard that traditional medicines can actually be pretty effective. Any truth to this?",Can traditional herbal remedies be a good alternative for modern medicines?
32,"Although many drugs have been developed by pharmaceutical companies, there are  many diseases which can not be cured with these drugs. In order to overcome this  problem, the combination of Western and Eastern medicine has been proposed.  Ayurveda is traditional Indian medicine established B.C. and is accepted  throughout the world today. Due to its effectiveness and fewer side effects,  Ayurveda will provide us with many hints for drug development. In the present  review, we discuss the possible application of Ayurveda in drug development  taking into account the following two points, i) herbs used in Ayurveda contain  many unknown active components, and ii) Ayurveda provides new therapeutic  approaches. In the case of drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis, we get  hints from active components in the herbs used in Ayurveda. For rheumatism, we  obtain hints for new pharmacological approaches from this medicinal approach.",Can Ayurveda provide any solutions for the treatment of chronic hepatitis?,Could traditional Indian medicine like Ayurveda help with my chronic joint pain since regular medicine doesn't seem to do much?,I've been dealing with chronic hepatitis for a while now.

33,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by the severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patients with COVID-19 may  be treated with traditional medicine like Ayurveda alone or in combination with  standard allopathic treatment, as Ayurveda is one of the oldest traditional  medicinal systems followed by millions around the world. METHODS: The literature was searched in databases such as LitCOVID, Google  Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCO, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and reference  lists to identify articles relevant to the use of Ayurvedic medicines in the  management of COVID-19. RESULTS: Several clinical studies have determined the efficacy of Ayurvedic  medicines and formulations in the management of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The Ayurvedic medicines and formulations with antiviral,  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties could be used  along with standard allopathic medicines to assist in the earlier detection of  virus, speedy recovery of patients with COVID-19, faster discharge from  hospitals, and the prevention of further deterioration.",Can Ayurvedic medicines be used alongside standard treatments to manage COVID-19 symptoms?,"So, can I use Ayurvedic remedies along with regular meds to recover faster from COVID-19?",Can Ayurvedic medicines be used alongside my regular medication to help with my COVID-19 recovery?
34,"Background Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine, has been practised in India  since ages. We evaluated the overall awareness regarding Ayurveda among patients  attending two specialty clinics at a tertiary care institute. Methods We did a  cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics  at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using  a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed  using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed  to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among  them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that  Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations  (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%).  Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and  newspaper advertisements (13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined  that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of  participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be  beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had  Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to  participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine.  Conclusion Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail  in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed. We found imprecise  knowledge of Ayurvedic therapies and its low usage among patients attending  specialized OPDs in a tertiary care hospital. The major source of information  reported was promotional advertisements in the print and electronic media. Our  survey shows a need for awareness programmes for general public at various  levels.",What are some ways to increase public awareness about the benefits of Ayurveda?,I've heard a lot about Ayurveda on TV and in newspapers.

35,"Under the aegis of the World Health Organization, the Movement for Global Mental  Health and an Indian Supreme Court ruling, biomedical psychiatric interventions  have expanded in India augmenting biomedical hegemony in a place that is known  for its variety of healing modalities. This occurs despite the fact that studies  by the WHO show better outcomes in India for people suffering from schizophrenia  and related diagnoses when compared to people in developed countries with  greater access to biomedical psychiatry. Practitioners of ayurvedic medicine in  Kerala have been mounting a claim for a significant role in public mental health  in the face of this growing hegemony.This study examines efforts by ayurvedic  practitioners to expand access to ayurvedic mental health services in Kerala,  and profiles a rehabilitation center which combines biomedical and ayurvedic  therapies and has been a key player in efforts to expand the use of Ayurveda for  mental health. The paper argues for maintaining a pluralistic healing  environment for treating mental illness rather than displacing other healing  modalities in favor of a biomedical psychiatric approach.",Can Ayurvedic therapies be effective in treating mental health issues?,"I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda recently. How can it help with my mental health struggles, especially when compared to traditional therapy or medication?",I've been feeling quite down lately. Are there any natural or traditional treatments in India that could help improve my mental health?
36,"Within the disciplines of modern medicine, P4 medicine is emerging as a new  field which focuses on the whole patient. The development of Ayurgenomics could  greatly enrich P4 medicine by providing a clear theoretical understanding of the  whole patient and a practical application of ancient and modern preventative and  therapeutic practices to improve mental and physical health. One of the most  difficult challenges today is understanding the ancient concepts of Ayurveda in  terms of modern science. To date, a number of researchers have attempted this  task, of which one of the most successful outcomes is the creation of the new  field of Ayurgenomics. Ayurgenomics integrates concepts in Ayurveda, such as  Prakriti, with modern genetics research. It correlates the combination of three  doshas, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, with the expression of specific genes and  physiological characteristics. It also helps to interpret Ayurveda as an ancient  science of epigenetics which assesses the current state of the doshas, and uses  specific personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations to improve a patient's  health. This review provides a current update of this emerging field.",How can Ayurgenomics help improve my mental and physical health through personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations?,I've heard about Ayurveda and personalized diets. Can they actually help me to feel healthier and more balanced?,Can this Ayurgenomics approach suggest any specific diet or lifestyle changes that could help improve my overall health?
37,"In the past two decades, health care has become a global market and  transnational practice. An emerging body of literature examines the astounding  variety of drivers, conditions, and experiences. However, the question of how  traveling abroad for treatment emerges as an option and takes shape in people's  illness trajectories has gained little attention thus far. This article attends  to this gap by following the stories of people with chronic conditions who  travel to India for Ayurveda treatment out of dissatisfaction with local  biomedical health care. This study expands the focus of current research on  transnational therapeutic mobilities in three ways: (1) by shifting the  attention from being a foreign patient or medical traveler to becoming one, (2)  by integrating quests for other-than-biomedical therapies, and (3) by applying a  narrative approach to the field. Results show that apart from social, human, and  financial resources, it takes certain patient-subjectivities to mobilize  patients across borders and healing systems.",What factors might lead someone to seek Ayurveda treatment in India for chronic conditions?,"I'm not really happy with the healthcare I'm getting here.

38,"Brahmavaivartapurana is one of the important Mahapurana, which is considered as  a Vaisnavapurana. The text is divided into four parts called khanda i.e.,  Brahma, Prakrti, Ganapati, and Srikrsnajanmakhanda. The total number of chapters  are 276 and comprising about 20,500 verses. Brahmavaivartapurana comprises both  ancient and medieval materials. It considers Ayurveda as Pancama Veda and  devoted 16th chapter of Brahmakhanda which describes the origin of Ayurveda its  propagaters headed by Bhaskara (sun god) and his 16 students and their  corresponding books in detail. An account of the Jvara (Fever) and other  diseases, Dinacarya (daily routine), Rtucarya (seasonal regimen), Tridosa (three  humours), their Prakopa (Vitiation) and Praśamana (palliation) etc are described  in this book. BVP deals with the do's and dont's of food intake, sleep and  sexual indulgance in detail which are deemed to be Trayopastambha (three sub  pillers of health). The book provides an account of Plant Tulsi's origin and its  spiritual importance. Prakrti (nature's) origins, Pañcamahabhuta nature of the  body are described in Prakrtikhanda. At the flag end of the book there is a  legend describing the origin of Lord Dhanvantari and describes his scholarship  in the field of Veda and śastra. On the whole purana provides glimpse of the  life style of a Vaisnava devoutee and the people of the time when it was  compiled.

Using data gathered from an Ayurvedic treatment program, this study  examined the role of psychosocial factors in the process of behavior change and  the salutogenic process. This observational study examined associations with  participation in the 5-day Ayurvedic cleansing retreat program, Panchakarma.  Quality of life, psychosocial, and behavior change measurements were measured  longitudinally on 20 female participants. Measurements were taken before the  start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram.  The program did not significantly improve quality of life. Significant  improvements were found in self-efficacy towards using Ayurveda to improve  health and reported positive health behaviors. In addition, perceived social  support and depression showed significant improvements 3 months postprogram  after the subjects had returned to their home context.

42,"Ayurveda, the science of life, is a comprehensive medical system that has been  the traditional system of healthcare in India for more than 5000 years. This  medical system was well established around 2500 to 600 BC, when it evolved into  2 schools: the School of Physicians and the School of Surgeons, similar to  allopathy. Charak Samhita, Susrut Samhita, and Ashtang Hridaya Samhita are the  Senior Triad texts, and Madhav Nidan Samhita, Sarangdhar Samhita, and  Bhavprakash Samhita are the Junior Triad texts. Around 600 BC. Ayurveda was  branched into internal medicine; pediatrics; psychiatry; surgery; eye, ear,  nose, and throat; toxicology; geriatrics; and eugenics/aphrodisiacs. The body is  composed of 3 body doshas, 3 mental doshas, 7 dhatus, and malas. The harmony  among the body doshas of vata (nervous system), pitta (enzymes), and kapha  (mucus) and the gunas, or mental doshas (which are human attributes: satogun  [godly], rajas [kingly], and tamas [evil]), constitutes health, and their  disharmony constitutes disease. The management of illness requires balancing the  doshas back into a harmonious state through lifestyle interventions, spiritual  nurturing, and treatment with herbo-mineral formulas based on one's mental and  bodily constitution.",What is the Ayurvedic approach to balancing mental and physical health?,"So, I've been feeling kind of off balance lately, like mentally and physically.

43,"Modern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is  likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it  is practised. The mechanistic model which served biomedicine well for many years  is gradually collapsing, thanks to the efforts of dedicated researchers who have  looked beyond that model's flaws. Thus we now know that networks of chemical  communication exist between the nervous and immune systems, and that prayer at a  distance can positively affect the conditions of those who are seriously ill,  even when the prayer and the patient are not known to one another. Another  participant in this exciting climate of change and ferment is Ayurveda, India's  ancient medical system. While Ayurveda has already contributed much to modern  medicine (reserpine, gugulipid, plastic surgery), its real contributions are yet  to be made. While some of these are likely to come in matters of materia medica  and technique, most will likely be derived from Ayurveda's way of seeing the  world, its ""darshana."" This paper outlines a few of the ways in which Ayurveda's  ""vision"" is likely to facilitate medicine's ability to teach people not just how  to avoid disease but how to proactively develop and maintain a healthy ""state.""",What is Ayurveda and how can it contribute to maintaining a healthy lifestyle?,"So, I heard about this Ayurveda thing from India, it seems pretty cool.

44,"Network pharmacology is an emerging technique, which integrates systems biology  and computational biology to study multi-component and multi-targeted  formulations. Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, uses  intelligent formulations; however, their scientific rationale and mechanisms  remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the potential of network  pharmacology to understand the rationale of a commonly used Ayurveda formulation  known as Triphala. We have developed pharmacology networks of Triphala based on  the information gathered from different databases and using the software  Cytoscape. The networks depict the interaction of bioactives with molecular  targets and their relation with diseases, especially cancer. The network  pharmacology analysis of Triphala has offered new relationships among  bioactives, targets and putative applications of cancer etiology. This  pioneering effort might open new possibilities to know pharmacodynamics of  Ayurvedic drugs like Triphala and also help in the discovery of new leads and  targets for various diseases.",How can Ayurvedic formulations like Triphala potentially be used in cancer treatment?,I've heard about this Ayurvedic remedy called Triphala.

48,"OBJECTIVE: Ayurveda is commonly used in South Asia to treat knee osteoarthritis  (OA). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment compared to  conventional conservative care in patients with knee OA. METHOD: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria knee OA  patients were included in a multicenter randomized, controlled, open-label trial  and treated in 2 hospital clinics and 2 private outpatient clinics in Germany.  Participants received either a multi-modal Ayurvedic treatment or multi-modal  conventional care with 15 treatments over 12 weeks respectively. Primary outcome  was the change on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis  (WOMAC) Index after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales; the  pain disability index and a pain experience scale, numeric rating scales for  pain and sleep quality, quality-of-life and mood, rescue medication use, and  safety issues. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one participants (Ayurveda n = 77, conventional care  n = 74) were included. Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were  more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95%CI: 52.4;69.6])  than in the conventional group (32.0 [95%CI: 21.4;42.6]) resulting in a  significant between-group difference (p < 0.001) and a clinically relevant  effect size (Cohen's d 0.68 [95% CI:0.35;1.01]). Similar trends were observed  for all secondary outcomes at week 12. Effects were sustained at follow-ups  after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that Ayurvedic treatment is beneficial in reducing  knee OA symptoms. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the magnitude  of the effect and to clarify the role of different treatment components and  non-specific effects.

49,"Objectives: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a well-known student-centered  instructional approach that is known to enhance problem-solving skills among the  learners. Because teaching/learning methods in most of the Ayurveda colleges in  India are still didactic and teacher centric, the effects of introducing PBL  have not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to develop  PBL modules for Kriya Sharira (Ayurveda Physiology) and their implementation in  a hybrid format. In this method, PBL is used as an add-on component along with  didactic lectures. The secondary objective of the study was to compare the  learning outcomes achieved through hybrid problem-based learning (HPBL) with  those achieved through conventional teaching. Design: This is a prospectively  planned post-test-only, controlled interventional design with nonequivalent  groups. However, the results have been analyzed in a retrospective manner.  Subjects: Students enrolled in the first professional Bachelor of Ayurvedic  Medicine and Surgery program during two consecutive academic sessions 2016-2017  and 2017-2018 at the Banaras Hindu University were included in the study. While  the cohort from 2016 to 2017 session served as the control group, the one from  2017 to 2018 session served as the experimental group. Interventions: The  instructional method commonly known as HPBL was introduced to the experimental  group. Outcome measures: Five test papers containing mostly Multiple Choice  Questions for five different topics were used as the tools for evaluating the  learning outcomes in both the groups. Feedback forms regarding the experiences  of undergoing HPBL were obtained from experimental group. Results: While the  test results for three topics showed that the outcomes of HPBL were comparable  with conventional teaching, the results on other two topics suggested that HPBL  was slightly better. Feedback obtained showed that there is a considerable  acceptance for HPBL over conventional method. Conclusions: The study shows that  it is possible to implement HPBL method in a large classroom in the context of  Ayurveda education.

61,"BACKGROUND: In Ayurvedic and Unani texts, many herbs and formulations are  mentioned as complexion promoters having skin brightening and whitening effects  that downregulate melanin synthesis. However, with the assistance of  chromatographic techniques, further validation of scientific standardization is  required. OBJECTIVE: To validate individual herbs and formulations in the ancient  literature, some scientific aspects are to be focused on, including  standardization of herbs or herbal products consisting of the active compounds. METHODS: Out of many herbs having complexion promoting properties, three herbs  (Myristica fragrans, Hemidesmus indicus, and Inula racemosa) were selected for  the study. In the present study, validated reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and  high-performance TLC (HPTLC) methods were developed for standardization of the  herbs. RESULTS: It was observed that the quercetin present in M. fragrans was 0.62%  (w/w) with a retention time (Rt) of 6.23 min, the ferulic acid present in H.  indicus was 1.39% (w/w) with an Rt of 8.083 min, and the chlorogenic acid  present in I. racemosa was 1.03% (w/w) with an Rt of 3.19 min. The HPTLC method  showed 1.23% (w/w) of quercetin present in M. fragrans with a retardation factor  (Rf) of 0.48, ferulic acid in H. indicus was 1.52% (w/w) with an Rf of 0.44, and  chlorogenic acid was 1.09% (w/w) in I. racemosa with an Rf of 0.52.

In  practice, Ayurveda is a dynamic phenomenon that offers multifaceted approaches  to healing. These diverse healing formats develop to meet the constantly  changing needs of the society and of illness patterns. This analysis views  illness and health care in terms of the multiple systems of knowledge and  action, phenomena and interaction, that characterize them as well as in terms of  the medical treatises and institutions that formalize them.

Here,  from the perspective of Unani medicine, we discuss how the saccharide-based  sweeteners may be an essential component of these traditional preparations, like  electuaries, which may be deprived of their bioactivities without these  saccharides. With contemporary researches, it is known that apart from their own  therapeutic effects, saccharides also form deep eutectic solvents which help in  enhancing the bioactivity of other ingredients present in crude drugs. In  addition, they provide energy for fermentation which is essential for  biotransformation of compounds.

It is based on the trisutra, which are the  three aspects of causes, features and therapeutics that are interconnected  through a common organizing principle termed 'tridosha'. Tridosha comprise three  ascertainable physiological entities; vata (kinetic), pitta (metabolic) and  kapha (potential) that are pervasive across systems, work in conjunction with  each other, respond to the external environment and maintain homeostasis. Each  individual is born with a specific proportion of tridosha that are not only  genetically determined but also influenced by the environment during foetal  development. Jointly they determine a person's basic constitution, which is  termed their 'prakriti'. Development and progressi on of different diseases with  their subtypes are thought to depend on the origin and mechanism of perturbation  of the doshas, and the aim of therapeutic practice is to ensure that the doshas  retain their homeostatic state. Similarly, western systems biology epitomized by  translational P4 medicine envisages the integration of multiscalar genetic,  cellular, physiological and environmental networks to predict phenotypic  outcomes of perturbations. In this perspective article, we aim to outline the  shape of a unifying scaffold that may allow the two intellectual traditions to  enhance one another. Specifically, we illustrate how a unique integrative  'Ayurgenomics' approach can be used to integrate the trisutra concept of  Ayurveda with genomics. We observe biochemical and molecular correlates of  prakriti and show how these differ significantly in processes that are linked to  intermediate patho-phenotypes, known to take different course in diseases. We  also observe a significant enr ichment of the highly connected hub genes which  could explain differences in prakriti, focussing on EGLN1, a key oxygen sensor  that differs between prakriti types and is linked to high altitude adaptation.  Integrating our observation with the current literature, we demonstrate how  EGLN1 could qualify as a molecular equivalent of tridosha that can modulate  different phenotypic outcomes, where hypoxia is a cause or a consequence both  during health and diseased states. Our studies affirm that integration of the  trisutra framework through Ayurgenomics can guide the identification of  predisposed groups of individuals and enable discovery of actionable therapeutic  points in an individualized manner.",How can Ayurveda and genomics help in personalized treatment for diseases?,"I've heard about this whole Ayurveda thing, can it help me understand why I feel the way I do or why I get sick sometimes?",Can the Ayurvedic system help me understand my health better and suggest any specific lifestyle changes for my age?
68,"Driven by long-standing ties with India, and intertwined with global market  interests, a growing influx of materia medica from South Asia is currently  emerging in East Africa. To compete at a global level and framed within the  language of 'South-South cooperation for mutual benefit', India presents itself  as an appropriate exporter of medical products suitable for African clientele.  The expansion of India's medical sector into Africa is particularly relevant for  Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals. Ayurveda's diaspora into Africa exemplifies the  emergence of new health interventions and medical assemblages in a  transnationally interconnected world and implies innovative coalitions involved  in the complex promotion of local/Global Health industries. By tracking the flow  of Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals to East Africa, this paper aims to contribute to  the understanding of medical practices as they are configured by the dynamics of  global mobility. It interrogates the extent to which the industrialisation of  Ayurveda occupies a strategic position in Indo-African discursive practices and  the creation of new market opportunities. Moreover, it explores the ways in  which South-South alliances between Indian and African actors produce (new)  solidarities, but also hierarchies and power imbalances. Special attention will  be directed to the political-economic implications of the expansion of  transnational markets.",What are the benefits of Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals from India for African societies?,I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine.

70,"Nano-ayurvedic medicine is an emerging field in which nanoparticles are  functionalized with active principles of potent ayurvedic herbs to enhance their  efficacy and target-specific delivery. Scientific advances in the past couple of  decades have revealed the molecular mechanisms behind the anticancer potential  of several ayurvedic herbs, attributed chiefly to their secondary metabolites  including polyphenols and other active substances. With the advancement of  nanotechnology, it has been established that size-, shape-, and  surface-chemistry-optimized nanoparticles can be utilized as synergizing  carriers for these phytochemicals. Nano-ayurvedic medicine utilizes herbs that  are commonly used in Ayurveda to functionalize different nanoparticles and  thereby enhance their potency and target specificity. Studies have shown that  the active phytochemicals of such herbs can be coated onto the nanoparticles of  different metals, such as gold, and that they work more efficiently than the  free herbal extract, for example, in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.  Recently, an Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy  (AYUSH)-based clinical trial in humans indicated the anticancer potential of  such formulations.

71,"INTRODUCTION: Neurogenic bladder is a common urological condition among elderly.  It results in incontinence or retention of the urine depending on the synergy of  bladder smooth muscles and urethral sphincter. There can also be a condition  where retention causes overflow incontinence. Retention of urine in this  condition is caused by relative lack of contractility of bladder smooth muscles  in response to the stretch reflex. As a result, there is no urge and therefore  the bladder remains over-distended causing retention of urine. Currently, there  are no absolute ways to deal with such a situation except that the patients are  advised for self-help techniques of regularly evacuating the bladder.  Pharmacotherapy for such condition is not promising. As the patients of  neurogenic bladder are often healthy otherwise (with manageable conditions such  as diabetes), a bladder dysfunction is considered as a disability that they do  not want to share. In this state, any approach that offers a regeneration of  bladder reflex and restoration of its functions is more than one can expect for. METHODS: An elderly male suffering with chronic urinary retention recommended  for indwelling catheterization after the failure of voiding trial following the  possible conventional pharmacotherapy was treated with Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS: There was a complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic  therapy. The changes were stable after 3-month follow-up of the patient. CONCLUSION: This case report presents the complete symptom reversal in a case of  chronic urine retention as an outcome of Ayurvedic therapy. Seeing the  importance of this clinical condition and unavailability of sufficient means in  conventional medicine, it requires a serious note and enquiry into its  applicability in similar cases.",Can Ayurvedic therapy help with chronic urinary retention in elderly patients?,I've noticed my grandma struggles with going to the bathroom a lot.

74,"This review focuses on how the study of anatomy in India has evolved through the  centuries. Anatomical knowledge in ancient India was derived principally from  animal sacrifice, chance observations of improperly buried human bodies, and  examinations of patients made by doctors during treatment. The Vedic  philosophies form the basis of the Ayurvedic tradition, which is considered to  be one of the oldest known systems of medicine. Two sets of texts form the  foundation of Ayurvedic medicine, the Susruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita.  The Susruta Samhita provided important surgical and anatomical information of  the understanding of anatomy by Indians in the 6th century BCE.

It has an ancient background of being used  ethnopharmacologically for various body ailments. According to Ayurveda, Unani,  Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Costus roots are recommended for  leukoderma, liver, kidney, blood disorders, Qi stagnation, and tridosha. Root  and powder are used orally with warm water to cure gastric problems, and the  paste is applied to the inflamed area to relieve pain. Root paste is applied on  the skin to cure boils, blisters, and leprosy. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present review is to establish a correlation  among the ethnopharmacological uses and scientific studies conducted on A.  costus with chemical constituents, safety & toxicity data including future  directions for its conservation with higher yield and effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted by studying books, research  papers, and literature in history, agroforestry, phytopharmacology of Himalayan  plants using international databases, publication, Red data book, and reports.  The search engines: Pubmed, Scopus, Wiley Inter-science, Indian Materia Medica,  Science Direct, and referred journals are referenced. RESULTS: The literature collected from databases, journals, websites, and books  mentioned the use of costus roots in local and traditional practices. CITES  included A. costus in a critically endangered category due to lack of cultural  practices and overexploitation from wild. A. costus roots are known since 13th  century for use in ancient Ayurvedic products but the scientific evaluation is  of future research interest. A correlation of traditional uses with scientific  studies has been explored to assess the effect of root powder, extract, oil and  isolated constituents: Costunolids, Saussureamine B and Dehydrocostus lactone  etc. in gastric ulceration and lesions; inhibition of antigen-induced  degranulation, mucin production, number of immune cells, eosinophils, and  expression and secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in asthma. The  inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators is also reported by Cynaropicrin,  Alantolactone, Caryophyllene, Costic acid. Also, the sesquiterpene lactones has  profound effect in inhibition of inflammatory stages and induced apoptotic  cascades in cancer.

86,"The present market for herbal drugs is estimated about ₹40 billion, which is  expected to increase by 16% in next 3-4 years. The current production of many  Ayurvedic herbs is less than their market demand, which incentivizes  adulteration in the Ayurvedic drug supply chain. The present work aims to  highlight the most used Ayurvedic plants that have been listed in the  International Union for Conservation of Nature's ""red list"" of endangered or  vulnerable plants. The future of Ayurvedic medicines from these listed plants is  uncertain, as the collection of herbs from their natural habitat is prohibited  and their cultivation does not meet market demands. Many of these plants, such  as Taxus baccata and T. wallichiana, are endangered and are only grown in their  natural habitats; their cultivation in other areas is impractical. This is the  present state, and will worsen as demand continues to grow, with increasing  populations and increasing adoption of this system of medicine.

The existing methods like agar-cup method  or disc diffusion method are not adequate to study the exclusive antibacterial  effects of the volatile components of aromatic oils due to lack of ideal  diffusion and evaporation from the surface. Hence an attempt is made to develop  a novel approach to assess the antibacterial activity of few aromatic herbs like  Eugenia caryophyllus, Thymus vulgaris, Cinnamonum zeylanium, Cuminum cyminum;  these were extracted with hexane filled in tiny sterile tubes and the volatile  components were tested for their antibacterial properties using standard strains  of gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria grown on agar slants. The results are  expressed as a percent of inhibition of the area on the slants, from the top of  the extract tube.

118,"The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism was identified in ancient India even  before the period of Christ and was treated methodically. The earliest reference  to bradykinesia dates to 600 bc. Evidences prove that as early as 300 bc,  Charaka proposed a coherent picture of parkinsonism by describing tremor,  rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances as its components. The scenario  was further developed by Madhava, Vagbhata, and Dalhana all through history. The  15th-century classic ""Bhasava rajyam"" introduced the term kampavata, which may  be regarded as an ayurvedic analogue of parkinsonism. The pathogenesis of  kampavata centered on the concept of imbalance in the vata factor, which  controls psychomotor activities. The essential element in therapy was the  administration of powdered seed of Mucuna pruriens, or atmagupta, which as per  reports, contains 4%-6% of levodopa. In addition to proving the existence and  identification of parkinsonism in ancient India, the study points to the  significance of ancient Indian Sanskrit works in medical history.",What natural remedies were used in ancient India to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,Did people in ancient India know about Parkinson's disease and did they have any natural treatments for it?,I've been noticing some shaking in my hands lately.

119,"OBJECTIVES: Plaque psoriasis is very embarrassing condition of skin as it  produces itchy rashes and scaly lesions which may not respond well to the  treatment. It can be correlated with Kitibhakushta which is one among the 18  types of Kushta (skin diseases). Several corticosteroids for skin applications  are used now a day's which gives only temporary relief. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36 years old moderate built male patient complains of  blackish skin rashes with itching, pain and scaling all over the body for three  months. Based on the symptoms, Dosha (Biological humors) involved were assessed  as Kapha (binding factors) and Vata (vital force of life) and suggestive of  Kitibhakushta. Diagnosis of the Plaque psoriasis was further confirmed by  biopsy. Classical Kushta treatment was adopted here. As Poorvakarma  (pre-operative procedures), Rukshana (Dehydrating therapy) was done and then  Snehapana (intake of medicated ghee) was administered. Then classical Vamana  (emetic therapy) and Virechana (purgative therapy) were performed. This took  almost one month. After Samsarjana (special diet) patient was administered  Manibhadragula as Shodhana Rasayana for a period of one month. At the end of  Manibhadragula intake, remarkable changes were observed in all the symptoms.  There were significant changes seen in PASI, DLQI and photographs taken before  and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Here the special mode of administration of Manibhadragula as  mentioned in Ashtanga Hridaya helps for Shodhana and the Shodhana itself has  Rasayana action. Drugs also have Rasayana property. This made the authors to  propose a new concept called Shodhana Rasayana.

122,"ETHANOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The process of formation or appearance of a  urinary stone anywhere in the renal tract is known as urolithiasis. It is a  longstanding health problem, known to exist since early age of civilization.  Records about symptoms, signs and treatment strategies of urinary stones  diseases are found in the several ancient texts of traditional medicines such as  Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Siddha and Unani. In Ayurveda,  urolithiasis has been considered as one of the eight most troublesome diseases.  Ayurvedic management and cure of urinary stone involves herbal formulas,  alkaline liquids and surgical procedures. Whereas, TCM recommends polyherbal  drugs, acupuncture and mexibustion for treatment of the urinary stones. Among  these therapies, herbal remedies are in practice till today for the treatment  and cure urinary stone diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature about  pathophysiology of urinary stones and antiurolithiatic plants was undertaken  using the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of  Knowledge and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from publications from  all years until Dec., 2015 by combination of the search terms and Boolean  operators; 'urinary stone' OR 'kidney stone' AND 'plant' OR 'medicine' OR  'antiurolithiatic plants'. Outputs were restricted to those completed studies  only published in English. In this review, literatures about plants which are  used as diuretic and/or in treatment urinary tract infections have not also been  considered. The Plant List and Royal Botanical Garden, Kew databases were used  to authenticate botanical names of plants. Books and monographs published in  English were used to collect information about historical records of  antiurolithiatic plants. RESULTS: Recent pharmacological interventions accredited ancient  antiurolithiatic claims to several plants and their formulations. The majority  of antiurolithiatic plants were found to either dissolve the stones or inhibit  the process of urinary stone formation. Plants such as Phyllanthus niruri L. and  Elymus repens (L.) Gould, as well as herbal products including 'Wu-Ling-San'  formula, 'Cystone' and 'Herbmed' have been proved their utility as promising  antiurolithiatic medicines in the different phases of clinical trials. In  addition, some of the isolated phytochemicals such as berberine, lupeol, khelin,  visnagin, 7-hydroxy-2',4',5'-trimethoxyisoflavone and  7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone were reported to have potent antiurolithiatic  activity. CONCLUSION: In ancient medicinal texts, antiurolithiatic potential has been  ascribed to several plants and their formulations. Present scientific studies  provide scientific evidences for few of these claims however, they are  insufficient to establish many of these plants and herbal formulations as  therapeutic remedies for the treatment and management of urinary stones.  Conversely, findings of pre-clinical and clinical studies about some plants and  herbal formulations are promising, which underlines the utility of herbal  remedies as alternative medicines for the treatment and management of urinary  stones in the future.",What are some herbal remedies for treating and managing urinary stones?,"I've heard that certain plants can help with kidney stones.

123,"OBJECTIVES: This article provides a comprehensive systematic review and  qualitative analysis of the current research investigating Ayurveda chronic  rhinosinusitis (CRS) treatment. CONTENT: PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews was followed and our search  utilized MEDLINE, Embase, Ayush Portal, and Cochrane Library databases. Articles  published prior to March 2022, 10 or more patients that investigated Ayurveda as  a treatment for CRS in humans were included. This resulted in thirteen articles  meeting inclusion criteria. Ayurvedic treatments included herbal medications for  oral consumption, nasal instillation, and steam inhalation used alone or in  combination. All studies concluded that Ayurvedic therapy led to improvements in  subjective CRS symptoms and objective radiographic and hematologic criteria.  However, all 13 studies had a significant risk of bias due to study design and  statistical methods utilized. SUMMARY: Ayurvedic therapy may be a useful CRS treatment for some patients and  overall appears to be well tolerated. However, definitive recommendation for  when Ayurvedic treatments would be beneficial in the treatment of CRS remains  not possible. OUTLOOK: Given the overall positive effects shown in the current published  evidence and growing interest in complementary and integrative therapies,  Ayurvedic treatments for CRS deserve further investigation in the form of  well-designed controlled trials.",Can Ayurvedic treatments be beneficial for chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms?,"I've been dealing with a stuffy nose and sinus issues for a while now.

124,"BACKGROUND: Ardita (facial paralysis) is a medical condition that disfigures or  distorts the facial appearance of the sufferer causing facial asymmetry and  malfunction. Ardita patients may benefit from considering alternative treatments  such as Ayurveda, including Taila Nasya (nasal instillation of medicated oil). OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in the treatment of Ardita. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Studies conducted on adult sufferers  (18-70 years) of Ardita (chronic or acute) in any setting were considered.  Studies including participants who were pregnant or suffered allergic rhinitis,  fever, intracranial tumor/hemorrhage and bilateral facial palsy were excluded. INTERVENTION(S)/COMPARATOR(S): Standalone treatment of Nasya (at all dosages and  frequencies) compared to Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic treatments  was considered. Comparisons between different interventions including Taila  Nasya alone, Taila Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic interventions and  Ayurvedic interventions that did not include Taila Nasya were also considered. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Ardita symptoms, including facial distortion,  speech disorders and facial pain, were measured. TYPES OF STUDIES: All quantitative study designs (experimental,  quasi-experimental and observational) were considered. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant studies were identified following a comprehensive  literature search. References provided within these key studies identified  additional resources. Indian universities were also contacted for results of  Ardita studies undertaken in their institutions.A three-step search strategy  aimed to find studies of published and unpublished studies was undertaken.  Studies published in the English language were considered for inclusion,  irrespective of publication date/year. Following an initial limited search of  MEDLINE and CINAHL, the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of  the index terms used to describe each articles were analyzed. From the  identified keywords and index terms, searches were undertaken across all  relevant databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus, Centre  for Review and Dissemination databases, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP),  EMBASE, EBM Reviews, DHARA, Google Scholar, MedNar and ProQuest Dissertations.  Finally, reference lists of identified theses and articles were searched for  additional studies. Universities and website operators related to Ayurvedic  research in India were contacted, including the National Institute of Ayurveda  for relevant studies. Besides this, the University of Adelaide librarian was  contacted to retrieve those studies identified in the reference lists of theses  and articles. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were critically assessed by the review author  and a secondary reviewer prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized  critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted by the primary reviewer using the  standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Different interventions and comparators across studies precluded  meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Only two pseudo randomized studies with a small number of participants  met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study with 20  participants, divided equally into two groups compared the effectiveness of two  nasal instillations in alleviating four Ardita symptoms. The second study of 15  participants each in two groups compared the effectiveness of nasal instillation  with placement of medicated oil on the head on seven Ardita symptoms.  Observational measurements of Ardita symptoms were graded as Mild, Moderate or  Marked at baseline and after one month. The study conducted on 30 participants  using Nasya intervention showed participants had better relief from the symptoms  of facial pain, speech disorder and earache within the range of 78.2% to 90.9%,  graded as Marked. Along with statistical data available in the studies, this  review found low levels of evidence favoring Taila Nasya intervention. The  review did not include any studies examining effectiveness of Nasya compared to  conventional treatment for Ardita. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents extremely limited evidence from only two small  experimental studies that administration of Nasya oil alone may provide some  relief from Ardita symptoms of facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to  shut eyelids/upward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. No  strong conclusions may be drawn from the evidence included in the review due to  the limited number of studies, limited number of participants and poor quality  of studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Practitioners should advice Ardita patients that  there is extremely limited evidence suggesting the potential effectiveness of  Nasya oils alone or Nasya in conjunction with other Ayurvedic treatments in  managing symptoms. However, given the absence of a strong evidence base,  practitioners should be guided by clinical wisdom and patient preference. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Well controlled clinical trials comparing standalone  Nasya therapy to other Ayurvedic treatments and/or conventional medicine for  Ardita symptoms need to be conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in treating Ardita.",What are some Ayurvedic treatments that may help with symptoms of facial paralysis?,"I've been having some issues with my face feeling a bit weird and off-balance.

125,"Pongamia pinnata root has been advocated in Ayurveda for treatment of various  inflammatory and infective conditions including ulcers. Sequential petroleum  ether, benzene, chloroform, acetone and ethanolic extracts of P. pinnata roots  when administered in the dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p. in rats was found to have  anti-inflammatory, analgesic activity while pentobarbitone-induced 'sleep time'  was reduced by all the extracts except petroleum ether which, however, enhanced  it. They were also found to possess antiulcer effects when administered either  by i.p. (45 min before) or oral route (45 min before or for 4 days) against  restraint-stress or pylorus-ligated gastric ulcers in rats, the maximum  protection being afforded by petroleum ether and ethanol extracts. The mechanism  of antiulcer effect could either be due to decrease in acid-pepsin secretion and  augmentation of mucin secretion as observed with ethanol extract, while  petroleum ether extract might be producing the effect by virtue of its  anti-stress activity.",Can the root of Pongamia Pinnata be used to treat inflammation and ulcers?,"I've been dealing with a lot of stomach ulcers and inflammation lately.

126,"Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the  disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 transmission on  different levels showed that the cold and dry climate, hot wind and relative  humid wind, maximum wind speed, turbulent wind, intensified recirculating flow  were causing transmission higher than factors. The role of environmental factors  described in Ayurveda like air, water, soil, season, frequent earthquakes,  sunlight exposure, frequent thunderstorm with lightening, and factors from  arthropods were revalidated in perspective of COVID-19 transmission.

127,"Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing systems within complementary and  alternative medicine. However, the evidence for its effectiveness is  unsatisfactory. The aim of this work was to review and meta-analyze the  effectiveness and safety of different Ayurvedic interventions in patients with  osteoarthritis (OA). 138 electronic databases were searched through August 2013.  Randomized controlled trials, randomized crossover studies, cluster-randomized  trials, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials were eligible. Adults with  pre-diagnosed OA were included as participants. Interventions were included as  Ayurvedic if they were explicitly labeled as such. Main outcome measures were  pain, physical function, and global improvement. Risk of bias was assessed using  the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 19 randomized and 14 non-randomized controlled  trials on 12 different drugs and 3 non-pharmaceutical interventions with a total  of 2,952 patients were included. For the compound preparation, Rumalaya, large  and apparently unbiased effects beyond placebo were found for pain (standardized  mean difference [SMD] -3.73; 95 % confidence interval [CI] -4.97, -2.50; P <  0.01) and global improvement (risk ratio 12.20; 95 % CI 5.83, 25.54; P < 0.01).  There is also some evidence that effects of the herbal compound preparation  Shunti-Guduchi are comparable to those of glucosamine for pain (SMD 0.08; 95 %  CI -0.20, 0.36; P = 0.56) and function (SMD 0.15; 95 % CI -0.12, 0.36; P =  0.41). Based on single trials, positive effects were found for the compound  preparations RA-11, Reosto, and Siriraj Wattana. For Boswellia serrata, Lepidium  Sativum, a Boswellia serrata containing multicomponent formulation and the  compounds Nirgundi Taila, Panchatikta Ghrita Guggulu, and Rhumayog, and for  non-pharmacological interventions like Ayurvedic massage, steam therapy, and  enema, no evidence for significant effects against potential methodological bias  was found. No severe adverse events were observed in all trials. The drugs  Rumalaya and Shunti-Guduchi seem to be safe and effective drugs for treatment of  OA-patients, based on these data. However, several limitations relate to  clinical research on Ayurveda.

128,"This paper describes three interconnected conceptions of the body in  kalarippayattu, the martial tradition of Kerala, South India. It traces  continuities and discontinuities among concepts and practices recorded in  classic source texts and contemporary martial practice for each of the three  'bodies of practice'. The first is the fluid body of humors and saps. The second  is the body as superstructure composed of bones, muscles, and vital spots  (marma-s), which supports the fluid body. The concepts and practices of the  first two bodies are based on the regional tradition of Ayurveda. They  constitute the external physical body (sthula-śarira). The third, subtle or  interior body (suksma-śarira) is thought to be encased within the physical body.  It provides an experiential map of practice and is the basis for higher stages  of meditation. The long-term practice of the martial art (1) makes the body  fluid so that healthful congruence of the humors occurs, (2) establishes an  intuitive and practical knowledge of vital points (marma) useful in fighting  (prayogam) and in treating injuries, and (3) purifies the subtle body and  awakens the internal vital energy (prana-vayu) that is manifest as the power  (śakti) of the master in combat or medical practice. The paper concludes with a  discussion of the interrelationship between these three concepts of the body in  the accomplished practice of the martial practitioner.",What are some benefits of practicing the martial art kalarippayattu for overall body health?,I've been hearing a lot about martial arts being good for your health.

129,"Plants from all over the world such as Eleutherococcus senticosus, Panax  ginseng, Raponticum carthamoides, Rhodiola rosea, Withania somnifera and Ocimum  sanctum have been extensively evaluated for their adaptogenic potential.  However, none of them has been successfully introduced as an adaptogen in the  clinic. This paper discusses some of the problems in evaluation of adaptogens  which have precluded their inclusion as clinically useful drugs. We further  discuss our results with six rasayana plants from Ayurveda, which were studied  for their adaptogenic potential. The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of  selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis,  Withania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered  orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose,  following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and  chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these  stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective  parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced  alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a  normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.  All the plants reversed the effects of cisplatin on gastric emptying, while  Tinospora cordifolia and Asparagus racemosus also normalized cisplatin induced  intestinal hypermotility. Tinospora cordifolia was also tested for its ability  to modulate the changes occurring in the phagocytic activity of peritoneal  macrophages after exposure of rats to either carbon tetrachloride or horse  serum. It was found to normalize the phagocytic function irrespective to the  direction of change, complying to the definition of an adaptogen. All the plant  drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies  on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced  immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress  induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked.  Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical  damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to  depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent  data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia suggest that it may induce genotypic  adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.",What are some plants that have been studied for their potential to help the body adapt to stress?,I've been feeling super stressed out lately.

132,"Traditionally, the herbal drugs are well established for their therapeutic  benefits. Depending upon their geographical sources sometimes the trace and  heavy metals' content may differ, which may lead to severe toxicity. So, the  toxicological and safety assessment of these herbal drugs are one of the major  issues in recent days. Eight different plant species including Aloe vera,  Centella asiatica, Calendula officinalis, Cucumis sativus, Camellia sinensis,  Clitoria ternatea, Piper betel and Tagetes erecta were selected to determine  their heavy and trace metals content and thereby to assure their safer  therapeutic application. The trace and heavy metals were detected through atomic  absorption spectrometry analysis. The selected medicinal plant materials were  collected from the local cultivated regions of West Bengal, India, and were  digested with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid as specified. Absorbance was  measured through atomic absorption spectrometer (AA 303) and the concentration  of different trace and heavy metals in the plant samples were calculated. The  quantitative determinations were carried out using standard calibration curve  obtained by the standard solutions of different metals. The contents of heavy  metals were found to be within the prescribed limit. Other trace metals were  found to be present in significant amount. Thus, on the basis of experimental  outcome, it can be concluded that the plant materials collected from the  specific region are safe and may not produce any harmful effect of metal  toxicity during their therapeutic application. The investigated medicinal plants  contain trace metals such as copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron  (Fe) and nickel (Ni) as well as heavy metals such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and  mercury (Hg), which were present within the permissible limit.",Are herbal drugs from certain regions safer due to lower levels of toxic metals?,"I've been thinking about trying some herbal remedies for my health issues, but I'm worried about harmful stuff in them, like heavy metals.

135,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants like Mucuna pruriens L.(DC) and  Withania somnifera L.(Dunal) have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to  manage neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. AIM: The aim of this review is to share the role of Ayurveda's insights,  traditional usage and contemporary investigations for translational, integrative  applications to manage Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High impact journals for Parkinson's diseases,  traditional textbooks from Ayurveda as well as relevant clinical and para  clinical studies with botanicals are selectively incorporated to evolve the  aforesaid translational application. RESULTS: . A. CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING AND EXISTING THERAPEUTIC GAPS: Parkinson's disease  (PD) is a complex multi-system, neurodegenerative disease. Though predominantly  perceived as a motor disease, it also has debilitating non- motor features,  which are frequently missed and not treated. Major treatment goals are to  increase striatal dopamine levels with precursor-substitution and/or reduce its  breakdown. As the disease progresses, a steady increase in the dose of levodopa  is inevitable. However, higher doses cause motor complications of dyskinesia and  dystonia and compromise medical treatment. B. ROLE OF MUCUNA PRURIENS L.DC), THE  MOST PROMISING BOTANICAL FROM AYURVEDA: Ayurveda offers a natural source of  levodopa - the seeds of Mucuna pruriens L.(DC)- which have a long standing safe  use in the condition. Its clinical studies have shown pharmacokinetic profile  distinct from synthetic levodopa, which is likely to reduce the untoward motor  complications. Additionally, its seed extracts have shown neuroprotective  benefits which are unrelated to levodopa. C. AYURVEDIC REGIMENS AND MEDICINAL  PLANTS FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE AND SYMPTOMATIC BENEFITS: Other regimens  (Panchakarma) and medicinal plants used in Ayurveda have been subjected to  exploratory studies with promising early results in the condition. The  debilitating non motor symptoms in patients have shown response with one of the  regimens - medicated oil enema (basti). Effects of two medicinal plants Withania  somnifera(L.)Dunal and Curcuma longa Linn in Parkinson's Disease related models  have been discussed in detail. We have also shared a shortlist of medicinal  plants most likely to be useful in management of specific features of the  disease such as cognitive decline, mood disorders, risk of osteoporosis amongst  others. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda with its medicinal plants and treatment approaches, can  strengthen the therapeutic armamentarium of PD to improve clinical outcomes, if  these leads are systematically further investigated by well-designed longer term  studies.",What are some Ayurvedic treatments or medicinal plants that could help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms?,I've heard that Parkinson's can start showing symptoms at any age.

136,"This paper critically examines the Ayurvedic concept of cancer diathesis and its  pathogenesis in terms of the theory of Tridosa, Sapta Dhātus (body tissues), the  Agni or body's biologic fire, Srotámsi (i.e., channels of the body), and the  generic sequence of events in the genesis of a disease (e.g., Satkriyākala). All  this depicts a new paradigm of the disease state. This paper also examines the  scope of plant drugs used in the treatment of cancer. A retrospective  meta-analysis of observations on 85 plant drugs reported to have an anticancer  effect indicates that herbs with Katu, Tikta, Kasāya Rasa (bitter, pungent, and  astringent taste), Usna Virya (e.g., hot biopotency), and Katu Vipāka (catabolic  active metabolites), and herbs with dry, coarse, light, and sharp biophysical  properties have significantly greater possibilities of producing anticancer  effects.",What types of herbs are used in Ayurvedic medicine for treating cancer?,I've heard that some herbs might help in cancer prevention.

137,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha has been used as an ayurvedic  medicine in the form of 'Rasayana' (as a tonic) even before 3000 BCE in India.  As per Ayurveda, it has long been used traditionally for the treatment of  inflammation, weakness, impotence, pulmonary tuberculosis. This plant is also  beneficial in lumbago and leucorrhea in the female. In the recent past, Withania  has shown its anti-cancerous activity in various experimental models. In  addition, Withania also possesses many other properties such as anti-oxidant,  anti-stress, adaptogenic, and regenerative which will eventually be beneficial  and safe in treating cancer patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review aims to provide experimental evidence along with a  deeper insight into molecular mechanisms of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.)  Dunal) through which it acts as a chemotherapeutic agent against different types  of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature searches with the help of electronic online  databases (Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scopus, Springer Link, ScienceDirect,  ResearchGate, PubMed) were carried out. The timeline for collection of data for  the review article was from 2000 to 2019. The plant name was validated from The  Plant List (2013). Version 1.1. Published on  http://www.theplantlist.org/(accessed 21st March 2020). RESULTS: Various forms of Withania somnifera were used and several in vitro, in  vivo, and clinical studies were reported by researchers. They found ashwagandha  to exhibit anti-apoptotic, anti-metastatic, anti-invasive and anti-inflammatory  properties and gave the evidence that ashwagandha has a capability for averting  and treating breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Various in vitro and in vivo studies suggested Ashwagandha may  possess a potential for treating breast cancer, especially ER/PR positive breast  cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. A clinical trial has also been  conducted in the past that suggested its potential in refining quality of life  in breast cancer patients. Studies directed towards molecular pathways have  helped in unravelling the key mechanisms of ashwagandha. Future research should  be directed towards translational studies involving breast cancer patients.  These will reinforce the ancient power of our Ayurvedic medicine.",Can Ashwagandha be used as a natural treatment for breast cancer?,I've been hearing a lot about this plant called Ashwagandha. Is it true that it can help prevent or even treat breast cancer?,I've heard Ashwagandha might have some health benefits. Could it possibly help in preventing or treating breast cancer?

139,"Āyurveda, the science (ved) of life (ayu), owing its origin to Veda, the oldest  recorded wisdom of human civilization written in 3500 BCE, contains extensive  knowledge of various diseases and their therapeutic approaches. It essentially  relied on nature and the immune system of an individual, and therapeutic  interventions were introduced only to augment the immune system. Āyurveda had  eight specialties, including psycho-neuroscience (a combination of psychology,  clinical psychology and psychiatry) and a unique promotive therapy encompassing  nutrition, rejuvenation and geriatrics. The symptoms of various brain disorders,  including memory disorder, were well defined. The goal of Āyurveda was to help  an individual to achieve his cherished goal of leading a healthy life of 100  years. To achieve this, great emphasis was laid on nutrition, diet and a good  conduct by the two great exponents of Āyurveda viz. Carak and Suśruta. By  following these regimens, an individual could lead a less stressful life free  from emotional disturbances.

143,"BACKGROUND: Literature searches for articles on Ayurveda provide special  challenges, since many of the Indian journals in which such articles appear are  not indexed by current medical databases such as PubMed and Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials. AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive search strategy on  Ayurveda topics and to map the existing databases containing Ayurveda journal  publications. METHODS: We have developed a literature search procedure that can recover the  great majority of articles on any given topic associated with Ayurveda. RESULTS: Our system is formulated in an easily reproducible fashion that all  researchers can use. Using the keywords related to Ayurveda and vitiligo, we  searched 41 databases that may contain complementary and alternative medicine  publications. Only 11 databases yielded results; PubMed contained 9 articles.  Each of 14 other databases named in our search procedure averaged 23 articles.  International Bibliographic Information of Dietary Supplements, for example,  gave 22, of which 1 satisfied our eligibility criteria.

144,"BACKGROUND: Traditional medicine in India can be classified into codified  (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) and non-codified (folk medicine) systems.  Both the systems contributing equally to the primary healthcare in India. The  present study is aimed to understand the current scenario of medicinal practices  of non-codified system of traditional medicine in Belgaum region, India. METHODS: The study has been conducted as a basic survey of identified  non-codified traditional practitioners by convenience sampling with semi  structured, open ended interviews and discussions. The learning process, disease  diagnosis, treatment, remuneration, sharing of knowledge and socio-demographic  data was collected, analysed and discussed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty traditional practitioners were identified and  interviewed for the present study. These practitioners are locally known as  ""Vaidya"". The study revealed that the non-codified healthcare tradition is  practiced mainly by elderly persons in the age group of 61 years and above  (40%). 73% of the practitioners learnt the tradition from their forefathers, and  19% of practitioners developed their own practices through experimentation,  reading and learning. 20% of the practitioners follow distinctive ""Nadi  Pariksha"" (pulse examination) for disease diagnosis, while others follow bodily  symptoms and complaints. 29% of the traditional practitioners do not charge  anything, while 59% practitioners receive money as remuneration.Plant and animal  materials are used as sources of medicines, with a variety of preparation  methods. The preference ranking test revealed higher education and migration  from villages are the main reasons for decreasing interest amongst the younger  generation, while deforestation emerged as the main cause of medicinal plants  depletion. CONCLUSION: Patrilineal transfer of the knowledge to younger generation was  observed in Belgaum region. The observed resemblance in disease diagnosis, plant  collection and processing between non-codified traditional system of medicine  and Ayurveda require further methodical studies to establish the relationship  between the two on a more objective basis. However, the practice appears to be  at crossroads with threat of extinction, because of non-inheritance of the  knowledge and non-availability of medicinal plants. Hence conservation  strategies for both knowledge and resources at societal, scientific and  legislative levels are urgently required to preserve the traditional wisdom.",What are some traditional Indian practices for diagnosing and treating diseases?,What kind of natural remedies could I expect if I went to a traditional healer in India?,I've heard about these traditional health practices from India.

145,"INTRODUCTION: The Ayurvedic theory of Tri-Dosha offers a unique framework for  understanding human differences in health and disease. The Doshas could be  readily applied in clinical studies to control for such differences the same way  sex, age, height and weight are routinely used except that clinical evaluation  is required and methods vary. No open-source questionnaire has been shown to be  reliable for self-assessment. Therefore, we undertook this study to develop a  reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire with characteristics suitable for  use in clinical research. METHODS: A review of published questionnaires and translations of classic  Ayurvedic texts along with an analysis of item-total correlations and ANOVAs by  Dosha for 735 responses to a 37-item ipsative questionnaire from an Ayurveda  products company served as the basis for generating 108 Dosha-specific test  items featuring a 7-point Likert scale. We used item-total and inter-item  correlations from a convenience sample of 176 individuals to identify the best  performing items. We then solicited repeat responses to the resultant 39-item  questionnaire (13 for each Dosha) from these and other website visitors and  calculated test-retest reliability as the intraclass correlation coefficient for  absolute agreement (ICC 2,1) for each Dosha. RESULTS: The final questionnaire gives normally distributed results. Among 76  self-selected adults, the test-retest reliabilities for Vata, Pitta and Kapha  Dosha scores are all above 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is possible to quantify the three  Doshas with adequate reliability for most clinical studies.",Can I take a self-assessment test to understand my Ayurvedic Dosha balance for better health management?,I've heard about Doshas in Ayurveda.

146,"Chemotherapy drugs and radiotherapy are highly toxic and both damage adjacent  healthy cells. Side effects may be acute (occurring within few weeks after  therapy), intermediate or late (occurring months or years after the therapy).  Some important side effects of chemotherapy are: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  mucositis, alopecia, constipation etc; whereas radiation therapy though  administered locally, can produce systemic side effects such as fatigue,  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, alteration in the taste, sleep disturbance,  headache, anemia, dry skin, constipation etc. Late complications of these  therapies also include pharyngitis, esophagitis, laryngitis, persistent  dysphagia, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, infertility and cognitive deficits. These  arrays of side effects have a devastating effect on the quality of life of  cancer survivors. Due to the inadequacy of most of the radio-protectors and  chemo-protectors in controlling the side effects of conventional cancer therapy  the complementary and alternative medicines have attracted the view of  researchers and medical practitioners more recently. This review aims at  providing a comprehensive management protocol of above mentioned  chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects based on Ayurveda, which is an ancient  system of traditional medicine practiced in Indian peninsula since 5000 BC. When  the major side effects of chemo-radiotherapy are looked through an ayurvedic  perspective, it appears that they are the manifestations of aggravated pitta  dosha, especially under the group of disorders called Raktapitta (haemorrhage)  or Raktadushti (vascular inflammation). Based on comprehensive review of ancient  vedic literature and modern scientific evidences, ayurveda based interventions  are put forth. This manuscript should help clinicians and people suffering from  cancer to combat serious chemo-radiotherapy related side effects through simple  but effective home-based ayurveda remedies. The remedies described are commonly  available and safe.

147,"In ayurvedic system of medicine, it is considered that a living system is made  of panch-mahabuta, in the form of Vata, pitta and kapha at the physical level  and satwa, raja and tama at the mental level. This covers the psychosomatic  constitution and commonly known as the Tridosh theory. The imbalance in these  body humours is the basic cause of any type of disease manifestation. Till date,  several objective parameters have been proposed to monitor the level of these  basic humours but none of them is complete. In this exercise, now it is proposed  to consider free radical theory of diseases as one of the objective parameters.  To be more specific, vata can be monitored in terms of membrane bound signal  transduction, pitta as the process of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of  different proteins (signalling moieties and enzymes) and kapha can be viewed as  the degree of gene expression as protein synthesis. This can be correlated with  the ojas of the body or total body defence mechanism.",Can Ayurveda help in improving my body's defense mechanism?,"So, I've been hearing about this Ayurvedic thing where your health is all about balancing Vata, Pitta, and Kapha... can you explain it in simple terms?

149,"The paper discusses the many forms and representations of cyavanaprāsh,  Ayurveda's best-selling medicine, already mentioned in Caraka's Compendium (c.  200 CE). The medicine's compositions, applications, and meanings, change over  time and from locality to locality. Cyavanaprāsh is, for example, a patriotic  formula, a booster of the immune system, a modern geriatric drug, and one of the  elements in canonical Ayurvedic treatments. In the beginning of the 19th century  cyavanaprāsh was a patriotic formula for fortifying Indian bodies and the  nascent Indian nation. Nowadays the medicine is a Fast Moving Consumer Good  (FMCG) and a money maker for Dabur India Ltd., the world largest Ayurvedic  manufacturer. Instead of vitalising the nation its consumption now promises to  make urban middle class consumers effectively modern. Branding and modern  science must make Dabur Chyawanprash attractive in the eyes of these consumers.  Ayurveda and cyavanaprāsh are also part of a global counter culture marked by  neo-Orientalism and Ayurvedic medicines as facilitators of spirituality. The  marketing of cyavanaprāsh by India's largest Ayurvedic manufacturer is used as a  case study for discussing the proliferation of Ayurvedic brands and its critics.  The imaging of Ayurvedic brands such as Dabur Chyawanprash threatens to obscure  the fact that Ayurveda represents a unique way of looking upon health, disease  and the human body. The proliferation of brands also makes Ayurvedic medicines  more expensive and puts pressure on the natural environment as the main supplier  of Ayurvedic ingredients.","What are the health benefits of taking cyavanaprāsh, an Ayurvedic medicine?","I've heard about this Ayurvedic medicine, cyavanaprāsh, that's supposed to boost your immune system.

150,"PURPOSE: We report a case of a 30 years old Indian sailor with microcytic anemia  (Hb 9.9), persistent abdominal pain, emesis, dark stool, hyperchromic urine,  latent jaundice and asthenia. Lead intoxication was confirmed (blood lead value  of 102 μg/dL). The patient assumed Ayurvedic medicines in the previous months.  Ayurveda is an ancient form of Indian traditional popular medicine aiming to  re-establish health and body function through herbal preparations, heavy metals  are often added. Our purpose was to treat the patient and to establish the  source of poisoning. METHODS: After testing blood and urine lead concentration of other 3 crew  members and analyzing over than 150 products used on the ship professional  exposure was excluded. We analyzed the two Ayurvedic drugs assumed by the  patient with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The patient  underwent three chelation cycles with Calcium Disodium  Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) while monitoring blood and urinary lead  levels. RESULTS: The final blood lead level at discharge, after three chelation cycles,  was 36.27 μg/dL. One of the two drugs contained extremely high concentrations of  lead and mercury. The three different mixtures of this preparation showed lead  concentrations of 12,638.54 mg/kg (Sample 2A), 23,043.02 mg/kg (Sample 2B),  21,352.97 mg/kg (Sample 2C); these levels are much higher than the highest  values reported in literature for the indian soil (32 mg/kg).

151,"BACKGROUND: A large part of the population of India prefers the traditional  medicine (ayurvedic formulations) for primary health care. However, the  effective quality control of herbal medicine is still a big challenge. Numerous  reports indicate noncompliance with Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice  (GMP) guidelines by the manufacturers which may lead to adverse drug reactions  or toxic effects. Asava and arishta are the classical herbal dosage forms  wherein fermentation occurs during production leading to the generation of  ethanol. The presence of ethanol in these preparations may lead to their misuse.  The self-generated ethanol is responsible for extraction of active constituents  and acts as a self-preservative. As the procedure for preparation for asava and  arishta is same, the ethanol content is also expected to be the same  irrespective of the manufacturer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess and compare the  ethanol content of some traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations available  in the market. METHOD: In this study, 20 formulations from 3 different manufacturers available  as over-the-counter products were obtained and their ethanol contents were  determined using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were noted in the ethanol content  of various ayurvedic formulations. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and  validated gas chromatographic method for estimation of ethanol in fermented  ayurvedic formulations was also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSION: The data generated during study reflected poor compliance of GMP  guidelines by the manufacturers and hence the quality is being grossly  compromised posing a safety hazard.",Is it safe to consume Ayurvedic medicines with high ethanol content?,I've been using some ayurvedic remedies I found online.

152,"Epilepsy, that comprises a wide spectrum of neuronal disorders and accounts for  about one percent of global disease burden affecting people of all age groups,  is recognised as apasmara in the traditional medicinal system of Indian  antiquity commonly known as Ayurveda. Towards exploring the molecular level  complex regulatory mechanisms of 63 anti-epileptic Ayurvedic herbs and  thoroughly examining the multi-targeting and synergistic potential of 349  drug-like phytochemicals (DPCs) found therein, in this study, we develop an  integrated computational framework comprising of network pharmacology and  molecular docking studies. Neuromodulatory prospects of anti-epileptic herbs are  probed and, as a special case study, DPCs that can regulate metabotropic  glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are inspected. A novel methodology to screen and  systematically analyse the DPCs having similar neuromodulatory potential  vis-à-vis DrugBank compounds (NeuMoDs) is developed and 11 NeuMoDs are reported.  A repertoire of 74 DPCs having poly-pharmacological similarity with  anti-epileptic DrugBank compounds and those under clinical trials is also  reported. Further, high-confidence PPI-network specific to epileptic  protein-targets is developed and the potential of DPCs to regulate its  functional modules is investigated. We believe that the presented schema can  open-up exhaustive explorations of indigenous herbs towards meticulous  identification of clinically relevant DPCs against various diseases and  disorders.",What are some Ayurvedic herbs that could potentially help with epilepsy?,"I've heard that some herbs might help with epilepsy, do you know if there's any truth to that?",Is there any natural herb mentioned in Ayurveda that might help with my epilepsy?
153,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, Indian traditional system of medicine, is practiced  commonly in South East Asia and in many parts of the world. Many ayurvedic drugs  contain heavy metals and may lead to metal toxicity. Of these, chronic lead  poisoning is the most common. Chronic arsenic poisoning following the use of  ayurvedic medication, though reported, is rare. CASE REPORTS: We describe three patients who presented with features of chronic  arsenic poisoning following prolonged ayurvedic medication use. The diagnosis of  chronic arsenic poisoning was confirmed by high arsenic levels in the blood,  urine, hair, and nails in all the three patients and in ayurvedic drug in two  patients. The ayurvedic medication was discontinued and treatment with  D-penicillamine started. At 6 months after treatment, blood arsenic levels  returned to normal with clinical recovery in all of them. CONCLUSION: Arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication is much less common  than lead poisoning, though mineral ayurvedic medicines may lead to it. We used  D-penicillamine as chelator and all of them recovered.

154,"Ayurveda Bhasma is a metallic-mineral preparation homogenised with herbal juices  or decoctions and modified with heat treatment to apparently detoxify the heavy  metals. It is widely recommended for the treatment of many disease conditions by  practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine in the absence of good  quality clinical trial evidence on its safety and efficacy. Heavy metal-induced  liver injury is widely reported in the literature, and heavy metal adulteration  of non-Bhasma-related Ayurveda and herbal products has been well described.

155,"In Ayurveda system of medicine individuals are classified into seven  constitution types, ""Prakriti"", for assessing disease susceptibility and drug  responsiveness. Prakriti evaluation involves clinical examination including  questions about physiological and behavioural traits. A need was felt to develop  models for accurately predicting Prakriti classes that have been shown to  exhibit molecular differences. The present study was carried out on data of  phenotypic attributes in 147 healthy individuals of three extreme Prakriti  types, from a genetically homogeneous population of Western India. Unsupervised  and supervised machine learning approaches were used to infer inherent structure  of the data, and for feature selection and building classification models for  Prakriti respectively. These models were validated in a North Indian population.  Unsupervised clustering led to emergence of three natural clusters corresponding  to three extreme Prakriti classes. The supervised modelling approaches could  classify individuals, with distinct Prakriti types, in the training and  validation sets. This study is the first to demonstrate that Prakriti types are  distinct verifiable clusters within a multidimensional space of multiple  interrelated phenotypic traits.

156,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an immune response of the nasal mucosa to  airborne allergens and involves nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge,  itching of the nose, and sneezing. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may  significantly affect a patient's quality of life and can be associated with  conditions such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, and sleep  disturbances. Various complementary and alternative medicine treatments have  been used for this condition in clinical practice. The Ayurveda system of  medicine is the most common complementary medicine system practiced in Sri  Lanka. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of a  decoction used in traditional Ayurveda for allergic rhinitis and its ready-  to-use freeze dried formulation in comparison to an antihistamine over a period  of 4 weeks on relief of symptoms in allergic rhinitis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a three-arm, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized  controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with AR. Tamalakyadi decoction  containing 12 ingredients (TMD12), used in traditional Ayurveda and its  freeze-dried formulation are the test products. The efficacy and safety of the  two Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the antihistamine loratadine.  Patients with symptoms of AR will be allocated randomly into the three arms  after a 1-week run-in period and the medications will be given orally for  28 days. Total Nasal symptom Score (TNSS) of the patients will be used as the  primary efficacy endpoint. TNSS will be recorded and compared between the three  arms prior to visit 1, at the end of 28 days, and end of the first and second  months of follow-up. Symptom scores of daytime nasal symptoms, night time nasal  symptoms, non-nasal symptoms and health-related quality of life questionnaire  are used as secondary end points. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will be able to provide evidence-based  scientific data on Ayurvedic dosage form, TMD12, and the freeze-dried  formulation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. This trial is expected to  develop capacity to scientifically evaluate various Ayurvedic treatments that  are claimed to have efficacy in treatment of various disease conditions.

The polarity of dry lands  and wet lands framed not only the whole Ayurvedic materia medica, but also the  more general conception of a cosmic physiology governed by Agni (the sun) and  Soma (the dispenser of the rain). Clearing the land and draining the body were  two aspects of one and the same art of managing the transactions of all sorts of  vital fluids, saps, juices, savors and humors.

161,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional knowledge is a particular form of  practice or skill set that was developed in ancient times and was sustained  through generations via the passing of knowledge, essentially confined within a  specific tribe, local people, or family lineages. Ethnodermatological use of  medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if  there is chemical, microbiological, and/or clinical evidence, from a scientific  perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review  can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug  development. AIM OF THE STUDY: We compile and emphasize the most important part of  ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their  applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review  and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the  pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants  against problem skin diseases as well. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different kinds of key phrases such as ""Indian  traditional ethnodermatology"", ""ethnodermatology"", ""ethnobotany"", ""skin  diseases"", ""Ayurveda dermatology"", ""pharmacological activity"" were searched in  online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar  (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/),  PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository  (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained  from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary  shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants' uses have been found  across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities  of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against  particular skin diseases. RESULTS: The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian  subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin  disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is  topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the  pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice,  bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment  remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This  review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the  belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective  therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical  evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may  contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today,  ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new  practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will  further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of  natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand  for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments.

162,"The practice of Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, is based on the  concept of three major constitutional types (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) defined as  ""Prakriti"". To the best of our knowledge, no study has convincingly correlated  genomic variations with the classification of Prakriti. In the present study, we  performed genome-wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis (Affymetrix,  6.0) of 262 well-classified male individuals (after screening 3416 subjects)  belonging to three Prakritis. We found 52 SNPs (p ≤ 1 × 10(-5)) were  significantly different between Prakritis, without any confounding effect of  stratification, after 10(6) permutations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of  these SNPs classified 262 individuals into their respective groups (Vata, Pitta  and Kapha) irrespective of their ancestry, which represent its power in  categorization. We further validated our finding with 297 Indian population  samples with known ancestry. Subsequently, we found that PGM1 correlates with  phenotype of Pitta as described in the ancient text of Caraka Samhita,  suggesting that the phenotypic classification of India's traditional medicine  has a genetic basis; and its Prakriti-based practice in vogue for many centuries  resonates with personalized medicine.",Does the practice of Ayurveda and its classification of Prakriti have a genetic basis?,"So, there's this traditional Indian medicine thing called Ayurveda that's based on body types or something.

166,"Infertility is a universal health problem affecting 15% of couples, out of which  20-30% cases are due to male infertility. The leading causes of male infertility  include hormonal defects, physical reasons, sexual problems, hazardous  environment, stressful lifestyle, genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and  oxidative stress. Various physiological functions involve reactive oxygen  species (ROS) and nitrogen species at appropriate levels for proper smooth  functioning. ROS control critical reproductive processes such as capacitation,  acrosomal reaction, hyperactivation, egg penetration, and sperm head  decondensation. The excessive free radicals or imbalance between ROS and  endogenous antioxidant enzymes damages sperm membrane by inducing lipid  peroxidation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage that eventually  lead to male infertility. Numerous synthetic products are available in the  market to treat infertility problems, largely ending in side effects and  repressing symptoms. Ayurveda contains a particular group of Rasayana herbs,  called vajikarana, that deals with nourishment and stimulation of sexual  tissues, improves male reproductive vitality, and deals with oxidative stress  via antioxidant mechanism.

167,"OBJECTIVES: Clinicians utilise critical research to advance their knowledge when  prescribing standard and alternative therapies for developmental disorders.  Recent research has reported that the traditional Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa  monnieri may improve cognitive outcomes in adult populations; however, few  studies have investigated its benefits in younger cohorts. The aim of the  current review is to systematically assess and critically summarize clinical  trial outcomes and safety of Bacopa and its effects on the cognition and  behaviour in children and adolescents. METHOD: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google and CINAHL were searched up to  August 2015 for trials investigating Bacopa monnieri in child and adolescent  populations. There were no restrictions in study design. Cognitive and  behavioural outcomes were grouped into validated constructs and effect sizes  were calculated for all significant data to allow for direct comparisons. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria for this review. The results  demonstrated significant consistent improvements in the language behaviour  cognitive domain and in a number of the memory sub-domains. Significant  improvements were also seen in hyperactivity and attention-deficit domains.  Overall outcome data demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (mean d=0.42).  Safety and tolerability data was well reported for 80% of studies with only 2.3%  of all participants reporting mild side-effects. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the safe use of Bacopa monnieri in child and  adolescent populations for improving elements of cognition as well as behaviour  and attention-deficit domains.

168,Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient and traditional system of health care. It is  safe but inadvert and unsupervised use can lead to serious health complications.  Lead is a common constituent of these medicines. Here authors describe two cases  of lead encephalopathy as a result of long-term ayurvedic medication intake.  First case was a 54-year-old female taking ayurvedic medications since long time  presented with acute confusional state and memory disturbances with abdominal  pain. MRI brain showed symmetric basal ganglia and cortical signal changes and  edema with significantly elevated lead levels in blood. She responded to  chelation therapy with oral penicillamine with complete clinical and  radiological resolution. Second case presented was a 45-year female taking  ayurvedic medications for hypertension presented with headaches and rapid  deterioration in sensorium leading to coma and death. MRI brain showed diffuse  cerebral edema with basal ganglia signal changes with elevated lead levels in  blood.

169,"Ayurveda is one of the ancient systems of medicine which is widely practised as  a personalized scientific approach towards the general wellness. Ayurvedic  prakriti is broadly defined as the phenotypes which are determined on the basis  of physical, psychological and physiological traits irrespective of their  social, ethnic, dietary and geographical stature. Prakriti is the constitution  of a person, which comprises vata, pitta, and kapha and is a key determinant of  how one individual is different from the other. Human microbiome is considered  the 'latest discovered' human organ and microbiome research reiterates the  fundamental principles of Ayurveda for creating a healthy gut environment by  maintaining the individual-specific microbiome. Hence, it is important to  understand the association of human microbiome with the Ayurvedic prakriti of an  individual. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of human microbiome from  the gut, oral and skin samples of healthy individuals (n=18) by 16S rRNA  gene-based metagenomics using standard QIIME pipeline. In the three different  prakriti samples differential abundance of Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio,  Parabacteroides, Slackia, and Succinivibrio was observed in the gut microbiome.  Analysis also revealed prakriti-specific presence of Mogibacterium,  Propionibacterium, Pyramidobacter, Rhodococcus in the kapha prakriti individuals  Planomicrobium, Hyphomicrobium, Novosphingobium in the pitta prakriti  individuals and Carnobacterium, Robiginitalea, Cetobacterium, Psychrobacter in  the vata prakriti individuals. Similarly, the oral and skin microbiome also  revealed presence of prakriti-specific differential abundance of diverse  bacterial genera. Prakriti-specific presence of bacterial taxa was recorded and  only 42% microbiome in the oral samples and 52% microbiome in the skin samples  were shared. Bacteria known for preventing gut inflammation by digesting the  resistant starch were abundant in the pitta prakriti individuals, who are more  prone to develop gut-inflammation-related disorders. In summary, human gut, oral  and skin microbiome showed presence or high abundance of few bacterial taxa  across three prakriti types, suggesting their specific physiological importance.","How does our individual Ayurvedic prakriti affect the makeup of our gut, oral, and skin microbiomes?","I've heard a bit about this Ayurveda thing and how it's related to our health.

However, recent studies suggest a  declining trend in the use of the Ayurveda system. This study provides insights  into the reasons for the low utilization of the Ayurveda system at present. The  study findings reveal that low utilization of the Ayurveda system can be  attributed to several factors, including the quick effect of Western medicines,  the perception of being accustomed to Western medicines, a lack of competent  Ayurveda practitioners, the high cost and low quality of Ayurveda medicines, and  the rapidly changing lifestyles of villagers.

173,"INTRODUCTION: Ayurveda takes advantage of the beneficial properties of medicinal  plants. High demands in combination with inadequate availability of botanicals  and a lack of knowledge with respect to their precise identification lead to  adulterations in herbal products. Identification becomes more difficult in  complex herbal formulations. Four different polyherbal formulations have been  analyzed for the present paper. The targeted plants have different  pharmacological properties for various ailments. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the rbcL gene based plant DNA mini-barcode to  identify target and non-target plants in polyherbal formulations by using  high-throughput next generation sequencing. METHODS: Degenerate primers of the selected mini-barcode region have been  identified from the literature. A blend of 30 authentic medicinal plant species  was used to examine the species resolution capacity of the mini-barcode. DNA was  isolated from herbal formulations, an amplicon library was prepared, and  sequencing was performed on an IonS5 system. Data were analyzed using various  bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Analysis of control pooled samples revealed the optimum resolving power  of the DNA mini-barcode. Data analysis of the commercial samples revealed that  only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed  contents. In two formulations, only 10 out of 21 and 11 out of 20 plants were  detected, respectively. Additionally, several non-listed plants were also  detected in these formulations. Two formulations contained >20% reads assigned  to non-target plants. Overall, 21.98% of the reads were assigned to non-target  plants. CONCLUSION: The present study clearly demonstrated the successful application  and potential of meta-barcoding in the quality control of complex herbal  matrices.

174,"BACKGROUND: We report a high-risk case of a coronavirus disease 19  (COVID-19)-positive patient with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM),  hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease (CKD), treated  successfully using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga, along  with government-mandated compulsory modern western medicine (MWM) treatment.  Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment  of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita  and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions  and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities,  along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi,  India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before  seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN,  hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was  resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough,  body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based  on the patient's symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including  Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle  modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga  consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms  within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately [Formula:  see text] relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief  within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar [FBS] and  postprandial blood sugar [PPBS]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days,  and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in  symptoms, the patient's real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the  symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a  significant improvement in blood sugar levels (not under control with modern  medicine) was also achieved. Integrative therapy based on the classical texts of  Ayurveda and Yoga may offer a promising and scalable treatment option for  COVID-19 patients.

175,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shilajit is a multi-component natural occurring  mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine which  originated in India. Its source can be traced to the mountainous regions, where  the hilly tribes first identified its beneficial use. Shilajit is aptly referred  to as 'rasayana'/'rasayanam' in Ayurveda and Siddha literature which means  rejuvenator because it prevents ailment and enhances the quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An attempt has been put forth to review shilajit  pertaining to its origin, synonyms, varieties, physical properties, chemical  constituents, therapeutic properties and important biological properties to  affirm its rasayana property. All relevant information on shilajit was collected  from classical texts including pharmacopoeias, formularies, etc. Moreover,  select doctoral thesis from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Gujarat  Ayurved University, Jamnagar were also scanned. Published papers on shilajit  were collected from important databases for biomedical sciences. Amongst, the  various biological properties of shilajit, antioxidant activity and  immuno-modulatory activity were focused as it is closely related to its rasayana  potential. RESULTS: This review finds that shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations  and twenty-four proprietary drugs for extraneous indications. Even-though, there  is a long history of use of shilajit in traditional Indian materia medica,  shilajit unfortunately lacks scientific evaluation and systematic documentation.  In vivo antioxidant activity of shilajit has been studied at an irrelevant dose  and without using a positive control. The immuno-modulatory activity does not  stand the test of critical assessment and currently may be considered as  unproven. CONCLUSION: Based on the earlier studies, the bioactivity of shilajit lacks  substantial evidence. Nevertheless, further studies are imperative to overcome  the lacuna in establishing the antioxidant property of shilajit and more  specific assays are needed to vouch shilajit as an immuno-modulator which may be  of use to establish its rasayana potential.",What is Shilajit and how is it used in Ayurvedic medicine?,I heard about this stuff called Shilajit that's supposed to be good for your health.

176,"Immune control is associated with nigrostriatal neuroprotection for Parkinson's  disease (PD); though its direct cause and effect relationships have not yet been  realized and modulating the immune system for therapeutic gain has been openly  discussed. While the pathobiology of PD remains in study, neuroinflammation is  thought to speed nigrostriatal degeneration. The neuroinflammatory cascade  associated with PD begins with aggregation of misfolded or post-translationally  modified α-synuclein (α-syn). Such aggregation results in neuronal cell death  and the presence of chronically activated glia (microglia and astroglia),  leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis  factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and enzymes such as  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2). These changes in the glial phenotype can affect the central nervous  system (CNS) microenvironment by producing a pro-inflammatory milieu that speeds  PD pathogenesis. Mucuna pruriens (Mp) is the most popular drug in Ayurveda, the  Indian system of medicine. Several reports have suggested that it possesses  analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-epileptic and anti-microbial  activities. Mp contain L-DOPA and ursolic acid which has an anti-inflammatory  property. There are very few literatures which show the immunomodulatory  activity of Mp in PD, several researchers have tried to work on the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in some other diseases. The results of several  studies show that Mp modulate the immune components like TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-λ,  IL-1β, iNOS and IL-2 in the CNS. It also modulates the activity of the  transcription factor NF-kB which plays an important role in the progression of  the PD. Thus, by altering these cytokines or transcription factors, Mp protects  or prevents the progression of PD.

178,"Ethnographic inquiry into Ayurvedic commodification in Kerala revealed the  prevalence of a distinct regional pharmaceutical market dominated by  physician-manufacturers, oriented towards supplying classical medicines to  Ayurvedic doctors. This stands in sharp contrast to mainstream Ayurveda that is  observed to have undergone biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization. This  paper argues that Kerala's classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market  constitutes an alternative modernity because it provided Kerala Ayurveda with a  different route to modernization impervious to the biomedical regime, as well as  endowing it with the institutional power to safeguard its regional identity.  Although physician-entrepreneurs are its key architects, it is sustained by  value regimes shaped by a unique regional medico-cultural milieu. Even when  industrially produced, classical medicines remain embedded within Ayurveda's  socio-technical network; unlike proprietary drugs sold as individual  product-identities through non-Ayurvedic channels, they travel together as a  pharmacopeia, distributed through exclusive doctor-mediated agencies. This  clinic-centric distribution format is best conceptualized as an open-source  business model as it made low-margin generics viable by packaging them with  therapies and services. Besides ensuring better access and affordability, it  provided resistance to pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property  concentration. By keeping the doctor in the loop, it prevented medicines from  degenerating into de-contextualized commodities; the service component of  Ayurveda therein preserved went on become the unique selling point in the  health-tourism market. The tourism-inspired proliferation of Brand Kerala  eventually triggered a paradigm shift in mainstream Ayurveda - shifting focus  from 'pharmaceuticals' to 'services' and from 'illness' to 'wellness'.  Furthermore, interacting with hybrid Ayurvedas in transnational markets, Kerala  Ayurveda co-produces new alterities countervailing the structurally dominant  biomedical paradigm.",How has the focus on services and wellness in Kerala's Ayurveda practices influenced the approach to health and healing?,"So, Ayurveda is pretty big in Kerala, huh?

Secondary Infertility  is having a close proximity to a disorder Vandhyatwa explained in Ayurvedic  classics, due to a variety of causes. Several Ayurvedic interventions are  advised such as Panchakarma (∼purification therapy) for vitiated Doshas in  female reproductive organs, Snehapana (∼oral intake of medicated oil) followed  by Virechana (∼purgation) to produce quality ovum. Other internal medications  like Phalaghrita, Ashokarishta, Kanchanara guggulu etc. have a probable mode of  action with enhancing the perceptibility of endometrium for implantation.

184,"Shatavari-a famous Ayurveda materia medica used mainly as a tonic for women-is  distributed in health food products all over the world. The Ayurvedic  Pharmacopoeia of India identifies the botanical origin of shatavari as the  tuberous root of Asparagus racemosus. We recently investigated by DNA analysis  the botanical origin of shatavari products on the Japanese market. The results  suggested that their botanical origin was Asparagus; however, species  identification was difficult. In this study, we analyzed steroidal saponins,  including those specific to this plant, in these products and confirmed their  origin as A. racemosus. Next, alkaloid analyses of an authentic A. racemosus  plant and these products were performed, because several papers have reported  the isolation of a pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine alkaloid, asparagamine A, from this  plant. Our results suggest that neither plant material nor products contained  asparagamine A. It has been pointed out that Stemona plants are sometimes  mistaken for shatavari, because their tuberous roots have a similar shape to  that of A. racemosus, and pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine alkaloids are thought to be  Stemona-specific. These data strongly suggest that A. racemosus does not contain  asparagamine A, and that previous isolation of asparagamine A from materials  claimed as originating from A. racemosus was likely caused by misidentification  of Stemona plants as A. racemosus.",What are the health benefits of the Shatavari plant in Ayurvedic medicine?,I've heard about this Shatavari stuff that's supposed to be good for women's health.

188,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a genetically predisposed autoimmune disease mediated  by cytokines released by the activated immune cells. It manifests inflammatory,  scaly red or white silvery flaky skin which may be a fluid-filled lesion with  soreness and itchiness. The prevalence rate of psoriasis is increasing day by  day. Despite having such a high prevalence rate, the treatment of psoriasis is  still limited. Hence, there is a need to rethink the various treatment  strategies available in the allopathic as well as in the alternative systems of  medicine. METHODS: Various bibliographic databases of previously published peer-reviewed  research papers were explored and systematic data culminated in terms of various  treatment strategies used for the management of psoriasis. The prime focus is  given towards modern as well as alternative systems of medicine such as  phototherapy, a combination of phototherapy with pharmacotherapy such as  Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy to treat  psoriasis. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of 161 papers, including both research and  review articles, was carried out to make the article readily understandable. The  pathogenesis including inflammatory mediators and type of psoriasis is discussed  before the treatment strategies to understand the pathophysiology of the  disease. The uniqueness, procedure, advantages, and limitations of conventional,  advanced, and traditional systems of medicine to treat psoriasis are discussed  in detail. Emphasis has also been given towards marine sources such as fish oil,  marine sponges, and algae. CONCLUSION: Although there are many modern and alternative treatment strategies  available to treat psoriasis, none of them have been proven to provide complete  relief to patients. Moreover, they are associated with certain side effects. In  order to overcome them, novel drug delivery systems have been utilized and found  effective; however, their stability and safety become the major impediments  towards their successful positioning. Traditional and alternative treatment  strategies have found to be safe and effective but their use is localized to  certain areas. In a nutshell, to achieve successful treatment of psoriasis,  there is a need to focus on the development of stable and non-toxic novel drug  delivery systems or the promotion of traditional systems to treat psoriasis.",What are some alternative treatments for managing psoriasis?,"I've been struggling with psoriasis for a while now and the usual treatments aren't doing much for me.

191,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased global use  of traditional medicines, including Ayurvedic herbal preparations. Due to their  growing demand, their processed nature, and the complexity of the global supply  chain, there is an increased risk of adulteration in these products. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the use of DNA barcoding  for species identification in herbal supplements on the US market associated  with the Ayurvedic treatment of respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A total of 54 commercial products containing Ayurvedic herbs were  tested with four DNA barcoding regions (i.e., rbcL, matK, ITS2, and mini-ITS2)  using two composite samples per product. Nine categories of herbs were targeted:  amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and  vacha. RESULTS: At least one species was identified in 64.8% of products and the  expected species was detected in 38.9% of products. Undeclared plant species,  including other Ayurvedic herbs, rice, and pepper, were detected in 19 products,  and fungal species were identified in 12 products. The presence of undeclared  plant species may be a result of intentional substitution or contamination  during harvest or processing, while fungal DNA was likely associated with the  plant material or the growing environment. The greatest sequencing success  (42.6-46.3%) was obtained with the matK and rbcL primers. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that a combination of genetic  loci should be used for DNA barcoding of herbal supplements. Due to the  limitations of DNA barcoding in identification of these products, future  research should incorporate chemical characterization techniques.",Is it safe to use Ayurvedic herbs from commercial products for treating respiratory symptoms?,I've been taking some Ayurvedic herb supplements to help with my cold symptoms.

193,"Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of  death globally and hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors  associated with CVD. Due to a growing body of research on side effects and  long-term impacts of conventional CVD treatments, focus is shifting towards  exploring alternative treatment approaches such as Ayurveda. However, because of  a lack of strong scientific evidence, the safety and efficacy profiles of such  interventions have not been well established. The current study aims to conduct  a systematic review and meta-analyses to explore the strength of evidence on  efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic herbs for hypercholesterolemia. Methods:  Literature searches were conducted using databases including Medline, Cochrane  Database, AMED, Embase, AYUSH research portal, and many others. All randomized  controlled trials on individuals with hypercholesterolemia using Ayurvedic herbs  (alone or in combination) with an exposure period of ≥ 3 weeks were included,  with primary outcomes being total cholesterol levels, adverse events, and other  cardiovascular events. The search strategy was determined with the help of the  Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group. Two researchers assessed the  risk of each study individually and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or  consultation with a third researcher. Meta-analysis was conducted using the  inverse variance method and results are presented as forest plots and data  summary tables using Revman v5.3. Results: A systematic review of 32 studies  with 1386 participants found randomized controlled trials of three Ayurvedic  herbs, Allium sativum (garlic), Commiphora mukul (guggulu), and Nigella sativa  (black cumin) on hypercholesterolemia that met inclusion criteria. The average  duration of intervention was 12 weeks. Meta-analysis of the trials showed that  guggulu reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels by 16.78  mg/dL (95% C.I. 13.96 to 2.61; p-value = 0.02) and 18.78 mg/dL (95% C.I. 34.07  to 3.48; p = 0.02), respectively. Garlic reduced LDL-C by 10.37 mg/dL (95% C.I.  -17.58 to -3.16; p-value = 0.005). Black cumin lowered total cholesterol by 9.28  mg/dL (95% C.I. -17.36, to -1.19, p-value = 0.02). Reported adverse side effects  were minimal. Conclusion: There is moderate to high level of evidence from  randomized controlled trials that the Ayurvedic herbs guggulu, garlic, and black  cumin are moderately effective for reducing hypercholesterolemia. In addition,  minimal evidence was found for any side effects associated with these herbs,  positioning them as safe adjuvants to conventional treatments.",What Ayurvedic herbs can help reduce high cholesterol levels?,I've heard that having high cholesterol can lead to heart problems.

194,"BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of major neurodegenerative disorders remains a  healthcare mystery. The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress,  inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular  neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than  2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent  aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of  mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective  nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W.  somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery  systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science  direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha,  neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval  includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed  publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature,  Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera  mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease,  Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and  anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better  neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles,  and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of  neurodegenerative diseases.

196,"Bacopa monniera, Linn. (Brahmi: Scrophulariaceae) an Ayurvedic medicine is  clinically used for memory enhancing, epilepsy, insomnia and as mild sedative.  For the first time the effect of alcohol and hexane fraction of Brahmi has been  studied on FeSO4 and cumene hydroperoxide induced lipid peroxidation. Alcohol  fraction showed greater protection with both inducers. Results were compared  with known antioxidants tris, EDTA and a natural-antioxidant vitamin E. The  effect of Brahmi was also examined on hepatic glutathione content. The mechanism  of action could be through metal chelation at the initiation level and also as  chain breaker. The results suggested that Brahmi is a potent antioxidant. The  response of Brahmi was dose dependent. Tris, an hydroxyl trapper did not show  any protection in comparison to Brahmi where as EDTA and vitamin E did protect  against FeSO4. In experimental conditions 100 micrograms Brahmi extract  (alcoholic) was equivalent to 247 micrograms of EDTA (0.66 microM) and 58  micrograms of vitamin E.

197,"The remarkable biodiversity of medicinal plants worldwide highlights their  significance in traditional and alternative medicine. Astavarga, a group of  eight medicinal herbs from the Himalayan region of India, including Roscoea  purpurea (commonly known as Kakoli), is esteemed in Ayurveda for its  health-promoting and rejuvenating properties. In this comprehensive study, we  aimed to develop and optimise robust UHPLC-MS/QToF (Ultra-high-performance  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with quadrupole time of flight)  and GC-MS/MS (Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) methods to identify  the phytochemicals in R. purpurea root hydromethanolic extract and essential  oil. We also conducted a comparative assessment of supercritical fluid  extraction and conventional solvent extraction methods for the first time in R.  purpurea root, highlighting their relevance to the medicinal field. Using the  UHPLC/MS-QToF method, we identified a total of fifty-six phytometabolites, while  sixteen volatile constituents were discerned within the essential oil of R.  purpurea by GC-MS/MS method. Among the volatile constituents, β-eudesmol  (40.84 %), guaiac acetate (10.55 %), and γ-eudesmol (10.31 %) were emerged as  the principal components. Our findings were further compared with the volatile  constituents extracted via supercritical fluid extraction and conventional  solvent extraction methods. Notably, our research unveiled the presence of a  carotenoid metabolite, 15-methyl retinol, for the first time. Furthermore, our  fatty acid analysis of the supercritical fluid extract revealed elevated levels  of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic and linoleic acids.

199,"BACKGROUND: Good mental condition is a vital part of health. Physical  impairments would potentially have psychiatric manifestations during the course  of a disease that could cause patients to experience a wide range of  psychological conditions. This study was conducted to determine prevalence of  anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological morbidities among the patients  who received warded treatments at Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Teaching  Hospital, Sri Lanka. METHODS: A total of 148 patients admitted to the hospital were selected for the  study on a random systematic basis under four systemic groups (gastrointestinal,  integumentary, musculoskeletal, and nervous system) depending on the chief  complaint. The presence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms was assessed  by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 item version (DASS 21). The General  Linear Model (GLM) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Over 50% of the participants in all four patient groups belonged to age  group of 35 to 65 years, encompassing the fraction of population that actively  contribute to the workforce in the society. Stress, anxiety, and depression  values of patients belonging to different complications varied significantly, as  indicated by GLM (p < 0.05). Patients diagnosed with integumentary  system-related issues denoted the highest stress levels (27.7 ± 2.54), while the  mean stress values among the other systemic groups were not significantly  different among each other. The highest anxiety levels were indicated by  patients with nervous system-related issues (18.6 ± 1.51), while the lowest  anxiety levels were indicated by patients with integumentary disorders  (6.0 ± 2.73). The highest depression level was identified from patients  suffering from integumentary system-related disorders (31.7 ± 3.42), followed by  nervous system (23.2 ± 1.78), gastrointestinal (19.5 ± 3.77), and  musculoskeletal (16.8 ± 1.57) disorders. CONCLUSION: Overall, high distress levels were observed among the majority of  the patients. Furthermore, integumentary issues may lead to significant  psychological impacts. As most of the patients seek for Ayurveda treatments when  their diseased condition becomes chronic, it is vital to focus on a  biopsychosocial approach to patient assessment and patient care, in actual  practice.",How can Ayurveda treatment help with managing psychological stress related to physical illnesses?,"I've noticed that I've been feeling a lot of stress and anxiety lately, could this be linked to my chronic skin condition?","I've been feeling a bit down and stressed lately, especially since I've been having some skin issues.

201,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that originated in  ancient India, and it is still in practice. Medicinal plants are the backbone of  Ayurveda, which heavily relies on the plant-derived therapeutics. While Ayurveda  is becoming more popular in several countries throughout the World, lack of  authenticated medicinal plant raw drugs is a growing concern. Our aim was to DNA  barcode the medicinal plants that are listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of  India (API) to create a reference DNA barcode library, and to use the same to  authenticate the raw drugs that are sold in markets. METHODS: We have DNA barcoded 347 medicinal plants using rbcL marker, and  curated rbcL DNA barcodes for 27 medicinal plants from public databases. These  sequences were used to create Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA  Barcode Library (API-RDBL). This library was used to authenticate 100 medicinal  plant raw drugs, which were in the form of powders (82) and seeds (18). RESULTS: Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA Barcode Library  (API-RDBL) was created with high quality and authentic rbcL barcodes for 374 out  of the 395 medicinal plants that are included in the API. The rbcL DNA barcode  differentiated 319 species (85 %) with the pairwise divergence ranging between  0.2 and 29.9 %. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing success rate of rbcL marker  was 100 % even for the poorly preserved medicinal plant raw drugs that were  collected from local markets. DNA barcoding revealed that only 79 % raw drugs  were authentic, and the remaining 21 % samples were adulterated. Further,  adulteration was found to be much higher with powders (ca. 25 %) when compared  to seeds (ca. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the utility of DNA barcoding in  authenticating medicinal plant raw drugs, and found that approximately one fifth  of the market samples were adulterated. Powdered raw drugs, which are very  difficult to be identified by taxonomists as well as common people, seem to be  the easy target for adulteration. Developing a quality control protocol for  medicinal plant raw drugs by incorporating DNA barcoding as a component is  essential to ensure safety to the consumers.",How can I ensure the Ayurvedic medicinal plants I purchase are authentic and not adulterated?,I've been using some Ayurvedic powders for my health recently. How can I make sure what I'm buying is actually legit and not just some fake stuff?,I've heard about Ayurvedic medicine but I'm worried about fake products.

202,"BACKGROUND: The roots of Argyreia speciosa (Linn. F) Sweet (family:  Convolvulaceae) are used in Ayurveda to treat male reproductive and nervous  system disorders. OBJECTIVE: Isolation of scopoletin from the roots of Argyreia speciosa, and  development and validation of an analytical method using HPLC for the  quantification of scopoletin from the root powder of Argyreia speciosa. METHOD: Scopoletin was isolated from chloroform fraction prepared from  hydrolyzed methanolic extract and identified using spectral studies. A  reverse-phase HPLC-based analytical method was developed and optimized using the  Design of Experiment (DoE) approach to estimate scopoletin from the roots of  Argyreia speciosa. Scopoletin was separated and quantified using HPLC containing  the C18 column and a PDA detector. The optimized mobile phase was methanol:  water (pH∼3.2) [25: 75, %v/v]. RESULTS: The Box-Behnken design was used to optimize chromatographic parameters  and the extraction procedure. The validation studies showed a linear  relationship (r2=0.998) in the range of 1-40 µg/mL. The LOD and LOQ were found  to be 0.28 µg/mL and 0.84 µg/mL, respectively, and the recovery values were  found to be between 91.94 and 97.86%. The developed analytical method was found  to be robust as well. The amount of scopoletin was estimated to be  0.024 ± 0.0016%w/w from dried root powder. CONCLUSION: The recorded chromatogram and amount of scopoletin determined would  serve as one of the standardization parameters to access the quality of raw  material containing Argyreia speciosa. HIGHLIGHTS: Developed analytical method may be adopted as a part of the  standardization procedure for Argyreia speciosa in the quality control  laboratory.",Can the roots of Argyreia speciosa be used to treat male reproductive or nervous system disorders in Ayurvedic medicine?,I've heard about this plant called Argyreia speciosa being used in Ayurveda.

203,"The World Health Organization (WHO) Traditional Medicine Strategy (2014-2023)  aimed to help member states promote the safe and effective use of traditional  medicine. While economic conditions have markedly improved in Bangladesh, the  country is experiencing significant public health problems. Because of limited  medical resources, there is a strong incentive to enhance complementary and  alternative medicine usage in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to confirm  the perceptions and attitudes of medical doctors (MDs) in Dhaka, Bangladesh,  with regard to Ayurvedic medicine (AM). A total number of 159 MDs in Dhaka were  interviewed by face-to-face between February and June 2015. The study revealed  that 62.0% of MDs had treated patients with AM and 55.3% believed that AM should  be regarded as its own specialty, whereas 39.7% of MDs believed that AM should  be part of the conventional medical curriculum and 32.7% thought that AM did not  seem scientific. In terms of gender, 45.3% of male MDs agreed or strongly agreed  that AM only had a placebo effect. On the other hand, 65.8% of female MDs  disagreed or strongly disagreed it. In terms of age, 77.0% of MDs aged 36 or  elder (elder MDs) believed they were more likely to recommend AM use and 80.3%  of elder MDs believed that the government should encourage more initiatives to  promote AM.

208,"Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) is used in Indian traditional medicine,  Ayurveda, and is believed to have a variety of health-promoting effects. The  molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying these effects have not yet been  sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of Ashwagandha  extracts and their major withanolides (withaferin A and withanone) on muscle  cell differentiation using C2C12 myoblasts. We found that withaferin A and  withanone and Ashwagandha extracts possessing different ratios of these active  ingredients have different effects on the differentiation of C2C12. Withanone  and withanone-rich extracts caused stronger differentiation of myoblasts to  myotubes, deaggregation of heat- and metal-stress-induced aggregated proteins,  and activation of hypoxia and autophagy pathways.

211,"INTRODUCTION: A number of traditional systems of medicine exist in India of  which Ayurveda is the most popular. Despite being in use for more than 3000  years, few properly designed trials have scientifically examined the clinical  potential of Ayurvedic and other medications. METHODS: We reviewed the MEDLINE database to identify clinical trials conducted  using traditional Indian medicines. Single case reports were excluded. RESULTS: Ayurvedic preparations have been successfully used for the treatment of  bronchial asthma, ischaemic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia. Formulations  containing curcumin were reported to reduce inflammation and disability in  double-blind clinical trials on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A number of  products are reported to be useful in patients with acute viral hepatitis. A  multicentric study by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed that a  preparation from Pterocarpus marsupium was effective in reducing levels of blood  glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin in patients with non-insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus. In another multicentric trial, patients with fistula-in-ano  were randomised to surgery or application of medicated seton (Ksharsootra).  Surgical treatment led to a faster cure but recurrence rates were lower with  medicated seton. Administration of extract from Bacopa monnieri, to children  with mental retardation, was reported to significantly improve short-term and  long-term memory. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based studies on the efficacy and safety of traditional  Indian medicines are limited. The essential ingredient in most formulations is  not precisely defined. High quality studies are necessary to evaluate and  compare the value of traditional Indian drugs to modern medicine.",What Ayurvedic treatments are available for managing asthma or heart disease?,I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine lately.

212,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize Ayurvedic perspectives on the etiopathogenesis and  supportive treatments for a biomedical diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: Hour-long, digitally recorded interviews were conducted with 10  experienced Ayurvedic clinicians, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using  techniques of qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified. The Ayurvedic description of the  pathophysiology of cancer uses traditional concepts translated into a modern  context. Although the biomedical treatment of cancer is considered valuable,  from an Ayurvedic perspective it results in degeneration and depletion. In cases  where biomedical treatment of cancer is not feasible, an Ayurvedic approach  focusing on strengthening digestion, eliminating toxins, reducing tumor growth,  and improving tissue metabolism is useful. An Ayurvedic approach to cancer  supportive care focuses on restoring equilibrium, building strength, and  rejuvenation.

213,"BACKGROUND: Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems  since 1000 BC. OBJECTIVES: To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for  schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register  (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified  studies and contacted the first author of each included study. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all clinical randomised trials comparing  Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic  drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently extracted data and calculated  random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where  appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat  basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were  unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as  global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic  herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early  (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly  equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic  assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to  12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating  1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga  group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared  with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study  early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people  allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared  to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea  and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09  to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a  complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill  people with schizophrenia, it is equally ( 10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13  to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group.

214,"SARS-CoV 2 is a novel virus strain of Coronavirus, reported in China in late  December 2019. Its highly contagious nature in humans has prompted WHO to  designate the ongoing pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of International  Concern. At this moment, there is no specific treatment and the therapeutic  strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, with prevention aimed  at reducing community transmission. A permanent solution for the pandemic, which  has brought the world economy to the edge of collapse, is the need of the hour.  This situation has brought intense research in traditional systems of medicine.  Indian Traditional System, Ayurveda, has a clear concept of the cause and  treatment of pandemics. Through this review, information on the potential  antiviral traditional medicines along with their immunomodulatory pathways are  discussed. We have covered the seven most important Indian traditional plants  with antiviral properties: Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (family: Solanaceae),  Tinospora cordifolia (Thunb.)

215,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine describes a  unique concept ""prakriti"", genetically determined, categorising the population  into several subgroups based on phenotypic characters like appearance,  temperament and habits. The concept is claimed to be useful in predicting an  individual's susceptibility to a particular disease, prognosis of that illness  and selection of therapy. The present study was carried out to study if the  platelet aggregatory response and its inhibition by aspirin varied in the  different prakriti subtypes. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee permission, normal  healthy individuals of either sex between the age group 18 to 30 years were  recruited in the study. Their prakriti evaluation was done using a standardized  validated questionnaire (TNMC Prakriti 2004). Their Platelet Rich Plasma was  incubated with either aspirin [2.5 micro-mole (μM) and 5 μM] or distilled water  as control for three minutes after which the aggregatory response to 5 μM  Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) was measured over a period of 7 minutes. RESULTS: We observed that in the study population of normal healthy participants  (n= 137), ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) was highest among the  Vata-pitta prakriti individuals [Median (range), 83.33% (52.33-96)] as compared  to the other prakriti types and these individuals responded better to lower dose  of aspirin compared to other prakriti types. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that identifying the prakriti may help in  individualising therapy or predicting proneness to a disease.",Can knowing my prakriti type in Ayurveda help to personalize my treatment or predict susceptibility to certain diseases?,"So, in this traditional Indian medicine system called Ayurveda, people have different ""prakriti"" types that affect health and stuff.

217,"Background Herbal medicines have been used in the treatment of liver diseases  for a long time. In recent years, the use of herbal medicines for protection  from other strong antibiotics as well as drugs that can damage the liver during  their metabolism in liver and for treatment of liver diseases has increased all  over the world. It is important to mention that a number of organic solvents are  used at different stages of extraction/formulation development for these  traditional preparations in industries/pharmacies. In addition, some of these  solvents possess established carcinogenic properties and may enter the  formulation as residual solvents. Hence as per ICH guidelines it is mandatory to  keep the level of these solvents up to permissible limits. There has been a lot  of hue and cry that ayurvedic formulations available in the market are not  properly standardized for their quality due to lack of stringent regulations and  standards from regulatory authorities. Therefore the aim of present work was to  assess the compliance of ICH guidelines for level of organic volatile impurities  in common marketed ayurvedic hepatic formulations. Methods In this study, 25  ayurvedic herbal formulations available as OTC product have been assessed for  presence of residual solvents using gas chromatography with flame ionization  detector. Results This study on 25 fast moving hepatic formulations in the  market reflects that no residual solvents were detected in any of the  formulations however if present were within prescribed permissible limits of ICH  guidelines. The data was also subjected to statistical analysis (F-test and  t-test at 95% confidence level).

218,"Psychodermatology, a relatively neglected branch of dermatology in India, refers  to a holistic approach to skin diseases involving not only the mind and skin,  but also the cutaneous effects of psychologic stress. Among many Indian people,  culture, religion, the belief in karma, and the tendency to prefer indigenous  medical systems can all have a major impact on lifestyle, as well as the  approach to managing various diseases, including dermatologic conditions. The  origin of psychodermatology in India can be traced to Buddha's period.  Indigenous medical systems, such as Ayurveda, Yoga, and Unani, advocate control  of skin disease through meditation, exercises, and related practices. Scientific  practice of psychodermatology is still lacking in India, although there is an  increasing understanding of the mind-skin connection among both health care  providers and patients who have access to information over the Internet. The  first dedicated psychodermatology liaison clinic was established in 2010 in  Manipal, India. The common problems encountered have been anxiety, dysthymia,  and depression, especially in patients with psoriasis, vitiligo, and urticaria.","What are some ways to manage skin conditions like psoriasis, vitiligo, and urticaria through practices like meditation and exercise?",I've been really stressed lately and I've noticed it's freaking out my skin.

221,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chyawanprash (CP), a traditional immune booster  recipe, has a long history of ethnic origin, development, household preparation  and usage. There are even mythological stories about the origin of this recipe  including its nomenclature. In the last six decades, CP, because of  entrepreneurial actions of some research Vaidyas (traditional doctors) has grown  to industrial production and marketing in packed forms to a large number of  consumers/patients like any food or health care product. Currently, CP has  acquired a large accepted user base in India and in a few countries out-side  India. AIM OF THE STUDY: Authoritative texts, recognized by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act  of India, describe CP as an immunity enhancer and strength giver meant for  improving lung functions in diseases with compromised immunity. This review  focuses on published clinical efficacy and safety studies of CP for correlation  with health benefits as documented in the authoritative texts, and also briefs  on its recipes and processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authoritative texts were searched for recipes, processes,  and other technical details of CP. Labels of marketing CP products (Indian) were  studied for the health claims. Electronic search for studies of CP on efficacy  and safety data were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE and DHARA (Digital Helpline for  Ayurveda Research Articles), and Ayurvedic books were also searched for clinical  studies. RESULTS: The documented clinical studies from electronic databases and Ayurvedic  books evidenced that individuals who consume CP regularly for a definite period  of time showed improvement in overall health status and immunity. However, most  of the clinical studies in this review are of smaller sample size and short  duration. Further, limitation to access and review significant data on  traditional products like CP in electronic databases was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials of high quality with larger sample  size and longer follow-up are needed to have significant evidence on the  clinical use of CP as immunity booster. Additional studies involving measurement  of current biomarkers of immunity pre- and post-consumption of the product as  well as benefits accruing with the use of CP as an adjuvant are suggested.",What are some benefits of regularly consuming Chyawanprash for my overall health and immunity?,I've been hearing a lot about this Chyawanprash stuff.

222,"Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word, which means ""the scripture for longevity"". It  represents an ancient system of traditional medicine prevalent in India and in  several other south Asian countries. It is based on a holistic view of treatment  which is believed to cure human diseases through establishment of equilibrium in  the different elements of human life, the body, the mind, the intellect and the  soul [1]. Ayurveda dates back to the period of the Indus Valley civilization  (about 3000 B.C) and has been passed on through generations of oral tradition,  like the other four sacred texts (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and  Atharvanaveda) which were composed between 12(th) and 7(th) century B.C [2, 3].  References to the herbal medicines of Ayurveda are found in all of the other  four Vedas, suggesting that Ayurveda predates the other Vedas by at least  several centuries. It was already in full practice at the time of Buddha (6(th)  century B.C) and had produced two of the greatest physicians of ancient India,  Charaka and Shushrutha who composed the basic texts of their trade, the  Samhitas. By this time, ayurveda had already developed eight different  subspecialties of medical treatment, named Ashtanga, which included surgery,  internal medicine, ENT, pediatrics, toxicology, health and longevity, and  spiritual healing [4]. Ayurvedic medicine was mainly composed of herbal  preparations which were occasionally combined with different levels of other  compounds, as supplements [5]. In the Ayurvedic system, the herbs used for  medicinal purposes are classed as brain tonics or rejuvenators. Among the plants  most often used in Ayurveda are, in the descending order of importance: (a)  Ashwagandha, (b) Brahmi, (c) Jatamansi, (d) Jyotishmati, (e) Mandukparni, (f)  Shankhapushpi, and (g) Vacha. The general appearance of these seven plants is  shown in Fig.1. Their corresponding Latin names, as employed in current  scientific literature, the botanical families that each of them belongs to,  their normal habitats in different areas of the world, as well as the common  synonyms by which they are known, are shown in the Table 1. The scientific  investigations concerning the best known and most scientifically investigated of  these herbs, Ashwagandha will be discussed in detail in this review. Ashwagandha  (Withania somnifera, WS), also commonly known, in different parts of the world,  as Indian ginseng, Winter cherry, Ajagandha, Kanaje Hindi and Samm Al Ferakh, is  a plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is also known in different  linguistic areas in India by its local vernacular names [6]. It grows  prolifically in dry regions of South Asia, Central Asia and Africa, particularly  in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, South Africa, Egypt,  Morocco, Congo and Jordon [7]. In India, it is cultivated, on a commercial  scale, in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and  Rajasthan [6]. In Sanskrit, ashwagandha, the Indian name for WS, means ""odor of  the horse"", probably originating from the odor of its root which resembles that  of a sweaty horse. The name""somnifera"" in Latin means ""sleep-inducer"" which  probably refers to its extensive use as a remedy against stress from a variety  of daily chores. Some herbalists refer to ashwagandha as Indian ginseng, since  it is used in India, in a way similar to how ginseng is used in traditional  Chinese medicine to treat a large variety of human diseases [8]. Ashwagandha is  a shrub whose various parts (berries, leaves and roots) have been used by  Ayurvedic practitioners as folk remedies, or as aphrodisiacs and diuretics. The  fresh roots are sometimes boiled in milk, in order to leach out undesirable  constituents. The berries are sometimes used as a substitute to coagulate milk  in cheese making. In Ayurveda, the herbal preparation is referred to as a  ""rasayana"", an elixir that works, in a nonspecific, global fashion, to increase  human health and longevity. It is also considered an adaptogen, a nontoxic  medication that normalizes physiological functions, disturbed by chronic stress,  through correction of imbalances in the neuroendocrine and immune systems [9,  10]. The scientific research that has been carried out on Ashwagandha and other  ayurvedic herbal medicines may be classified into three major categories, taking  into consideration the endogenous or exogenous phenomena that are known to cause  physiological disequilibrium leading to the pathological state; (A)  pharmacological and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or  multi-herbal mixtures on specific non-neurological diseases; (B) pharmacological  and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or multi-herbal mixtures  on neurodegenerative disorders; and (C) biochemical, physiological and genetic  studies on the herbal plants themselves, in order to distinguish between those  originating from different habitats, or to improve the known medicinal quality  of the indigenous plant. Some of the major points on its use in the treatment of  neurodegenerative disorders are described below.",What are some of the main herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine and what are their benefits?,I've been hearing about this Ayurveda stuff a lot lately. Can it actually help improve my overall health and reduce stress?,What is this Ashwagandha herb I've heard about and how might it help improve my overall health and longevity?
223,"PURPOSE: The overarching objective of this investigation was to investigate the  intervention of green nanotechnology to transform the ancient holistic Ayurvedic  medicine scientifically credible through reproducible formulations and rigorous  pre-clinical/clinical evaluations. METHODS: We provide, herein, full details: (i) on the discovery and full  characterization of gold nanoparticles-based Nano Swarna Bhasma (henceforth  referred to as NSB drug); (ii) In vitro anti-tumor properties of NSB drug in  breast tumor cells; (iii) pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy studies of NSB drug  in breast tumor bearing SCID mice through oral delivery protocols and (iv) first  results of clinical translation, from mice to human breast cancer patients,  through pilot human clinical trials, conducted according to the Ayurveda, Yoga  and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (abbreviated as AYUSH) regulatory  guidelines of the Government of India in metastatic breast cancer patients. RESULTS: The preclinical in vitro and in vivo investigations, in breast tumor  bearing mice, established unequivocally that the NSB Nano-Ayurvedic  medicine-gold nanoparticles-based drug is highly effective in controlling the  growth of breast tumors in a dose dependent fashion in vivo. These encouraging  pre-clinical results prompted us to seek permission from the Indian Government's  holistic medicine approval authority, AYUSH, for conducting clinical trials in  human patients. Patients treated with the NSB drug capsules along with the  ""standard of care treatment"" (Arm B) exhibited 100% clinical benefits when  compared to patients in the treatment Arm A, thus indicating the tremendous  clinical benefits of NSB drug in adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: We have succeeded in clinically translating, from mice to humans, in  using proprietary combinations of gold nanoparticles and phytochemicals to  develop the Nano-Ayurvedic drug: Nano Swarna Bhasma (NSB), through innovative  green nanotechnology, for treating human metastatic breast cancer patients.","Can Ayurvedic medicine, such as Nano Swarna Bhasma, be effective in treating breast cancer?","I've heard about this new Ayurvedic thing called Nano Swarna Bhasma, apparently it's supposed to help with breast cancer treatment.

224,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng, is a  highly traded medicinal plant, which is used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani  systems of medicine to improve cognitive function, decrease inflammation, and to  counter the ill-effects of aging. Withanolide A and Withaferin A from  Ashwagandha were shown to improve immunity and have anti-cancer property,  respectively. AIM OF THE STUDY: Here, we aimed to create reference DNA barcodes for  W. somnifera and to authenticate root and powder samples of Ashwagandha  collected from markets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three plant specimen of W. somnifera were collected, and  reference DNA barcodes were generated using rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2 DNA  barcode markers. Market samples in the form of root (n = 33) and powder (n = 70)  were collected and authenticated using ITS2 and trnH-psbA DNA barcodes. RESULTS: Genomic DNA was successfully isolated from all plant specimens and  market samples. DNA barcoding showed that 77% of samples were authentic. About  22% of non-authentic samples were powder samples and only 1% were root samples.  Among the non-authentic samples, 18% were completely substituted with single  species (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., or Senna  auriculata (L.) Roxb.) and 82% were mixed samples containing more than one  species. About 63% of the mixed samples contained Ashwagandha as the major  ingredient. Furthermore, we identified that six taxonomically divergent plant  species from four families were present as adulterants in the mixed samples. CONCLUSION: DNA barcoding revealed that botanical adulteration in the market  samples of Ashwagandha is significant. Powder samples are more prone to  adulteration than root samples. The adulterated samples contained plant material  that is not related to Ashwagandha, which warrants strict quantity control and  market surveillance to derive the true medicinal benefits of this medicinal  plant.",How can I ensure that the Ashwagandha powder I'm buying is authentic and not adulterated?,I've been hearing about this Ashwagandha stuff and its health benefits.

225,"The history of Cannabis goes along that of humankind, as speculated based on  geographical and evolutionary models together with historic data collected to  date. Its medical use is several thousand years old, as attested both by  archeobotanical evidence of Cannabis remains and written records found in  ancient texts from the sacred Vedic foundational texts of Ayurvedic medicine  (about 800 before current era [BCE]) to the first known Pharmacopoea, the  Chinese ""Shen Nung Pen Ts'ao Ching"" (1 century BCE). In this paper, we retrace  the history of Cannabis traveling through the key stages of its diffusion among  the most important ancient cultures up to our days, when we are facing a  renaissance of its medical employment.

229,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the past years, the treatment of rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) has undergone remarkable changes in all therapeutic modes. The  present newfangled care in clinical research is to determine and to pick a new  track for better treatment options for RA. Recent ethnopharmacological  investigations revealed that traditional herbal remedies are the most preferred  modality of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, several  ayurvedic modes of treatments and formulations for RA are not much studied and  documented from Indian traditional system of medicine. Therefore, this directed  us to develop an integrated database, RAACFDb (acronym: Rheumatoid Arthritis  Ayurvedic Classical Formulations Database) by consolidating data from the  repository of Vedic Samhita - The Ayurveda to retrieve the available  formulations information easily. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature data was gathered using several search engines  and from ayurvedic practitioners for loading information in the database. In  order to represent the collected information about classical ayurvedic  formulations, an integrated database is constructed and implemented on a MySQL  and PHP back-end. RESULTS: The database is supported by describing all the ayurvedic classical  formulations for the treatment rheumatoid arthritis. It includes composition,  usage, plant parts used, active ingredients present in the composition and their  structures. CONCLUSION: The prime objective is to locate ayurvedic formulations proven to be  quite successful and highly effective among the patients with reduced side  effects.

230,"Asparagus racemosus Willd. (Asparagaceae) is an important medicinal plant of  tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the  Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as  Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Asparagus racemosus is mainly known for its  phytoestrogenic properties. With an increasing realization that hormone  replacement therapy with synthetic oestrogens is neither as safe nor as  effective as previously envisaged, the interest in plant-derived oestrogens has  increased tremendously making Asparagus racemosus particularly important. The  plant has been shown to aid in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and  in alcohol abstinence-induced withdrawal symptoms. In Ayurveda, Asparagus  racemosus has been described as a rasayana herb and has been used extensively as  an adaptogen to increase the non-specific resistance of organisms against a  variety of stresses. Besides use in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery,  the plant also has potent antioxidant, immunostimulant, anti-dyspepsia and  antitussive effects. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus  racemosus is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and  inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction in the  form of deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered  'endangered' in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of  this plant is crucial. This article aims to evaluate the biological activities,  pharmacological applications and clinical studies of Asparagus racemosus in an  attempt to provide a direction for further research. Keeping in mind the fact  that it is the active principle that imparts medicinal value to a plant;  consistency in quality and quantity needs to be maintained to ensure uniform  drug efficacy. Also, deliberate or inadvertent adulteration needs to be dealt  with at an early stage. To overcome these prevalent problems, the availability  of genetically superior and uniform planting material is essential. This can be  obtained by a combination of various biotechnological tools involving  chemoprofiling, tissue culture and use of molecular markers. Along with the  application of these methods, proper agro-techniques and adequate marketing  opportunities would encourage cultivation of Asparagus racemosus and thereby  contribute to its conservation. There are also several gaps in the existing  literature with regard to the pharmacological actions of Asparagus racemosus.  These include an incomplete understanding about the interaction/synergy between  Asparagus racemosus and other plant constituents in polyherbal formulations;  lack of information regarding the mode of action of the various constituents of  Asparagus racemosus, etc. Consequently, we have suggested a 'systems biology'  approach that includes metabolite profiling, metabolic fingerprinting,  metabolite target analysis and metabonomics to enable further research.",What are some health benefits of the Asparagus racemosus plant in traditional medicine?,I've been feeling super stressed and my friend mentioned something about adaptogens helping out.

231,"BACKGROUND: Body composition and types are often considered essential health  indicators for lifestyle-related disease. Assessment of body type based on  tridosha is regarded as a prerequisite in Ayurveda. AIM: To correlate body compositions and somatotypes with Prakriti body types. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 463 adult individuals was done.  Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured. Heath-Carter  somatotypes and Prakriti body types were also determined. Tests of association  were calculated. Correlation and concordance analysis was also done to infer the  correlation between body composition parameters and Prakriti body types. RESULTS: Kapha Prakriti have significantly higher body weight, body mass index  (BMI), body fat percentage and body fat mass. Vata have the lowest mean values  in all body composition parameters with Pitta in the intermediate position  compared to the other Prakriti types. There is a strong and positive statistical  association between Prakriti body types and body composition parameters, except  height. Cohen's Kappa analysis reveals there is a fair concordance between  Prakriti body types and somatotype. CONCLUSIONS: Prakriti assessment can explain an individual's fatness as it  correlates with body composition parameters and could be used to predict risk  susceptibility to various complex disorders.",Can my Ayurvedic body type (Prakriti) indicate my risk for certain health disorders?,I've been hearing about this Ayurvedic concept of body types called Prakriti.

238,"Background: The advancing etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of the  global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have prompted the medical  community to consider Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani as add-on preventive and  therapeutic options. Objective: To explore the effect of standalone or  integrative Traditional Formulations (TFs) on selected clinical symptoms and  biomarkers of COVID-19. Search strategy: Out of 465 articles identified from  PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with  1646 COVID-19 patients published from January 2020 to February 2022 were  included in the study. Inclusion criteria: RCTs that compared the effect of  standalone/integrative TFs in decoction, tablet, and powder forms with placebo  plus standard care (SC)/placebo/SC as controls involving mild to severe  symptomatic COVID-19 patients were included. Data extraction and analysis: Three  reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of each article based  on the inclusion after deleting duplicates. The relevant full texts were  retrieved and examined, and then their data were extracted and double-checked by  three independent reviewers using prepared data extraction forms. The primary  outcome variables were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, fever,  cough, dyspnea, myalgia, headache, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte  sedimentation rate (ESR), and D-dimer. Results: The effect of different TFs or  integrative TFs was more to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) than the controls. There was an increase in fever and  cough, a decrease in dyspnea, myalgia, headache, and ESR, no change in CRP, and  a slight increase in D-dimer as an effect of TFs. Conclusions: Integrative or  standalone TF may be the inexpensive preventive and therapeutic option to  inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and its clinical symptoms.","Can traditional formulations like Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani help in treating or preventing COVID-19 symptoms?",I've been hearing about these traditional remedies for COVID-19 symptoms.

244,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sarasvata ghrita (SG), a polyherbal formulation  from ayurveda, an ancient medicinal system of India, has been used to improve  intelligence and memory, treat speech delay, speaking difficulties and low  digestion power in children. AIM OF THE STUDY: Study aimed to validate the ethno use of SG in memory  enhancement through systematic scientific protocol. The effect of SG and modern  extracts of ingredients of SG was compared on cognitive function and  neuroprotection in amyloid-β peptide 25-35(Aβ25-35) induced memory impairment in  wistar rats. Further the underlying mechanism for neuroprotective activity was  investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SG was prepared as per traditional method, ethanolic  extract (EE) was prepared by conventional method and lipid based extract was  prepared by modern extraction method. All extracts were standardised by newly  developed HPLC method with respect to marker compounds. SG, EE and LE were  administered orally to male Wistar rats at doses of 100,200 and 400 mg/kg Body  Weight by feeding needle for a period of 21 days after the  intracerebroventricular administration of Aβ25-35 bilaterally. Spatial memory of  rats was tested using Morris water maze (MWM) and Radial arm maze (RAM) test.  The possible underlying mechanisms for the cognitive improvement exhibited by  SG, EE and LE was investigated through ex-vivo brain antioxidant effect,  monoamine level estimation, acetylcholine esterase (AchE) inhibitory effect and  Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels estimation. RESULTS: SG, EE and LE were analyzed by HPLC method, results showed that EE  extract has high percent of selected phytoconstituents as compared with SG and  LE. SG and LE decrease escape latency and searching distance in a dose dependant  manner during MWM test. In case of RAM significant decrease in number of errors  and increase in number of correct choices indicate an elevation in retention and  recall aspects of learning and memory after administration of SG an LE. SG and  LE extract can efficiently prevent accumulation of β-amyloid plaque in  hippocampus region. There was increase in SOD, GSH, CAT and NO level and  decrease in MDA levels in SG and LE administered animals. SG and LE have found  to exhibit AchE inhibitiory activity and significant dose-dependant increase in  BDNF level in the plasma. SG and LE significantly increased the levels of  noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain. CONCLUSION: The study validated the neuroprotective activity of SG. The study  concludes the extraction efficiency of SG for selected phytoconstituents is less  than modern methods. However the neuroprotective activity of SG and LE was found  to be greater than EE.",Can the Ayurvedic formulation Sarasvata ghrita help improve memory and cognitive function?,"I've been having trouble remembering stuff lately, is there any natural remedy that could help boost my memory?",I've been forgetting things more often lately.

246,"BACKGROUND: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a well-established and reputed  herb in Ayurvedic medicine. It has been used as a ""Rasayana"" (rejuvenator),  nootropic, and as a powerful natural adaptogen. The herb extract is extensively  used for general wellbeing and in specific ailments. However, only a few studies  have investigated the safety and tolerability of Ashwagandha in humans. This  study evaluated the safety of Ashwagandha root extract consumption in healthy  adults. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and  parallel-group study, 80 healthy participants (40 males, 40 females) were  randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ashwagandha 300 mg or a placebo of  the same dosage, twice daily, orally for 8 weeks. The study was conducted at MV  Hospital, and King George Medical University, Lucknow, India. The primary safety  outcomes considered were laboratory assessment of hematological parameters,  serum biochemistry analysis including hepatotoxicity evaluation, and thyroid  function parameters. The secondary outcomes of this study were the clinical  adverse events and the vital parameters. The within and between the groups'  datasets were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann Whitney  U test, respectively. RESULTS: A detailed evaluation of the vital signs such as body weight, body  temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood  pressure, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were conducted for each participant at the  baseline and the end of the study for treatment and placebo groups. Similarly,  hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the baseline and at  the end of study. The outcome did not indicate any untoward effects in any of  the treated volunteers. No statistically significant change or abnormality was  observed in the considered parameters including thyroid hormonal profile in both  the groups. No adverse events were reported by any of the participants in this  study. CONCLUSIONS: Ashwagandha is being consumed since time immemorial following the  Ayurvedic medicine practices.

247,"Traditional herbal preparations used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine,  traditional Tibetan medicine, and other Asian traditional medicine systems may  contain significant amounts of mercury, arsenic or lead. Though deliberately  incorporated in Asian traditional herbal preparations for therapeutic purposes,  these constituents have caused intoxications worldwide. The aim of this study  was therefore to determine mercury, arsenic, and lead levels in Asian  traditional herbal preparations on the Dutch market. A total of 292 traditional  herbal preparations used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and  traditional Tibetan medicine were sampled between 2004 and 2007. Samples were  mostly multi-ingredient traditional herbal preparations containing herbs and  minerals. The labeling of less than 20% of the traditional herbal preparations  suggested the presence of mercury, arsenic or lead. These elements were shown by  inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in 186 (64%) of 292 traditional  herbal preparations. Estimated weekly mercury, arsenic, and lead intake levels  were calculated for each traditional herbal preparation from the analytically  determined concentrations and the recommended dose. A total of 59 traditional  herbal preparations (20%) were likely to result in intakes of these elements  significantly exceeding safety limits. Of these 59 traditional herbal  preparations, intake estimates for 50 traditional herbal preparations  significantly exceeded the safety limit for mercury (range = 1.4-1747 mg  week(-1)); intake estimates for 26 traditional herbal preparations significantly  exceeded the safety limit for arsenic (range = 0.53-427 mg week(-1)) and intake  estimates for eight traditional herbal preparations were significantly above the  safety limit for lead (range = 2.6-192 mg week(-1)).

249,"The term Kriyakala refers to the recognition of the stage of a disease's  progress, which helps to determine appropriate measure to correct the imbalance  in Doshas (biological factors). It is a compound expression, comprised of Kriya  and Kala, where Kriya means the choice to treatment (medicine, food and  daily-routine) used to improve the disturbance in Doshas, and Kala refers to the  stage of progress of a disease. Sushruta, an ancient Indian surgeon, has  described the concept of Kriyakala in Varnaprashnadhyaya, an ancient Vedic  Sanskrit text, which seeks to explain the incidence of Varnas in terms of Doshic  disturbances. Varna, in modern parlance, may be described as an inflammatory  process that may lead ulceration and chronic inflammation, promoting all stages  of carcinogenesis. Abnormal interactions between Prakriti (genotype) and  environmental factors vitiate the Doshas and impair immunity, which can lead to  aberrant cell growth and cancer. Moreover, the interaction between vitiated  Doshas and weak Dhatus (body tissues) manifests as cancers of a specific organ.  Shatkriyakala (six stages of progress of a disease), on the other hand, provides  a framework to assess the cancer and its pathogenesis in different stages.  According to Ayurvedic concepts, all cancer therapies treat the affected tissues  indirectly by eliminating vitiated Doshas, rejuvenating Dhatus and restoring  immunity in cancer patients. The present review describes the six stages of  Shatkriyakala in detail, with an emphasis on research areas to validate the  concept of Shatkriyakala. This traditional knowledge can be utilized with modern  technologies to detect predisposition for cancer or diagnose cancer in its early  stages.",How can the concept of Kriyakala in Ayurveda be used to detect or diagnose cancer in its early stages?,"So, I've been hearing about this Ayurveda thing and how it can help detect early signs of cancer.

250,"BACKGROUND: Shortage of skilled birth attendants (SBA) is one of the  determinants of maternal mortality in India. To combat this shortage, innovative  task-shifting strategies to engage providers of the Indian system of medicine  (Ayurveda and Homeopathy), called AYUSH practitioners (AP), to provide SBA  services is being implemented. METHODS: Engagement of APs for SBA service provision was assessed in 3 states of  India (Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Odisha) through 73 in-depth interviews (37  with APs and 36 with programme managers). The interviews explored the providers'  SBA training experience, barriers for SBA service provision, workplace and  community acceptance, and the perspective of programme managers on the  competence and quality of SBA services provided. RESULTS: SBA training led to skill enhancement with adoption of appropriate  maternal and newborn care practices. A dedicated trainer, more hands-on  practice, and strengthening training on newborn care practices and management of  complications emerged as the training needs. Conditional involvement in  SBA-related work, a discriminatory attitude at the workplace and lack of  legal/regulatory authorisation were identified as barriers to the inclusion of  APs in SBA service provision. CONCLUSIONS: Quality skill enhancement measures, an enabling work environment, a  systematic task-shifting process, role definition, supportive supervision and  credentialing could be key for the integration of APs and their acceptance in  the health system.",What measures could be taken to better integrate practitioners of Ayurveda and Homeopathy in providing skilled birth attendant services in India?,"Are there ways to get more natural health providers involved in maternal care, especially in places where there's a shortage of trained birth attendants?",Is there a way for traditional Indian medicine practitioners to help with childbirth in areas where there's a shortage of skilled birth attendants?

The  treatment/prevention of ALys is not known yet. Therefore, searching for  therapeutic agents for amyloidosis is of great value. In this study, we have  examined the ability of the aqueous extract of herbalome (thirty herbal  components) of Chandraprabha vati (EHCV), a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, to  prevent fibrillation of lysozyme. Transmission electron microscopy and multiple  biophysical techniques were used to examine the processes. We found complete  inhibition of the fibrillation by EHCV, whereas none of the thirty ingredients  of EHCV was able to prevent the reaction, solely. We also found the EHCV induced  and stabilized secondary structures of aggregation-prone state (APS) of  lysozyme. Moreover, an increase in the secondary structure and stability of APS  were found to correlate with the inhibition reaction. We conclude that EHCV  modulates the structure and stability of APS and converts it into an aggregation  resistant state (ARS).

255,"OBJECTIVES: Ayurveda is one of the oldest comprehensive healthcare systems  worldwide. Ayurvedic massage and physical therapy are frequently used to treat  patients with chronic pain syndromes and disorders of the musculoskeletal  system. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic massage in  nonspecific chronic low back pain by means of a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN: Sixty-four patients (mean age, 54.8 years; 49 women and 15 men) with  chronic low back pain who scored >40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)  were randomly assigned to a 2-week massage group with 6 hours of Ayurvedic  massage and external treatment (n = 32) or to a 2-week local thermal therapy  group (n = 32). The study observation period was 4 weeks, consisting of a 2-week  intervention phase followed by a 2-week follow-up phase. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was the change of mean pain (VAS) from  baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included pain-related bothersomeness, the  Roland Disability Questionnaire, quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item  Short Form), the Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire for measuring back  pain-related disability, and psychological outcomes. Outcomes were assessed at  baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Mean back pain (primary outcome) at week 2 was significantly reduced  from 53.4 ± 18.5 to 21.6 ± 18.2 in the massage group and from 55.3 ± 12.9 to  41.8 ± 19.8 in the standard thermal therapy group (mean group difference, -18.7;  95% confidence interval, -28.7 to -8.7; p < 0.001). While beneficial effects on  pain-related bothersomeness and psychological well-being were also apparent, the  Ayurvedic intervention did not improve function or disability in the short-term  observation period. Both programs were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic external treatment is effective for pain-relief in  chronic low back pain in the short term.

257,"‏Shilajit is used commonly as Ayurvedic medicine worldwide which is Rasayana  herbo-mineral substance and consumed to restore the energetic balance and to  prevent diseases like cognitive disorders and Alzheimer. Locally, Shilajit is  applied for patients diagnosed with bone fractures. For safety of the patients,  the elemental analysis of Shilajit is imperative to evaluate its nutritional  quality as well as contamination from heavy metals. The elemental composition of  Shilajit was conducted using three advanced analytical techniques (LIBS, ICP,  and EDX). For the comparative studies, the two Shilajit kinds mostly sold  globally produced in India and Pakistan were collected. Our main focus is to  highlight nutritional eminence and contamination of heavy metals to hinge on  Shilajit therapeutic potential. In this work, laser-induced breakdown  spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the  Shilajit. Our LIBS analysis revealed that Shilajit samples composed of several  elements like Ca, S, K, Mg, Al, Na, Sr, Fe, P, Si, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Co,  Pb, Cu, As, Hg, Se, and Ti. Indian and Pakistani Shilajits were highly enriched  with Ca, S, and K nutrients and contained Al, Sr, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Pb, As,  and Hg toxins in amounts that exceeded the standard permissible limit. Even  though the content of most elements was comparable among both Shilajits,  nutrients, and toxins, in general, were accentuated more in Indian Shilajit with  the sole detection of Hg and Ti. The elemental quantification was done using  self-developed calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS)  method, and LIBS results are in well agreement with the concentrations  determined by standard ICP-OES/MS method. To verify our results by LIBS and  ICP-OES/MS techniques, EDX spectroscopy was also conducted which confirmed the  presence above mentioned elements. This work is highly significant for creating  awareness among people suffering due to overdose of this product and save many  human lives.",Can Shilajit be harmful if consumed in excess due to its heavy metal content?,"I've heard that Shilajit can help with energy and focus, but is it safe to use?

258,"CONTEXT: Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medical system, is receivingincreasing  attention worldwide. OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study was conducted to determine the effectiveness  ofAyurvedic constitution-based diets on weight loss patterns of obese adults.  DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: Records of 200 obese adults, both  male and female, who had completed 3 months of the diet therapy at Ayurvedic  clinics, were examined and data collated. Techniques used included a checklist  of personality traits, physical signs, and food likes and dislikes to determine  the dosha. Based on the predominant doshas, diets were prescribed and closely  monitored for a period of 3 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Records of height and weight and chest, abdominal, waist, arm,  and thigh circumferences noted initially and after each month for the period of  3 months were obtained. RESULTS: Among the 200 subjects, 55 (27.5%) were vatta-, 83 (41.5%) were pitta-,  and 62 (31.0%) were kapha-predominant. At the beginning, kapha and pitta people  were heavier than vatta people. After the 3 months of therapy, the pitta group  lost the most weight (9.84%). The decrease in all the anthropometric  measurements was higher in pitta and kapha people than in vatta individuals.  Hence, diets based on Ayurvedic constitution may prove useful in promoting  weight loss. Though these promising findings support traditional Indian  Ayurvedic scriptures, more closely controlled trials are needed to substantiate  these findings.",Can following an Ayurvedic constitution-based diet help me lose weight?,"So, I've been trying to lose some weight.

259,"Ayurveda is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, namely, ""Ayus"" and ""Veda,"" meaning  life and knowledge, respectively. It literally means science of life. Ayurveda,  of which yoga is an integral part, is widely practiced in India and is gaining  acceptance in many countries around the world. It is a comprehensive and a  holistic system, the focus of which is on the body, mind, and consciousness. The  Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal preparations, diet, yoga,  meditation, and other practices. Based on the review of available studies, the  evidence is not convincing that any Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective in  the treatment of heart disease or hypertension. However, the use of certain  spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in an overall healthy diet is  appropriate. Many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners show promise and could  be appropriate for larger randomized trials. Yoga, an integral part of Ayurveda,  has been shown to be useful to patients with heart disease and hypertension.  Yoga reduces anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life. Its  safety profile is excellent. Its use as a complementary therapeutic regimen  under medical supervision is appropriate and could be worth considering.","Can Ayurveda practices, such as yoga and the use of certain herbs, aid in the treatment of heart disease and hypertension?","I've heard about Ayurveda and yoga being good for your health, but does it actually help with things like heart disease or high blood pressure?",Can practicing yoga or including certain herbs in my diet help me manage my high blood pressure?
260,"Fifteen Ayurvedic medicines of Ras-family (herbo-mineral-metallic preparations)  from three reputed manufactures were analysed for elemental quantification and  their chemical phase identification using the energy-dispersive (ED) and  wavelength-dispersive (WD) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques, and powder X-ray  diffraction (XRD) technique, respectively. The low-Z elements C, H, N, S and O  constituting a major portion of these medicines were also determined by CHNSO  analyser and further used as input for XRF analyses. The elements of concern,  Hg, Pb and As, are identified in different medicine products with disquiet  concentration values (maximum concentration values range ~ 4-10%) and that too  with substantial variations in the products from different manufacturers. These  elements are identified mainly in the cinnabar (α-HgS)/metacinnabar (β-HgS),  litharge (PbO) and alacranite (As4S4) phases in different medicines. Keeping in  view the high concentration of chemicals of the Hg, Pb and As elements in the  Ras-family medicines, it is vitally required to investigate their  bioaccessibility and surmise the associated toxicological aspects. It is  suggested that the formation of the bioaccessible toxic chemical forms of the  Hg, Pb and As elements be avoided during preparation of the mineral ingredients  or these soluble chemical forms be removed at suitable stage of the preparation.  In view of large variations observed for the Hg, Pb and As based ingredients in  the Ras family Ayurvedic medicine products from different manufacturers,  adequate quality control mechanisms and production regulations are recommended.",Are there any safety concerns related to the use of Ayurvedic medicines from the Ras-family?,"I've been thinking about trying some Ayurvedic medicines, but I've heard some might have heavy metals in them.

261,"The retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of  Ayurveda treatment exposure as an add-on to conventional care in early stage  COVID-19 patients admitted at Samaras COVID care center, Ahmedabad, India.  Conventional care included Vitamin-c, Azithromycin, and Paracetamol. Ayurveda  formulations used as add-on were Dashamula and Pathyadi decoctions along with  Trikatu powder, Sanshamani tablet, AYUSH-64 tablet AND Yastimadhu Ghana tablet  for oral administration. Considering Add-on Ayurveda medicines as exposure of  interest, patients who received Add-on Ayurveda medicines at least for 7 days  were included in the exposed group while those who received only conventional  care in unexposed group. Data was collected through record review and telephonic  interviews. The outcomes of interest were the development of symptoms, duration  of symptomatic phase in those progressing to symptomatic stage and mortality.  Total 762 participants were included-[541 (71%) in the exposed group and 221  (29%) in the unexposed.

262,"Triphala is a well-known prescription in Indian Ayurveda and TCM medicine for  its great effect on gingivitis and hyperlipidemia. However, its solution is  unstable for the containing of excessive polyphenol, leading to the production  of sediment in the short term and the decrease of efficacy. Based on the  analysis of sediment formation, a novel control strategy is proposed. To conduct  the analysis, the sediment formation was recorded for a consecutive five days.  The changes in the composition of the supernatant and the sediment were studied  by the HPLC profile analysis. The main components of the sediment were  identified as corilagin, ellagic acid and gallic acid, and the amount of ellagic  acid sediment increased with the storage time. Then, with a series of pH status  adjustments of the Triphala solution, the physical and chemical stabilities were  acquired by Turbiscan and HPLC respectively. The results showed that as the pH  value increased, so did the physical stability, but the particle size and TSI of  the association decreased. While the fingerprint of chemical profile similarity  decreased, so did the chemical stability. Combining physical and chemical  stability parameters, an equilibrium point was found out. When the pH value was  adjusted to 5.0, both the physical and chemical stabilities were better: the  verification test showed that the sedimentation inhibition rates on the 3rd,  5th,10th and15th days were 41%, 55%, 41%, and 23%, respectively.

263,"OBJECTIVES: Institute for Research in Medical Statistics, Indian Council of  Medical Research, Delhi undertook a study to obtain all India estimate of  utilization of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy (ISM&H). METHODS: The study covered 35 districts spreading over 19 States of India. In  this article, results for the State of West Bengal are being presented. Selected  districts in West Bengal were Midnapore and Darjeeling where about 2400 sick  persons from 2000 households were studied. RESULTS: About 20% sick persons actually availed ISM&H treatment in the State.  Majority availed Homeopathy followed by Ayurvedic medicines. Use of Unani and  Siddha is negligible in this State. In case of minor ailments, ISM&H was  preferred by about 15% in Darjeeling district and 42% in Midnapore district. In  case of serious illnesses, about 12% in Darjeeling district preferred ISM&H, but  very few (about 5%) preferred this in Midnapore. 39.4% and 20.8% of sick persons  sought treatment from traditional healers in Midnapore and Darjeeling district  respectively. Jaundice, snakebite, dog bite and 'bone setting' were some of the  conditions for which traditional healers were mostly visited.

264,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on  the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Computerized literature searches for all RCTs of Ayurvedic medicine for  RA in the following databases: Medline (March 1969 to March 2003), Embase  (February 1985 to February 2003), AMED (March 1980 to March 2003), Cochrane  Controlled Trial Register (October 1997 to March 2003), and the abstract service  of Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS; 1976 to March  2003). Hand searches were performed in 1 Sri Lankan and 3 Indian journals and  the authors' personal files. Key data of included studies were extracted and  reviewed. The methodological quality of all studies was evaluated with the Jadad  scale. RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Trials tested either  Ayurvedic medicine against placebo or other Ayurvedic medicines. In general,  patient and physician global assessments on the severity of pain, and morning  stiffness were used as endpoints. Of 3 placebo-controlled RCTs, 1 high-quality  trial did not show benefit of the active treatment against placebo, while  another incompletely reported study indicated beneficial effects of an Ayurvedic  medicine. A further incompletely reported study showed no significant  difference. The remaining 4 trials were difficult to interpret because they  tested an Ayurvedic medicine against other Ayurvedic medicines whose effects  were not proven.

266,"The National Rural Health Mission has stated as one of its key mandates the  mainstreaming of the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy  (AYUSH) systems in order to help solve the human resource shortage in Indian  healthcare. This has been planned at the primary level by providing training to  AYUSH practitioners on primary care and national health programmes; at the  secondary level by establishing departments of AYUSH in the district and taluka  level hospitals; and at the tertiary level  by establishing AYUSH centres of  excellence as referral centres, and research, development and supervision  points. The practical challenges to be considered include a gross divergence in  the basic philosophy of practice; disparities in approach to specific clinical  conditions; differences in their normative approach in decision making; an  unclear policy for cross referral and problems of cross practice that could  potentially rise in this condition. Mainstreaming of AYUSH into the existing  public health system can have certain ethical implications: not doing good by  failing to concentrate on the community value judgments about AYUSH; doing harm  by a confusing plurality in approach and unhealthy segregation of practices  without healthy dialogue between practitioners of either system; not disclosing  which type of practitioners (AYUSH or allopathy) the patient is seeing; lack of  proper public accountability mechanisms at the primary care and grassroots  levels; and, finally, lack of social justice.

267,"Ayurveda is a natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000  years ago. Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being  through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and  environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides  treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be  essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving  this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the  psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and  lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year. Common spices are  utilized in treatment, as well as herbs and herbal mixtures, and special  preparations known as Rasayanas are used for rejuvenation, promotion of  longevity, and slowing of the aging process. A group of purification procedures  known as Panchakarma removes toxins from the physiology. Whereas Western  allopathic medicine is excellent in handling acute medical crises, Ayurveda  demonstrates an ability to manage chronic disorders that Western medicine has  been unable to.

268,"According to survey data, 35-69% of patients with skin disease have used  complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in their lifetime. A literature  search on this subject reveals a number of studies on the efficacy of CAM  treatment for dermatologic conditions, as well as a number of articles showing  the growing prevalence of CAM use amongst patients suffering from these  conditions. Given the consensus amongst these articles that dermatologists  require increased education on CAM, this paper presents an overview of some of  the most widely used systems of alternative medicine to serve as a tool for  practicing dermatologists. Specifically, the history and theory behind  psychocutaneous therapies, traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture),  homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine will be described, along with current  evidence for their efficacy and reports of their adverse effects. The authors  conclude that more evidence and better studies are needed for each of the major  CAM modalities before they may be considered as independent therapeutic options.  Moreover, given the shortage of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of  CAM, dermatologists should obtain a thorough history of CAM use from their  patients. In general, ingestible substances including most homeopathic,  Ayurvedic, and traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulations that are not US  FDA regulated should be viewed with caution as they may cause severe adverse  effects such as arsenicosis and hepatotoxicity. On the other hand, less invasive  techniques such as acupuncture and psychocutaneous therapies may be more  acceptable given their low-risk profile.

269,"Background: Regulatory affairs play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical  industry and are incorporated in all stages of drug development. Objective:  Approval criteria practices were developed as a resolution of the government's  desire to create policies to protect public health by controlling the safety and  efficacy of merchandise in areas including pharmaceuticals, complementary color  medicines, veterinary medicines, medical devices, and even food products and  cosmetics. Method: Herbal health products are in practices in all parts of the  world under either their legal system's or expert council's or agencies' guides.  They include botanicals, health supplements, health foods, complimentary  medicines, traditional medicines or following pathies like Ayurveda, Yoga,  Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy.

270,"BACKGROUND: The curricula of Ayurveda programmes emphasise various theoretical  constructs such as Tridosha (three factors determining the state of health),  Agnibala (digestive strength), Samprapti (patho-physiology), among others. It is  often argued that practitioners follow an individualised approach based on these  principles while treating patients. Yet, dependable data on their real-world  influence is lacking. The aim of this study was to record the extent to which  these constructs drive decision-making among Ayurveda practitioners and to  examine whether these constructs determine individualisation of the  interventions. METHODS: We employed an emailed survey to record physicians' perceptions.  Convenience sampling was chosen as the sampling method. Registered Ayurveda  practitioners located across India with a minimum of five years of clinical  experience were invited to participate. Five case-based scenarios depicting  different clinical conditions were presented to the physicians. Questions that  accompanied each case scenario asked the physicians to record clinical  diagnoses, treatment plans, and the Ayurveda principles that determined their  treatment. RESULTS: A total of 141 physicians responded, from whom we received 152  responses as seven physicians responded to more than one scenario. The results  suggest a significant lack of consensus among physicians regarding clinical  diagnoses, interventions, and their understanding of pathophysiology in the  given clinical scenarios. Many conflicting opinions were also noted. CONCLUSION: Theoretical constructs do not appear to determine either  prescriptions or individualisation uniformly. Two ethical questions arise: ""Is  this situation due to an inherently weak theoretical framework of Ayurveda?"" and  ""How can one justify spending hundreds of hours teaching these theories?""",How do Ayurvedic principles guide the treatment plans of practitioners?,"I heard that Ayurvedic doctors personalize treatments based on certain principles.

274,"This paper introduces Vedic principles of therapy as a holistic integration of  healing and human development. The most integrative aspect is a  ""consciousness-based"" approach in which the bottom line of the mind is  consciousness itself, accessed by transcending mental activity to its simplest  ground state. This directly contrasts with ""unconscious-based"" approaches that  hold the basis of conscious mind is the unconscious, such as analytic,  humanistic, and cognitive-behavioral approaches. Although not presented as a  specific therapeutic approach, interventions associated with this Vedic approach  have extensive support in the applied research literature. A brief review of  experimental research toward a general model of mind-and cutting-edge  developments in quantum physics toward nonlocal mind-shows a convergence on the  ancient Vedic model of mind.

276,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Taste (rasa) is traditionally valued in Ayurveda  as an important ethnopharmacological category, and reported to correlate with  certain therapeutic activities (karman). The present paper endeavors to provide  for the first time a type of mapping of ayurvedic ethnopharmacological space by  the integration of medicinal plant taste-activity relationship (TA) data,  originating from several traditional sources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present TA database included 183 ayurvedic medicinal  plants, with their traditional description of taste and ethnophamacological  actions (EPA). 111 plants had a unique taste, and 72 plants a combination of  several tastes, consisting of one principal taste, and other 2-4 secondary  tastes. 121 ethnopharmacological actions were considered. Potential global or  individual associations between rasa and karman were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant global correspondence between the  predominant plant taste and the ethnopharmacological activities (Chi-square  test, p<0.05), and the following individual associations (Fisher exact test,  p<0.05, positive association if lnOR >0, negative association if lnOR <0):  bitter- 11 positive associations (lnOR 0.940 to 3.544) and 8 negative  associations (lnOR -0.997 to -3.101), sweet- 14 positive associations (lnOR  0.839 to 3.132) and 20 negative associations (lnOR -0.962 to -3.270), pungent-  23 positive associations (lnOR 0.835 to 4.126) and 11 negative associations  (lnOR -1.255 to -3.147), astringent- 7 positive associations (lnOR 1.099 to  3.813) and 7 negative associations (lnOR -1.076 to -2.631), sour- 7 positive  associations (lnOR 1.128 to 4.664) and 1 negative association (lnOR -2.244).  Among the 109 statistically significant associations, 24 were not traditionally  mentioned, and only 4 were in opposition with the traditional ayurvedic sources. DISCUSSIONS: The present study confirms the traditional relationship rasa-karman  and demonstrates that statistical models can be used to predict EPAs of  medicinal plants depending on their taste.

277,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has sparked a new  spectrum of investigations, research and studies in multifarious directions.  Efforts are being made around the world for discovery of effective  vaccines/drugs against COVID-19. In this context, Ayurveda, an alternative  traditional system of medicine in India may work as an adjuvant therapy in  compromised patients. We selected 40 herbal leads on the basis of their  traditional applications. The phytomolecules from these leads were further  screened through in-silico molecular docking against two main targets of  SARS-CoV-2 i.e. the spike protein (S; structural protein) and the main protease  (MPRO; non-structural protein). Out of the selected 40, 12 phytomolecules were  able to block or stabilize the major functional sites of the main protease and  spike protein. Among these, Ginsenoside, Glycyrrhizic acid, Hespiridin and  Tribulosin exhibited high binding energy with both main protease and spike  protein.

278,"Traditional medicine (TM) also known as folk medicine consists of medical  knowledge systems that were developed over generations in various countries  before the era of modern medicine. Over the last few years, there has been a  shift in universal trend from modern medicine to TM because it is believed that  these medicines are non-toxic to humans, have little to no side-effects, are  readily available and affordable. The purpose of this study was to investigate  the essential and non-essential elemental concentrations of ayurvedic medicines  (AM), Ghanaian traditional medicines (GTM) and Chinese traditional medicines  (CTM). The results indicate that the mean elemental concentrations in TM varied  greatly. The mean concentrations of copper and mercury in AM, GTM and CTM ranged  from 4 to 45 mg/kg and 0.01 to 2 mg/kg, respectively. Multivariate statistical  analyses applied to recognise inter-element associations indicated that at 0.05  significant level, there was a positive correlation between elements suggesting  they may have originated from the same source. The study concludes by  highlighting the need for monitoring of the elemental concentrations in commonly  consumed traditional medicines regularly to detect contamination in these  medicines since the occurrence of metals in these medicines above or below  legally permissible limits can be harmful to consumers.","What precautions should I take when using traditional medicines like Ayurvedic, Ghanaian, and Chinese medicines?",I've been thinking about trying out some traditional medicines like ayurvedic or Chinese ones.

281,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: For thousands of years, medicinal plants have  played an important role throughout the world in treating and preventing a  variety of diseases. Kani tribal people in Tirunelveli hills still depend on  medicinal plants and most of them have a general knowledge of medicinal plants  which are used for first aid remedies, to treat cough, cold, fever, headache,  poisonous bites and some simple ailments. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was initiated with an aim to identify  traditional healers who are practicing herbal medicine among the Kani tribals in  Tirunelveli hills of Western Ghats, India and quantitatively document their  indigenous knowledge on the utilization of medicinal plants particularly most  common ethnomedicinal plants. METHODS: Field study was carried out over a period of 4 years in Tirunelveli  hills. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews among the  Kani traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through use value  (UV), informant consensus factor (F(ic)), fidelity level (FL) and relative  importance (RI). RESULTS: A total of 90 species of plants distributed in 83 genera belonging to  52 families were identified as commonly used ethnomedicinal plants by the Kani  traditional healers in Tirunelveli hills for the treatment of 65 types of  ailments. These ailments were categorized into 15 ailment categories based on  the body systems treated. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and  most of the medicines were prepared in the form of paste and administered  orally. F(ic) values of the present study indicated that there was a high  agreement in the use of plants in the treatment of jaundice and diabetes among  the users. Dermatological infections/diseases and gastro-intestinal disorders  had highest use-reports and 29 species of plants had the highest fidelity level  of 100%. The most important species according to their use value were Gymneme  sylvestre (2.00), Melia azedarach, Murraya koenigii, Syzygium cumini and  Terminalia chebula (1.83).

282,"Background Herbal formulations, traditional medicine, and complementary and  alternative medicine are used by the majority of the world's population.  Toxicity associated with use of Ayurvedic products due to metal content is an  increasingly recognized potential public health problem. Objectives Report on  toxic metals content of Ayurvedic products obtained during an investigation of  lead poisoning among users of Ayurvedic medicine. Methods Samples of Ayurvedic  formulations were analyzed for metals and metalloids following established US.  Environmental Protection Agency methods. Results Lead was found in 65% of 252  Ayurvedic medicine samples with mercury and arsenic found in 38 and 32% of  samples, respectively. Almost half of samples containing mercury, 36% of samples  containing lead and 39% of samples containing arsenic had concentrations of  those metals per pill that exceeded, up to several thousand times, the  recommended daily intake values for pharmaceutical impurities.

284,"All the plants and their secondary metabolites used in the present study were  obtained from Ayurveda, with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. The  selected secondary metabolites have been experimentally validated and reported  as potent antiviral agents against genetically-close human viruses. The plants  have also been used as a folk medicine to treat cold, cough, asthma, bronchitis,  and severe acute respiratory syndrome in India and across the globe since time  immemorial. The present study aimed to assess the repurposing possibility of  potent antiviral compounds with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and also with  host-specific receptor and activator protease that facilitates the viral entry  into the host body. Molecular docking (MDc) was performed to study molecular  affinities of antiviral compounds with aforesaid target proteins. The  top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further  validated by 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation run. The stability of the  conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy  using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were  also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein  RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent  compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc  and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a  strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In  contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp  and quercetin with main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target  proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore,  compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral  replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own  multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance  therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in  vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of  antiviral plants preventively.",What natural remedies from Ayurveda could potentially help combat COVID-19?,"So, I've heard about using natural remedies like ginger to boost immunity and fight off colds.

285,"Early awakening and early to bed as well as good conduct, thought, diet,  interpersonal dealings and physical activity have been suggested for healthy  life in Ayurveda. Circadian rhythms, coordinated in part by the parietal  hypothalamic-pituitary and adrenal mechanisms, have been reported in almost all  variables examined thus far, including the circulation. It is possible that all  metabolic functions undergo circadian rhythms. It remains to be explored whether  these rhythms may be optimized by Ayurvedic practices. The onsets of myocardial  ischemia, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death,  and strokes have been reported to exhibit a circadian variation, with increased  frequency in the second quarter of the day. An increased physical and mental  load caused by an attempt to prepare for the day may be important in triggering  acute cardiovascular events. Depending on their timing, meditation (Ayurvedic  practice), n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, beta-blockers and estrogens may have  beneficial effects, whereas progestins and mental load may have adverse effects  on heart rate and blood pressure variability, which may be expressed by  different circadian patterns. Around the clock serial recordings of blood  pressure and heart rate during usual activities and lifestyles may be recorded  and may be analyzed by computer-implemented curve fitting to assess the about  24-hour (circadian) variation, among other rhythmic, chaotic, and trend  components of the time structure (chronome) of these variables. The new disease  risk syndrome circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), a condition  characterized by an excessive circadian amplitude of blood pressure, cannot be  ascertained on the basis of single casual blood pressure measurements.

286,"OBJECTIVES: Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic recommended during  pregnancy. Bacopa monneri is a medicinal herb used in Ayurveda for improvement  of cognition. Data on effects of LEV and Bacopa on cognition is inadequate. The  study evaluated the cognitive effects of LEV on rat offspring of dams exposed to  LEV and whether pretreatment with Bacopa monnieri, inhibits the potential  cognitive decline by LEV. METHODS: Pregnant rats were allocated into four groups of three rats each.  Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 received 2% gum acacia, LEV 270 mg/kg, LEV  270 mg/kg + Bacopa 100 mg/kg and LEV 270 mg/kg + Bacopa 200 mg/kg respectively  during pregnancy and lactation. Three pups from all dams were chosen at random  and exposed to passive avoidance, Hebb-Williams and Morris water maze tests to  check for their cognition and relevant histopathology was done. RESULTS: In the passive avoidance model groups 3 and 4, showed an increase in  escape latency compared with group 2, demonstrating an improved learning  (p=0.05). In Hebb-Williams maze, the time taken to reach reward chamber by group  2 increased compared to group 1, p=0.006, showing cognitive decline. Neuronal  count in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex decreased significantly in group 2,  which improved in group 3 & 4 however there was distortion of architecture in  group 4.

289,"INTRODUCTION: Immunity boosting has emerged as a global strategy to fight the  SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation. In India, AYUSH systems of medicine have been  promoted as an immune-protection strategy. Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F)  Nees (AP) mentioned in Ayurveda has been widely used for treating sore throat,  flu, and upper respiratory tract infections which may provide possible novel  therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. OBJECTIVES: The present work uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics and combination synergy analysis based on network  pharmacology to mine multimode evidence to understand the possible mechanism of  action, diseases association, protein-protein interaction and major pathways  involved therein. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Metabolite profiling was performed by Agilent QTOF  LC-MS/MS system. Network pharmacology analysis was performed by using functional  annotation analysis based on databases like Binding DB, STRING, DAVID and KEGG  for further data mining. Further combination synergy was evaluated using  ""neighbourhood approach"" and networks were constructed through Cytoscape 3.2.1. RESULTS: The molecules from kalmegh provides immune-protection and anti-viral  response via involving different pathways, like toll-like receptor pathway,  PI3/AKT pathway and MAP kinase pathways against COVID-19 infection. The KEGG  analysis showed that in a vast majority of the most enriched pathways, AP were  associated with viral infections and upper respiratory tract infections.

290,"BACKGROUND: Treatments offered at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway  are based on Maharishi Vedic medicine, which is also known as Maharishi  Ayurveda. It is a consciousness based revival of the ancient Ayurvedic medicine  tradition in India and is established by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of  the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot study of the effect of the treatment program at  the Health Centre on fibromyalgia patients. METHODS: Thirty-one women with diagnosed fibromyalgia received an individually  designed Maharishi Vedic physiological purification therapy. All subjects  received personal advice on diet based on Ayurvedic principles, including a  novel approach to food into-lerance, and daily routines. In addition they were  offered instruction in TM (for stress and pain management and personal  development) (four subjects started), and recommended Ayurvedic herbal food  products for home treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A modified Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire included a  visual analogue scale for each of the seven outcomes: working ability,  generalised pain, tiredness, stiffness, tiredness on arising, anxiety and  depression. Pre-treatment scores were compared with scores at six-month  follow-up for levels of statistical significance. RESULTS: Twenty-eight subjects (90%) completed the follow-up. The outcome  measures were reduced by 25 to 46% by the study's endpoint: working ability  (p<0.002), pain (p<0.001), tiredness (p<0.001), morning tiredness (p<0.001),  stiffness (p<0.005), anxiety (p<0.136), and depression (p<0.001). A group of  five excellent responders including all four participants who started to  practise TM, had almost no symptoms by the endpoint. Compared to the  non-meditating control group the TM-subgroup showed statistically significant  improvements for all outcome measures except depression.

302,"RATIONALE: Ayurvedic herbal medicines are administered as part of disease  management for many neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder  (ASD) and linked comorbid challenges. The biochemistry of the behavioral  abnormalities as observed in comorbid conditions is already reported to involve  neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT) and  dopamine (DA). The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of ayurvedic  medicines on neurotransmitter levels in IMR 32. Such a study will give some  insight into the molecular mechanism of the action of these medicines and help  us to understand their contributions in neurotransmitter homeostasis. METHODS: Solutions of Brahmi, Brahmi vati, Brahmi ghrita and Saraswata ghrita,  each at 50 μM, were added to differentiated IMR 32 cells and grown for 24 h. The  cell secretion was analysed by ultra-fast liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometry (UFLC/MS) in electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode for the  neurotransmitters DA, 5-HT and GABA. The mobile phase selected was 0.1% formic  acid with 15 μg/mL Na2 -EDTA (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B)  introduced in the ratio of 92:8. RESULTS: All neurotransmitters under study were eluted within 7 min with GABA  eluting at 3.82 min, 5-HT at 4.48 min and DA at 5.47 min, respectively.  Linearity was excellent with a correlation coefficient (R(2) ) of 0.999;  repeatability and accuracy were also within acceptable range. All herbal drugs  evaluated increased the neurotransmitter levels and Brahmi vati increased the  neurotransmitter levels to a larger extent. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased levels of neurotransmitters were observed in behavioral  abnormalities which were also observed in children with ASD. Herbal medicines  given as part of ayurvedic medicine increased the neurotransmitter levels in IMR  32. Thus, these ayurvedic medicines when prescribed to children with ASD might  alleviate the abnormal behavioral symptoms by maintaining neurotransmitter  homeostasis.

303,"Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb. is a medicinal plant used for the treatment  of various ailments in the traditional system of medicine like Ayurveda where it  has been prescribed as a rejuvenator and general health tonic. The fruit of the  plant is one of the components of the age old ayurvedic formulation-'Triphala'.  The present study evaluates curative effect of aqueous acetone extract of  Terminalia bellirica fruits (AATB) against CCl4 induced oxidative stress and  liver damage in an animal model. Two doses of the fruit extract (200mg/kg body  weight and 400mg/kg body weight) were investigated for the beneficial effects.  At the end of the treatment, liver function markers (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH,  total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin-globulin ratio) as  well as hepatic oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, GSH) were evaluated.  Treatment with AATB significantly restored the parameters towards normal level  as compared to the elevated biochemical markers in the CCl4 treated animals.  Reversal to normal tissue architecture was observed in histological evaluation.  The results of AATB (400mg/kg) were found comparable with that of standard drug  silymarin in all the parameters. The above findings suggest the therapeutic  potential of the plant in alleviating hepatic oxidative stress and tissue  damage, hence the traditional use of the plant in this regard stands justified.",What are some natural remedies for liver damage and oxidative stress?,I've heard that some plants can be really good for your health.

305,"Siotone (ST) is a herbal formulation comprising of Withania somnifera, Ocimum  sanctum, Asparagus racemosus, Tribulus terristris and shilajit, all of which are  classified in Ayurveda as rasayanas which are reputed to promote physical and  mental health, improve defence mechanisms of the body and enhance longevity.  These attributes are similar to the modern concept of adaptogenic agents, which  are, known to afford protection of the human physiological system against  diverse stressors. The present study was undertaken to investigate the  adaptogenic activity of ST against chronic unpredictable, but mild, footshock  stress induced perturbations in behaviour (depression), glucose metabolism,  suppressed male sexual behaviour, immunosuppression and cognitive dysfunction in  CF strain albino rats. Gastric ulceration, adrenal gland and spleen weights,  ascorbic acid and corticosterone concentrations of adrenal cortex, and plasma  corticosterone levels, were used as the stress indices. Panax ginseng (PG) was  used as the standard adaptogenic agent for comparison. Additionally, rat brain  levels of tribulin, an endogenous endocoid postulated to be involved in stress,  were also assessed in terms of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and MAOB  inhibitory activity. Chronic unpredictable footshock induced marked gastric  ulceration, significant increase in adrenal gland weight and plasma  corticosterone levels, with concomitant decreases in spleen weight, and  concentrations of adrenal gland ascorbic acid and corticosterone. These effects  were attenuated by ST (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg, p.o.),  administered once daily over a period of 14 days, the period of stress  induction. Chronic stress also induced glucose intolerance, suppressed male  sexual behaviour, induced behavioural depression (Porsolt's swim despair test  and learned helplessness test) and cognitive dysfunction (attenuated retention  of learning in active and passive avoidance tests), and immunosuppression  (leucocyte migration inhibition and sheep RBC challenged increase in paw oedema  in sensitized rats). All these chronic stress-induced perturbations were  attenuated, dose-dependently by ST (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg,  p.o.). Chronic stress-induced increase in rat brain tribulin activity was also  reversed by these doses of ST and by PG. The results indicate that ST has  significant adaptogenic activity, qualitatively comparable to PG, against a  variety of behavioural, biochemical and physiological perturbations induced by  unpredictable stress, which has been proposed to be a better indicator of  clinical stress than acute stress parameters. The likely contribution of the  individual constituents of ST in the observed adaptogenic action of the  polyherbal formulation, have been discussed.",Can the herbal formulation Siotone help reduce stress and improve mental health?,I've been feeling really stressed out lately and it's messing with my mood and health.

306,"Ayurvedic medicines have been gaining in popularity around the world in recent  decades, but have also been associated with lead contamination and poisoning. In  2012 in Durban, South Africa, a lead poisoning outbreak among adolescents was  associated with the consumption of an Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of  skin conditions. In 2014 eight individuals (out of 12 affected) were traced and  interviewed. Questionnaires were administered; blood samples were taken for lead  content analysis; and medical records were reviewed. Samples of the implicated  medicines were analyzed to determine lead levels. Blood lead levels during the  acute phase ranged from 34 to 116 µg/dL; and during the current study (two years  later) from 13 to 34 µg/dL. The implicated lead capsules had a lead content of  125,235 µg/g. Participants suffered a wide range of non-specific ill health  symptoms; and there was a significant delay in the diagnosis of lead poisoning.  This study highlights the potential for lead poisoning outbreaks from the  consumption of Ayurvedic medicines in African settings.

307,"Rasasindura (RS) is an Ayurvedic medicine, which contains ∼99% α-HgS. It is used  as a rejuvenating agent and commonly used to treat diseases such as syphilis,  insomnia, high fever, and nervous disorders. Cinnabar ore (α-HgS) is a  well-known mineral, which is readily available. Despite it, Ayurvedic  practitioners adopted an involved and tedious procedure for the preparation of  RS. In this study, three samples, one was Ayurvedic (RS), the second one was the  commercial (HGS), and the third one was cinnabar ore (CN), were physiochemically  examined. Zebrafish model was employed for toxicity study with an oral dose of  100 mg/kg/day for the three samples for 10 days. We found that RS conferred  novel physicochemical properties, which were not seen in HGS and CN.  Significantly, the average crystallite size of RS was lowest (26 nm) as compared  to HGS (31 nm) and CN (34 nm), and the rate of increase of crystallite size with  temperature was lowest in RS. RS did not show any significant behavioral  toxicity in zebrafish, which was seen with the HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish.  HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish showed a significantly high (∗∗∗p < 0.001) decrease  (77 ± 7.6% and 51 ± 6.5%, respectively) of glutathione (GSH) levels in the  brain, however, for RS-treated zebrafish, the change of GSH was insignificant  (26 ± 2.5%, p > 0.05). Interestingly, HGS significantly altered the  γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in brain tissue. Therefore, among all three samples,  RS exhibited the lowest toxicity, which can be credited to the distinct  toxicokinetics by these samples.",What are some benefits of using Rasasindura as an Ayurvedic treatment?,I've been having trouble sleeping and heard about this Ayurvedic medicine called Rasasindura.

310,"BACKGROUND: Mahasudarshan Churna (MC) is a polyherbal Ayurvedic medicine that is  employed in fever (especially chronic type), cold and malaria, improvement of  digestion and appetite, removes toxins from the blood, boosts immunity and  protects against common bacterial infections. METHODS: Validation and quantification of oleanolic acid (OA), ursolic acid  (UA), mangiferin (M), gallic acid (GA), quercetin (Q) and curcumin (C) in  commercial MC formulations by HPTLC method. Mobile phase, hexane: ethyl acetate:  acetone (16.4: 3.6: 0.2, v/v) was used for the separation of OA and UA; ethyl  acetate: glacial acetic acid: formic acid: water (20: 2.2: 2.2: 5.2 v/v) for the  development of M; and toluene: ethyl acetate: formic acid (13.5: 9: 0.6 v/v) for  the separation of GA, Q and C in crude sample extracts. Visualization and  scanning were performed at λ = 530 nm for OA and UA, at λ = 254 nm for M and at  λ = 366 nm for GA, Q and C. In addition, HPLC-PDA analysis was used to confirm  the HPTLC results. RESULTS: Major bio-active compounds in MC formulations were oleanolic acid  (1.54-1.78%), mangiferin (1.38-1.52%) and gallic acid (1.01-1.15%); followed by  ursolic acid (0.79-0.98%), curcumin (0.45-0.67%) and quercetin (0.22-0.34%). CONCLUSION: Analysis of bio-active compounds in the present study was performed  using HPTLC methods and later HPTLC results were compared with HPLC. These two  methods give comparable results and there was no statistically significant  difference between the mean values for all extracts. Present study concluded  that this HPTLC technique is low cost, fast, precise, and accurate which can be  employed for the quantification of xanthonoid (M), triterpenoids (OA, UA) and  phenolics (GA, Q and C) in samples/formulations. Furthermore, present HPTLC  method can be conveniently employed for routine quality control analysis of all  the six marker compounds in marketed Ayurvedic/herbal formulations.","What are the health benefits of Mahasudarshan Churna, an Ayurvedic medicine?",I've been hearing a lot about this Mahasudarshan Churna stuff.

311,"Ashwagandha, also called as ""Queen of Ayurveda"" and ""Indian ginseng"", is a  commonly used plant in Indian traditional medicine, Ayurveda. Its roots have  been used as herb remedy to treat a variety of ailments and to promote general  wellness. However, scientific evidence to its effects is limited to only a small  number of studies. We had previously identified anti-cancer activity in the leaf  extract (i-Extract) of Ashwagandha and demonstrated withanone as a cancer  inhibitory factor (i-Factor). In the present study, we fractionated the  i-Extract to its components by silica gel column chromatography and subjected  them to cell based activity analyses. We found that the cancer inhibitory leaf  extract (i-Extract) has, at least, seven components that could cause cancer cell  killing; i-Factor showed the highest selectivity for cancer cells and i-Factor  rich Ashwagandha leaf powder was non-toxic and anti-tumorigenic in mice assays.  We undertook a gene silencing and pathway analysis approach and found that  i-Extract and its components kill cancer cells by at least five different  pathways, viz. p53 signaling, GM-CFS signaling, death receptor signaling,  apoptosis signaling and G2-M DNA damage regulation pathway. p53 signaling was  most common. Visual analysis of p53 and mortalin staining pattern further  revealed that i-Extract, fraction F1, fraction F4 and i-Factor caused an  abrogation of mortalin-p53 interactions and reactivation of p53 function while  the fractions F2, F3, F5 work through other mechanisms.",Is Ashwagandha effective in preventing or treating cancer?,"So, I've heard Ashwagandha might be good for general health, but does it have any benefits in preventing cancer or is that just a myth?",I've heard that Ashwagandha is good for overall health.

321,"OBJECTIVE: Ayurvedic formulations are preferred over other formulations as well  as commercialized on broad level to treat various ailments. The World Health  Organization has established certain guidelines for quality control of heavy  metals and pesticide residues. Bacopa monnieri, a popular herb with  immunomodulator and memory-enhancing properties is the chief constituent of  several Ayurvedic formulations, which include Brahmi Vati (BV), Brahmi Ghrita  (BG) and Saraswat Churna (SC), etc. In view of the World Health Organization  guidelines, two products of each formulation from six different manufacturers  were purchased from Ayurvedic Pharmacy, Bulanala-Varanasi, India for testing  heavy metal and pesticide residue. METHODS: In the present study, all the formulations--BV, BG and SC--were  selected for estimation of four heavy metals namely lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd),  chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) by a plasma emission spectrophotometer.  Organochlorine pesticidal residues were estimated for dichlorodiphenyl  trichloroethane, isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and α-endosulfan, etc.  in total 12 samples of test formulations containing Bacopa monnieri L. using gas  chromatography technique. RESULTS: Out of 12 samples, Pb, Cd, Cr and Ni were present in all samples but  below the permissible limit. Although atrazine, aldrin, dialdrin were in below  detection limit, but other pesticides were detected in some samples as oxamyl,  hexachlorocyclohexanes (α-HCH, β-HCH and γ-HCH), dichlorodiphenyl  trichloroethane and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene. CONCLUSION: The presence of heavy metals in the formulations was low to cause  toxicity.

323,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, India's natural health care tradition, has a unique way of  classifying human population based on individual constitution or prakriti.  Ayurveda's tridosha theory identifies principles of motion (vata), metabolism  (pitta), and structure (kapha) as discrete phenotypic groupings. Patwardhan et  al. (2005) hypothesized in a paper published in this journal that there is a  genetic connotation to prakriti and as proof of this concept showed a  correlation between HLA alleles and prakriti type, establishing a rationale and  preliminary experimental support for the concept of an association between HLA  alleles and the Ayurvedic tridosha theory of individual prakriti types. This  work is both part of and a catalyst for a wider revolution in the scientific  investigation of Ayurveda in India, referred to as ""Ayurvedic biology"" and  ""AyuGenomics."" Subsequently, Chen et al. (2007) reported a similar study in this  journal using a classification based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)  theory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of a genetic basis for both Ayurvedic and TCM  classifications indicate a commonality between Asia's great medical traditions  in their diagnostic typologies and a genetic basis for Asian traditional  medicine's theory of discrete and discernable groupings of psycho-physiologic  differences. Accordingly, new horizons have opened for collaborative East-East  research and for an individualized approach to disease management and activation  of the full range of human potential, as articulated in Ayurveda and TCM.",Can Ayurveda provide a personalized approach to managing my health based on my genetic makeup?,"So, I heard there's some sort of link between my genes and these Ayurvedic body types.

324,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This review explores the link between Type 2  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and diabetes-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). It  emphasizes the shared pathophysiological links and mechanisms between the two  conditions, focusing on reduced insulin levels and receptors, impaired glucose  metabolism, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative damage  in AD-affected brains-paralleling aspects of T2DM. The review suggests AD as a  ""diabetes of the brain,"" supported by cognitive enhancement through antidiabetic  interventions. It focuses on the traditionally used Indian herbs as a means to  manage both conditions while addressing developmental challenges. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study explores the DM-AD connection, reviewing medicinal  herbs with protective potential for both ailments, considering traditional uses  and developmental challenges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studied research, reviews, and ethnobotanical and  scientific data from electronic databases and traditional books. RESULTS: The study analyzes the pathophysiological links between DM and AD,  emphasizing their interconnected factors. Eight Ayurvedic plants with dual  protective effects against T2DM and AD are thoroughly reviewed with  preclinical/clinical evidence. Historical context, phytoconstituents, and  traditional applications are explored. Innovative formulations using these  plants are examined. Challenges stemming from phytoconstituents' physicochemical  properties are highlighted, prompting novel formulation development, including  nanotechnology-based delivery systems. The study uncovers obstacles in  formulating treatments for these diseases. CONCLUSION: The review showcases the dual potential of chosen medicinal herbs  against both diseases, along with their traditional applications, endorsing  their use. It addresses formulation obstacles, proposing innovative delivery  technologies for herbal therapies, while acknowledging their constraints.

326,"OBJECTIVES: Madhulai Manappagu - a well-known sastric and widely prescribed  Siddha herbal syrup formulation indicated for treating Veluppu Noi (Anaemia  especially Iron deficiency Anaemia) has been in day today practice in Tamil Nadu  for a quite longer decades. The syrup is a herbal preparation which has a sweet  pleasant odour and a palatable taste, contain the juice of pomegranate (Punica  granatum L.) as the main ingredient. Though the formulation is a fruit juice,  the safety profile of the syrup is not established and is being marketed without  toxicological evaluation. The study is aimed at ascertaining the acute and  sub-acute toxicity assessment of Madhulai Manappagu in Wistar Albino rats. METHODS: The acute and sub-acute (28day repeated oral) toxicity studies were  performed as per the guidelines mentioned in the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) 423 (adopted on December 2001) and TG 407  (adopted on October 2008) with slight modifications respectively. For acute  toxicity study, three female rats were randomly selected as control; three  female rats were randomly selected and were administered a single dose of  5,000 mg/kg body weight per oral route. For sub-acute (28day repeated oral)  toxicity studies, three doses of test drug MM of 500 mg/kg/day (low dose),  750 mg/kg/day (intermittent dose) and 1,000 mg/kg/day (high dose) were selected  for administration. Both sexes of Wistar Albino rats were randomized into four  groups of 10 animals each (five males, five females). Group I was kept as  control group. Group II, III and IV served as low, intermittent and high doses  of MM respectively. Animals were observed for mortality, morbidity, body weight  changes, feed and water intake. Haematology, clinical biochemistry,  electrolytes, gross pathology, relative organ weight and histopathological  examination were performed. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity study, rats showed no toxicological signs on  behavior, gross pathology and body weight of rats when treated with a single  dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight per oral route. In the subacute (28 days  repeated oral) toxicity study, rats have showed no significant changes on  behavior, gross pathology, body weight, and hematological and biochemical  parameters when treated with Madhulai Manappagu in three different doses. CONCLUSIONS: The toxicity studies which include both acute and 28 days repeated  (subacute) oral toxicity studies, revealed no observed adverse effect level  (NOAEL) of Madhulai Manappagu in animals.

327,"Pueraria tuberosa (Willd.) DC is a perennial herb commonly known as  'vidarikanda', distributed throughout south east Asia. The plant's tuber is  widely used in ethanomedicine as well as in traditional systems of medicine,  particularly in ayurveda. It has been used in various ayurvedic formulations as  restorative tonic, antiaging, spermatogenic and immune booster and has been  recommended for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, hepatosplenomegaly,  fertility disorders, menopausal syndrome, sexual debility and spermatorrhoea.  Numerous bioactive phytochemicals, mostly isoflavonoids such as puerarin,  genistein, daidzein, tuberosin and so on have been identified in the tuber. In  vivo and in vitro studies have provided the support against traditional demands  of the tuber as spermatogenic, immune booster, aphrodisiac, anti-inflammatory,  cardiotonic and brain tonic.

329,"Recent research on causes of disease and aging has increasingly supported the  importance of stress. One theory of the relationship between stress and disease  is based on the concept of homeostasis, a term coined by Cannon over 50 years  ago to signify those states and mechanisms responsible for the ""staying power of  the body"". Bernard, Cannon, Selye and other leading researchers held that full,  normal function of the self-regulating or homeostatic power of the body  maintains the balanced, integrated condition we recognize as health. Failures in  this capacity, such as those produced by frequent stressful experiences, can  result in disease or death. Theories of health and disease surprisingly similar  to this have existed since ancient times, and in widely different cultures. This  review discusses both the fundamental elements of these theories and the current  neuroendocrine research supporting their validity and immediate relevance. The  connections between ancient and modern knowledge described herein were made  possible largely by the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a scholar and teacher of  the ancient vedic tradition of India. A key part of Ayurveda that has been  obscure to modern science is the substance ""ojas"", which the classical texts say  maintains balance of the physiology. In this article, specific steroids or  steroid classes are proposed as likely candidates for both the ""ordinary"" and  the ""superior"" types of ojas described in Ayurveda. Current evidence for the  functions of these steroids, as well as their role in stress, disease and the  maintenance of health, is reviewed. The knowledge of Ayurveda, as recently  brought to light by Maharishi, includes methods for recovering and maintaining  optimal function of steroidal systems.

337,"BACKGROUND: Presbycusis is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both  ears at high frequencies, which affects more than half of the older adults by  the age of 75 years and is often accompanied by tinnitus and cognitive  deterioration. Unfortunately, there are no treatments available to restore  hearing loss. Treatment mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and  communication with hearing aids. Traditional medicine like Ayurveda also  explains ailments of a similar nature as Badhirya and advises using drugs with  antiaging and neuroprotective activity for treatment. In Ayurveda, Badhirya and  Karnanada (senile deafness with tinnitus) are due to vitiation of Vata Dosha.  Treatments such as topical oil pooling (Karnapurana) are usually advised to  counter Vata, improve hearing capacity, and reduce tinnitus. Kshirabala Taila, a  medicated oil formulation prepared with Sida cordifolia Linnaeus, is one of the  most preferred oils for topical oil pooling in such conditions, as it has a  definitive indication for sensory dysfunctions. Drugs like Withania somnifera  (L.) Dunal (Ashwagandha) are also used, as they ameliorate neurodegeneration and  help to improve cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: We propose an exploratory randomized controlled trial study for  evaluating the efficacy of TOPMAC (Topical Oil Pooling with Kshirabala Taila and  Supplementation of Ashwagandha Churna) in tinnitus suppression and hearing and  cognitive function protection in patients aged 60-75 years with mild to moderate  presbycusis. METHODS: A parallel, 2-group, exploratory randomized controlled trial will be  conducted in an Indian Ayurvedic research center at its outpatient service.  Participants (N=60) with mild to moderate presbycusis will be recruited by  screening. Participants will be randomized (computer-generated 1:1) to receive  either basic treatment and health education (BTHE) or BTHE+TOPMAC for 24 weeks.  The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in  the protection of hearing function. The secondary objective is to compare the  efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in tinnitus suppression and cognitive  function protection. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2023. The institutional ethics  committees at National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma  (3/1/2020/NARIP/Tech/2036) and Institute for Communicative and Cognitive Neuro  Sciences (IEC006) approved this study. The first patient was enrolled in  September 2023; 22 participants were enrolled as of August 2024. The data  analysis is yet to start, and the results are expected to be published by  January 2025. CONCLUSIONS: If this exploratory trial is proven effective, it will steer the  setting of a definitive randomized controlled trial to test whether the TOPMAC  intervention can be incorporated as a cost-effective integrative approach for  managing presbycusis. The Indian government has already launched a National  Program for Prevention and Control of Deafness to benefit the deaf population.

338,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sri Lanka has rich traditional systems of  medicine, which cater to 60-70% of the rural population׳s primary health care  needs. However, development of existing systems has been hindered by the  unavailability of up-to-date information on medicinal materials and other  related issues. For streamlining purposes, we investigated the present-day  scenario of country׳s medicinal plant industry by gathering up-to-date  information on the types of raw materials required, their aggregate quantities,  heavily used and rare materials, family wise distribution, challenges faced by  stakeholders as well as other pertinent issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present survey covered the selected government  Ayurveda hospitals, traditional and Ayurveda practitioners, large and  small-scale herbal drug and cosmetic manufactures, importers, collectors and  Ayurveda commissioners throughout the country. A systematic questionnaire was  distributed and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Collected data were  tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: A diverse range of medicinal materials, including 290 species (64.73%)  from dried plants, 59 (13.17%) from fresh plants, 69 (15.40%) from minerals, 18  (4.02%) from animal sources and 12 (2.68%) from other sources were recorded. A  total of 302 plant species belonging to 95 families, dominated by Leguminosae  family, was listed. Out of these, 46 species belonging to 35 families were used  intensively. A large portion of herbal materials was of completely local origin  (71.13%) while 26% were imported and the rest (2.87%) can be obtained by both  routes. Leaves were the most highly used part of the plant (22.2%). High price,  poor quality, insufficient or totally absence of continuous supply and  adulteration were the main constraints faced by the stakeholders. The  unavailability of systematic cultivation and processing protocols, incorrect  identification, and lack of proper quality control methodologies were identified  as major challenges of the industry.

340,"Withaferin A (hereafter abbreviated as WA) is a promising anticancer steroidal  lactone abundant in a medicinal plant (Withania somnifera) native to Asia. The  root/leaf extract of Withania somnifera, which belongs to the Solanaceae family,  continues to be included in the Ayurvedic medicine formulations of alternative  medicine practice. Numerous chemicals are detectable in the root/leaf extract of  Withania somnifera [e.g., withanolides (WA, withanone, withanolide A, etc.),  alkaloids, sitoindosides, etc.], but the anticancer effect of this medicinal  plant is largely attributed to WA. Anticancer effect of WA was initially  reported in the early 70s in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell model in vitro Since  then, numerous preclinical studies have been performed using cellular and animal  models of different cancers including breast cancer to determine cancer  therapeutic and chemopreventive effects of WA. Chemoprevention, a word first  introduced by Dr. Michael B. Sporn, was intended to impede, arrest, or reverse  carcinogenesis at its earliest stages with pharmacologic agents. This review  succinctly summarizes the published findings on anticancer pharmacology of WA in  breast cancer focusing on pharmacokinetic behavior, in vivo efficacy data in  preclinical models in a therapeutic and chemoprevention settings, and its known  effects on cancer-relevant cellular processes (e.g., growth arrest, apoptosis  induction, autophagy, metabolic adaptation, immune function, etc.) and molecular  targets (e.g., suppression of oncogenes such as estrogen receptor-α, STAT3,  etc.).

341,"BACKGROUND: Constant exposure to various stressors, such as immune pressure,  rapidly increasing population, deleterious changes in the ecosystem, climate  change, infection with emerging and re-emerging pathogens, and fast-paced  lifestyle, is a critical factor in the globally increasing incidences of  immunocompromising health conditions, as well as stress. Synthetic  chemotherapeutic agents, which are widely available in the commercial market,  may be highly efficacious, but most are immunosuppressive and exert many side  effects. METHODS: Herein, we comprehensively reviewed current literature from various  scientific databases such as Bentham Science, PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier,  Springer, etc. The inclusion/exclusion criteria based on literature with high  importance was adopted to analyze and compile salient information from the  authentic bibliographic sources. RESULTS: Undoubtedly, the pivotal characteristics of immunostimulants and  immunomodulators in the maintenance of the health and productivity of humans, as  well as animals, cannot be overlooked. Numerous herbs used in ethnoveterinary  medicine can be successfully employed as adjuvant rehabilitators to negate the  deleterious effects of chemotherapeutics. The sources of these medicinal  remedies are part of long traditions in different regions of the world, such as  Indian Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, which have been developed  through empirical experience. Traditional medicine employs a holistic approach  to the prevention of disease, and traditional herbal medicines are a source of  many components with a high therapeutic value that are used in modern allopathic  medicine. Globally, many studies have been conducted on these herbs and have  revealed unique active constituents that activate the innate immune system  through the stimulation of macrophages and lymphocytes, and modulation of the  cytokine profile, which leads to a state of alertness with a subsequent  reduction in the incidence of infection. Immunomodulatory constituents with  herbal origins are termed as phytochemicals, including flavonoids, glycosides,  polysaccharides, terpenoids, essential oils, various bitters, and alkaloids; all  these compounds exert vital, multidimensional effects. Efforts have focused on  screening plant preparations to identify adjuvant immune properties;  furthermore, several potent phytol adjuvants have been experimentally proven to  downregulate inflammatory reactions in addition to enhance specific adaptive  responses to vaccines.

342,"Chronic joint inflammatory disorders like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis, which are manifested by joint dysfunction, show an upsurge in  inflammation and oxidative stress. Although conventional anti-arthritic drugs  are being used to relieve pain from arthritic symptoms, they usually cause  severe side effects. Traditionally used Ayurvedic medicinal plants are a  promising alternative for the management of arthritic symptoms, as they are safe  and effective. Ayurvedic medicinal plants improve arthritic symptoms by reducing  joint tenderness, joint pain, swelling, bone and cartilage damage, and  increasing knee flexion, walking distance and sports activities. These  beneficial effects of Ayurvedic medicinal plants on arthritis are mediated  through various cellular mechanisms including inhibition of the inflammatory  markers NF-κB, cytokines, adipokines, PGE2, NO, iNOS, COX-2, and MMPs and  induction of antioxidant status by decreasing free radicals, lipid peroxidation,  and myeloperoxidase, and increasing antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2, and HO-1. Thus, a  strategy requires using these Ayurvedic medicinal plants to treat arthritis.  This article describes the status of inflammation and oxidative stress in  arthritic conditions. We also provide evidence that Ayurvedic medicinal plants  and their bioactive components are highly effective in improving arthritic  symptoms.",How can Ayurvedic medicinal plants help manage arthritis symptoms?,My grandma has arthritis and she struggles a lot with joint pain.

343,"BACKGROUND: Triphala (Sanskrit tri = three and phala = fruits), composed of the  three medicinal fruits Phyllanthus emblica L. or Emblica officinalis Gaertn.,  Terminalia chebula Retz., and Terminalia belerica Retz. is an important herbal  preparation in the traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda. Triphala is  an antioxidant-rich herbal formulation and possesses diverse beneficial  properties. It is a widely prescribed Ayurvedic drug and is used as a colon  cleanser, digestive, diuretic, and laxative. Cancer is a major cause of death,  and globally studies are being conducted to prevent cancer or to develop  effective nontoxic therapeutic agents. Experimental studies in the past decade  have shown that Triphala is useful in the prevention of cancer and that it also  possesses antineoplastic, radioprotective and chemoprotective effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review for the first time summarizes these results, with  emphasis on published observations. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms  responsible for the beneficial effects and lacunas in the existing knowledge  that need to be bridged are also discussed.",What are the potential benefits of Triphala in cancer prevention?,I've been hearing a lot about this Triphala stuff in Ayurveda.

345,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, an ancient medical science originating in India, also is  practiced in the United States. The authors conducted a study primarily to  explore the involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in treating oral diseases. METHODS: Eighty-five practitioners participated in this cross-sectional survey.  The authors obtained self-reported data on demographics of the practitioners,  the general and oral health conditions they treated, and the treatment  modalities used. They performed descriptive statistical and logistic regression  analyses by using statistical software. RESULTS: Participants predominantly were female and white or non-Hispanic, as  well as part-time practitioners. Their educational backgrounds ranged from a  5½-year bachelor's degree in Ayurveda to short-term training. Of the 60  respondents who answered the question about treating oral diseases, 25 (42  percent) reported that they did so. Conditions treated were related to oral  malodor, gingival or periodontal disease and toothache. Ayurvedic treatments  administered for these conditions primarily were preventive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic practitioners in the United States treat a variety of  oral diseases by using predominantly preventive traditional care. Ayurvedic  practitioners of Asian origin and those who practiced for a longer duration were  more likely to report that they treated oral diseases. Larger, population-based  studies are needed to understand more fully the current role of Ayurvedic  practitioners in oral health care. Ayurvedic treatment modalities aimed at oral  diseases need to be evaluated through rigorous randomized controlled trials for  safety and effectiveness. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients with limited or no access to oral health care  might seek Ayurvedic treatment, and those who have access to conventional oral  health care might wish to complement it with Ayurvedic treatment. Practitioners  can incorporate preventive Ayurvedic treatments, which are based mainly on  natural products, into overall preventive care regimens, if proven safe and  effective.",What kind of oral health issues can be treated with Ayurvedic practices?,"I've been having some toothaches and gum problems, do you think Ayurvedic treatments could help with my oral health issues?",I've been having some trouble with my gums and toothaches.

Ex vivo natural killer (NK)  cell activity was assessed after consumption of fortified tea compared with  regular tea in two independent double-blind intervention studies. Both studies  were conducted in India with healthy volunteers (age >or= 55 years) selected for  a relatively low baseline NK cell activity and a history of recurrent coughs and  colds. In a pilot study conducted with 32 volunteers, the consumption of Natural  Care tea significantly improved the NK cell activity of the volunteers in  comparison with a population consuming regular tea. These results were validated  in an independent crossover study with 110 volunteers.

351,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lauha bhasma (iron ash) is one of the iron-based  herbo-metallic preparations used in Ayurvedic medicine for treating various  ailments due to iron deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preparation of Lauha bhasma (iron ash) requires  normal purification (heat treatment in vegetable and animal products), special  purification (treatment with herbal constituents) and calcination steps aimed at  converting the raw material to a suitable therapeutic form. In this study, we  have systematically and scientifically evaluated through a series of qualitative  tests and modern analytical tools the importance of the treating media. RESULTS: Our data demonstrates that these steps are necessary to remove the  grease and scales in the raw material. While heating, microcracks appeared on  the surface of the iron, which improved the reactivity with the herbal  constituents in addition to incorporating nanostructured features. Further, the  use of plant products facilitated the removal of Fe³⁺ present in the raw  material by forming soluble complexes. The Fe²⁺ present in the raw materials  also forms an insoluble complex with the herbal constituents in the presence of  UV radiation.

353,"Suvarna Bhasma (SB) is a gold particle-based medicine that is used in Ayurved to  treat tuberculosis, arthritis and nervous diseases. Traditionally, the Ayurved  preparation processes of SB do exist, but they are all long, tedious and involve  several steps. Due to this, there is a possibility of bypassing the necessary  Ayurved processes or non-adherence to all steps or use of synthetic gold  particles. Our aim is to characterize 5 commercial SB preparations from 5  different manufacturers. A comparative physicochemical, pharmacokinetic (PK) and  bioaccumulation study was carried out on all the 5 SB preparations. The general  appearance such as color and texture of these 5 samples were different from each  other. The size, shape and gold concentration (from 32-98 wt%) varied among all  the 5 SBs. The accumulation of ionic gold in zebrafish and gold concentration  profiles in rat blood were found to be significantly different for all the 5  SBs. Non-compartmental PK model obtained from the concentration-time profile  showed significant differences in various PK parameters such as peak  concentration (Cmax), half-life (t1/2) and terminal elimination slope (λz) for  all the 5 SB preparations. SB-B showed the highest Cmax (8.55 μg/L), whereas  SB-D showed the lowest Cmax (4.66 μg/L). The dissolution of ionic gold from SBs  in zebrafish tissue after the oral dose had a 5.5-fold difference between the  highest and lowest ionic gold concentrations. All the 5 samples showed distinct  physicochemical and biological properties.

358,"OBJECTIVE: The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, is the oldest  scientifically based system of medicine in the world. According to Ayurvedic  concepts, there are 3 humors or Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The combination  of these Doshas in varying degrees leads to one's constitution, referred to as  Prakruti. Prakruti determines one's physical, physiologic, and mental character  and disease vulnerability. This clinical study was undertaken to determine the  constitutional typing of individuals with known idiopathic Parkinson's disease  (PD) compared with that of nonparkinsonian controls. This study sought to  validate the ancient observation that persons of Vata Prakruti are at risk for  nervous system diseases. PD was used as a test case because the exact cause is  not known. METHODS: Patients with established PD (n=75) and closely related controls with  no known neurologic disease (n=73) were assessed for their Ayurvedic  constitution (Prakruti). An Ayurvedic constitutional assessment form and an  independent Ayurvedic clinical assessment were used in the patients and  controls. RESULTS: The total mean score (±standard deviation) for Vata was 11.0±3.9 in  patients with PD and 6.9±3.0 in controls. This finding was significant  (p<0.0001), indicating that the incidence of PD is highest in those with Vata  Prakruti. The incidence of PD was higher in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gained from this study may be helpful in identifying the  vulnerable population, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing disease  progression or development of treatment-related complications by keeping Vata in  balance through anti-Vata diet and lifestyle changes as prescribed in Ayurveda.",What lifestyle changes can I make according to Ayurveda to help delay the onset of Parkinson's disease if I have a Vata constitution?,"So, I heard about this Ayurvedic stuff and these things called Doshas.

We evaluate cross-system practice from its legal and ethical perspectives.  Across judgments, the judiciary has held that cross-system practice is a form of  medical negligence; however, it is permitted only in those states where the  concerned governments have authorized it by a general or special order. Further,  though a state government may authorize an alternative medicine doctor to  prescribe allopathic medicines (or vice versa), it does not condone the  prescription of wrong medicines or wrong diagnosis. Courts have also stated that  prescribing allopathic medicines and misrepresenting these as traditional  medicines is an unfair trade practice and not explaining the side-effects of a  prescribed allopathic medicine amounts to medical negligence. Finally, the  Supreme Court has cautioned that employing traditional medical practitioners who  do not possess the required skill and competence to give allopathic treatment in  hospitals and to let an emergency patient be treated by them is gross  negligence. In the event of an unwanted outcome, the responsibility is  completely on the hospital authorities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to  abolish cross-system practice, invest in healthcare, and bring radical changes  in health legislations to make right to healthcare a reality.",What are the potential risks of a traditional medicine practitioner prescribing allopathic medicines?,"So, I've been hearing about this thing where alternative medicine doctors can also prescribe regular medicines.

361,"Anorexia and cachexia are major clinical problems seen in a large proportion of  patients with advanced cancer. Weight loss has also been identified as an  indicator of poor prognosis in cancer patients. Around 20% of patients with  advanced cancer present mortality from the effects of malnutrition rather than  from cancer itself. Early nutrition intervention has seen to improve outcomes in  cancer patients such as weight gain, treatment tolerance, and improved quality  of life (QoL).

362,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda is an ancient system of personalized medicine documented  and practiced in India since 1500 B.C. According to this system an individual's  basic constitution to a large extent determines predisposition and prognosis to  diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime. Ayurveda describes seven  broad constitution types (Prakritis) each with a varying degree of  predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting  types, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of  modern predictive medicine, efforts are being directed towards capturing disease  phenotypes with greater precision for successful identification of markers for  prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the different  constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates. METHODS: Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types  were identified following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian  population of Indo-European origin. The peripheral blood samples of these  individuals were analysed for genome wide expression levels, biochemical and  hematological parameters. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway based analysis was  carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were  significant enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types. RESULTS: Individuals from the three most contrasting constitutional types  exhibit striking differences with respect to biochemical and hematological  parameters and at genome wide expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver  function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological parameters like haemoglobin  exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of genes  showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched  in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent  protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation. A  significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were  observed in these extreme constitution types. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme  constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system  level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease  predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical  phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern  biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise  for future predictive medicine.",Can the principles of Ayurveda help predict disease predisposition?,"So, Ayurveda suggests that our health is linked to our specific body type. Does this mean certain people are more likely to get certain diseases because of their body type?",Can my Ayurveda constitution type indicate any potential health risks I should be aware of?
363,"This paper focuses on the worldview hypotheses and research design approaches  from nonlinear dynamical complex systems (NDS) science that can inform future  studies of whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WS-CAM),  e.g., Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and homeopathy. The worldview  hypotheses that underlie NDS and WS-CAM (contextual, organismic,  interactive-integrative - Pepper, 1942) overlap with each other, but differ  fundamentally from those of biomedicine (formistic, mechanistic). Differing  views on the nature of causality itself lead to different types of study  designs. Biomedical efficacy studies assume a simple direct mechanistic  cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily  outcome, an assumption less relevant to WS-CAM outcomes. WS-CAM practitioners do  not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Rather, they intervene to modulate an  intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and to create a more  favorable environmental context for the emergence of health, e.g., with dietary  changes compatible with the constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system  thereby fosters the emergence of indirect, diffuse, complex effects throughout  the person and the person's interactions with his/her environment. NDS  theory-driven study designs thus have the potential for greater external and  model validity than biomedically driven efficacy studies (e.g., clinical trials)  for evaluating the indirect effects of WS-CAM practices. Potential applications  of NDS analytic techniques to WS-CAM include characterizing different  constitutional types and documenting the evolution and dynamics of whole-person  healing and well-being over time.

367,"INTRODUCTION: Hemiplegia and the Ayurvedic description of ardhanga disease  presents with comparable clinical features. This pilot trial compared two  traditional procedure-based treatments: Navarakizhi, a massage of cooked navara  rice in a medicated hot bolus, and pinda sweda, a similar massage made of a  different type of rice. This article also describes the steps of a double-blind  trial in Ayurveda, which was hitherto considered difficult to perform. METHODS: Eighteen (18) patients suffering from hemiplegia with disease duration  of 6 months to 2 years received treatment with navarakizhi or pinda sweda for 7  days. Both groups received the same Ayurvedic oral medications for 14 days. All  steps of randomization and blinding of procedure-based therapy in Ayurveda are  described. The physiotherapist evaluated muscle tone, muscle strength, tendon  reflexes, range of movement, and balance of functional abilities at baseline, 7  days, and 14 days after starting therapy. Both patient and the assessing  physiotherapist were blinded. RESULTS: Intraquartile range values showed better range in patients who received  navarakizhi than those who received pinda sweda. DISCUSSION: A larger trial is needed to confirm the superiority of navarakizhi  over the rice varieties in treating hemiplegia. This study demonstrates that  double-blind randomized clinical trials are possible in Ayurvedic settings,  ending the long-debated controversy in trial methodology involving  procedure-based traditional medicines.",What are some Ayurvedic treatments for hemiplegia?,I've heard about Ayurvedic treatments for muscle issues.

369,"Universal health coverage (UHC) in the Indian context is understood as easily  accessible and affordable health services for all citizens. The Planning  Commission of India constituted a High Level Expert Group (HLEG) in October 2010  for the purpose of drafting the guidelines of UHC. While the primary focus of  UHC is to provide financial protection to all citizens, its delivery requires an  adequate health infrastructure, skilled health human resources, and access to  affordable drugs and technologies so that all people receive the level and  quality of care they are entitled to. This paper attempts to link the ayurveda,  yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH) systems of medicine  with UHC. Here, the AYUSH system refers to the AYUSH workforce, therapeutics and  principles, and their individual role in delivering UHC to the citizens of  India. In outlining the role of AYUSH, the paper lays stress on the 10 guiding  principles of UHC, as proposed by the HLEG.

370,"BACKGROUND: Specific treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Outcomes of  clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success. Therefore,  it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against  COVID-19. PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian  Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical  trial. METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide  Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of  Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India.  1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional  herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)  and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in  treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of  tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in  powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30  min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu  taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast.  Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post  randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the  detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of  study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was  used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-α) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day  7 of the study. RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and  placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100 % recovery by day 7,  while it was 60.0 % in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels  of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20  times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40 % absolute  reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in  faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination.  Reduced inflammation markers suggested less severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in  the treatment group. Moreover, there was no adverse effect observed to be  associated with this treatment.",Can Ayurvedic treatment help in faster recovery from COVID-19 infection?,"So, I heard there's no specific treatment for COVID-19 yet, but I saw something about Ayurvedic treatments helping with recovery.

373,"Formulations from the traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, have long been  considered to have potent life-style enhancing effects, possibly by their  effect(s) on key life-history attributes. Although several studies have reported  beneficial effects of these formulations on different components of life  history, few have investigated their concurrent influence on various  life-history traits. Here, we report the results of an investigation showing the  effect of two well-known Ayurvedic formulations, Guduchi and Madhuyashti, on  fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were either grown  (i.e., larval exposure) and/or maintained (i.e., adult exposure) on standard  food supplemented with 0.5% Guduchi or 0.5% Madhuyashti. It was observed that  the longevity of adult flies of both sexes was not affected on feeding  Guduchifood, but fecundity of the females was greatly enhanced. Fecundity was  also found to be affected by the adult food and whether their mates were grown  on Guduchi or normal food. Madhuyashti, on the other hand, significantly reduced  mean longevity and had a stimulatory effect on female fecundity. This fecundity  enhancing effect however seemed to be mediated through its effect on the males.  Interestingly, much of these effects interacted with age in a complex way,  making it difficult to generalize the overall effect of these formulations on  the reproductive output of the flies. Ourstudy underlines the importance of  evaluating the interacting effects of these (and similar) formulations on a  range of life-history traits in a holistic way to understand their utility  better.",Can Ayurvedic formulations like Guduchi and Madhuyashti enhance longevity and fertility?,I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine like Guduchi and Madhuyashti.

374,"Background: Ayurveda, the traditional Indian therapeutic system, involves herbs  and spices as drug ingredients and a kind of food intake regulation. The health  and curative aspects of plant products are often ascribed to their antimicrobial  and antioxidant activities (AA). However, it seems somewhat possible to  correlate the AA of herbal extracts or plant isolates with their phenolic  contents (PC). Objective: Indian researchers have carried out some tests for the  determination of AA and PC of plant products that are worth mentioning. Methods:  Among the herbal analysis techniques, the important contributions of Indians and  people of Indian origin in this field include the remarkable separation of  phenolic compounds, including the use of reversed-phase columns, on-line HPLC,  the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay to effectively screen and  identify antioxidant compounds from herbal extracts, and other chromatographic,  spectrographic, and spectroscopic techniques, in the analysis of complex  biological matrices. Results: The aim of this paper is to present an overview of  such arguments with reference to herbal drugs and food intake regulation for  specific ailments. Conclusions: The lack of uniformity in the use of test  protocols for antioxidant assays (particularly using the DPPH free radical) and  differences in in vitro mechanisms of antiradical activity and in vivo  metabolism of polyphenols have been the issues associated with these experiments  that have been raised by researchers in the period from 2000 onward.",What are some benefits of using herbs and spices in Ayurveda for maintaining health?,"So, I've heard that certain herbs and spices can be good for my health.

375,"OBJECTIVES: While the introduction of biomedicine within the Sri Lankan  healthcare system has resulted in reduced reliance on traditional, complementary  and alternative medicine (TCAM) over the last century in Sri Lanka, treatment  modalities such as Ayurveda, Sinhala and traditional religious practices still  receive considerable public support. Cancer is an increasing burden in Sri  Lanka, and whilst Sri Lankans are known to use TCAM for everyday ailments, there  has been no research examining the role of TCAM in the context of cancer. The  aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of TCAM use by  cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were obtained from two Sri Lankan hospitals using a consecutive  convenience sample of 500 cancer patients currently receiving biomedical  treatment, over a 10-week period in 2008. RESULTS: Analyses showed that 67.4% of those surveyed used one or more TCAM in  conjunction with biomedicine for cancer treatment. The most common were Sinhala,  Ayurveda and traditional religious practices. Of those patients who used TCAM,  95.0% gave the main reason for usage as 'they thought it would cure their  cancer'. The strongest reason for not using TCAM was on advice from their doctor  (80.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The high use of TCAM amongst cancer patients in Sri Lanka raises  numerous important issues, including those related to patient safety, potential  benefit, interactions with biomedical cancer treatments, and delays in seeking  biomedical cancer care. Further research is needed to explore the  decision-making processes of cancer patients, including the perceived  benefits/limitations of key processes in biomedical and TCAM care.",What traditional or alternative treatments are commonly used by cancer patients in Sri Lanka?,"Do people in Sri Lanka really use traditional remedies to treat cancer, and why do they believe it could work?",I've been diagnosed with cancer and I'm curious about natural treatments.

Chromatography of methanolic extracts of these  formulations was performed on silica gel 60 F254 aluminum-backed TLC plates of  0.2 mm layer thickness. The plate was developed up to 66 mm with the  ternary-mobile phase butanol-acetic acid-water (8 + 1 + 1, v/v/v) at 33 +/- 5  degrees C with 5 min of tank saturation. The marker, berberine, was quantified  at its maximum absorbance of 350 nm. The limit of detection and limit of  quantitation values were found to be 5 and 10 ng/spot. The linear regression  analysis data for the calibration plot showed a good linear relationship with  correlation coefficient = 0.9994 in the concentration range of 10 to 50 ng/spot  for berberine with respect to peak area. The instrumental precision was found to  be 0.49% coefficient of variation (CV), and repeatability of the method was  0.73% CV. Recovery values from 98.27 to 99.11% indicate excellent accuracy of  the method.

377,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal Plant resources of forest origin are  extensively used in India for various systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani,  Homeopathy, Allopathy, Siddha and Ethnic etc. The tribal communities around the  Kakrajhore forest in West Medinipur district of West Bengal have their own  traditional knowledge based system of curing many diseases using the forest  based plant resources similar to ayurveda. The forest comprises of one of the  unique treasure and rich source of diversified ethno-botanical wealth and  therefore extensive studies is required for proper documentation including  ethnomedicinal knowledge of local tribes. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was initiated with an aim to inventorize the  ayurvedic medicinal plant recourses and explore the traditional knowledge of  tribal people of Kakrajhore forest to treat several diseases along with the  sustainable management and conservation of medicinal plants. METHODS: The information on the medicinal plant resources were gathered through  floristic inventorization with proper sampling method in the study area  (N22°42'57.05″, E86°34'58.02″) during the year 2015. For floristic  inventorization the study area of 312 ha was delineated by using GPS Receiver.  Then total mapped area was divided by virtual grid of 100m apart in both  East-West and North-South direction to allocate 60 sample plots by random  sampling. In addition to inventorization, the use value (UV) of the species was  determined and the informant consensus factor (ICF) was calculated for the  medicinal plants found in the study area based on personal interview. Further  exploration was carried out to establish linkage with Ayurveda. RESULTS: The present survey has identified 57 numbers of ethno-medicinal plants  belonging to 39 families, used for preparing medicinal remedies. The habit of  the plants includes 35% trees, 28% shrubs, 23% herbs and 14% climbers. The most  frequently utilized plant parts were the Roots & Tuber roots (26%), Stem which  includes Bark, Tubers, Bulb, Rhizome, Gum, Wood & Young shoots (24%), Leaves  (18%), Fruits (13%), and Seeds (10%). The most frequent happening ailments are  asthma and bronchitis, constipation and dyspepsia, diarrhea, dysentery, ulcer,  rheumatism, arthritis, fistula and piles troubles. Most of the Plants (88%) had  more than a single therapeutic use. The most important plant species on the  basis of use value were Smilex ovalifolia, Emblica officinalis, Curculigo  orchioides, Croton roxburghii, Asparagus racemosus, Ziziphus nummularia,  Ichnocarpus frutescens, Cisssus adnata, Buettneria herbacea, Litsea glutinosa,  Vernonia anthelmintica and Chlorophytum borivilianum. There was a strong  agreement among the informants related to the usage of the plants (ICF  0.65-0.93). As per the standard literature in Ayurveda, maximum numbers of  documented species (33) are found to be used for 'digestive system disorder'  which is analogous to ethnomedicinal use (30), followed by 'skin related  problem' i.e. 13 and 20 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that people living around Kakrajhore forest area hold  valuable knowledge of the uses of plant resources and some of the ayurvedic  plants represent an important component in local livelihood. Though the  Kakrajhore Forest area is rich in medicinal plant resources but the species are  susceptible to be endangered by intense exploitation by human communities.

Besides, finding place as health supplements,  nutraceuticals, cosmetics, herbal tea etc. there has been a global insurgence of  interest, including India, leading to enormous research/activities in the area  of medicinal plants. AIM OF THE STUDY: The article is aimed to provide the effort and initiatives of  ICMR towards research on medicinal plants and its contributions on consolidation  of Indian research on medicinal plants that are very relevant and important in  the national context. METHODS: The various initiatives undertaken by ICMR on research on traditional  medicines/medicinal plants in the past are reviewed and documented in this  article. RESULTS: The multi-disciplinary, multicentric research initiatives of ICMR have  resulted in validation of traditional treatment Kshaarasootra (medicated  Ayurvedic thread) for anal fistula, Vijayasar (heart wood of Pterocarpus  marsupium Roxb.) for diabetes mellitus, encouraging micro- and macrofilaricidal  activity of Shakotak (stem bark of Streblus asper Lour.) in experimental studies  an iridoid glycosides fraction isolated from root/rhizomes of Picrorhiza kurroa  Royle ex Benth. (designated as Picroliv) for viral hepatitis. Other  developmental and compilation of research works on Indian medicinal plants have  resulted in publications of the thirteen volumes of quality standards,  comprising of 449 Indian medicinal plants; three volumes of 90 phytochemical  reference standards; fifteen volumes of review monographs on 4167 medicinal  plant species; and one publication each on perspectives of Indian medicinal  plants for management of liver disorders, lymphatic filariasis and diabetes  mellitus (details available at http://www.icmr.nic.in/mpsite). CONCLUSION: The ICMR efforts assume special significance in the light of  multifaceted use of medicinal plants, and the need of better drugs and remedies  for various diseases. Further, the indigenous system of medicine, and the plant  drugs, could promise to provide both concepts of therapy, as well as therapeutic  agents in the areas, where modern system of medicines has few answers.

380,"OBJECTIVE: Despite a growing body of literature on complementary and alternative  medicine, there is still limited information on the use of Ayurveda in the  United States. Because Ayurveda is one of the world's major traditional medical  systems, knowledge of its use is important. In particular, information on  utilization by Asian Indians living in the United States is needed due to  increased immigration from India and related regions. Recent reports of heavy  metal contamination of some imported Ayurveda products underscore this need. For  this reason, an exploratory survey was conducted. DESIGN: A semistructured 21-item questionnaire was administered using  face-to-face interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study comprised a convenience sample of 64 Asian  Indians living in Northern California. OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included sociodemographic variables,  questions on awareness, knowledge and use of Ayurvedic products or services, use  of other nutritional/herbal products, and reasons for use. RESULTS: In the sample, 95% of the participants were aware of Ayurveda, 78% had  knowledge of Ayurvedic products or treatments, and about 59% had used or were  currently using Ayurveda. Only 18% of those using Ayurveda had informed their  Western medical doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Given its common use in the United States by Asian Indians, its  cultural relevance, potential therapeutic value, and possible safety concerns,  physician and consumer education along with more empirical research is  warranted.",What should I know about the safety of using Ayurvedic products in the United States?,"I've heard a lot about Ayurveda recently.

381,"Non-allopathic Indian medicines, referred to elsewhere in the world as  complementary and alternative medicine have gathered increasing recognition in  recent years with regard to both treatment options and health hazards. Ayurveda,  Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems.  These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet,  herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as  non-drug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and  by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India,  particularly in rural India, where 70% of the population lives. The difference  between modern medicine and these systems stems from the fact that the knowledge  base of many of the above systems, unlike Western medicine, is based on years of  experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and has been handed down  generations both through word of mouth and treatises. The focus on  non-allopathic systems of medicine in India can be attributed to various causes  including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80% of the  country's population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing  worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific  research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. Elsewhere, the increasing use  of herbal products worldwide and the growth of the herbal product industry has  led to increasing concern regarding their safety. The challenges in these  non-allopathic systems relate to the patient, physician, regulatory authorities,  the abuse/misuse of these medicines, quality and purity issues. Safety  monitoring is mandated by a changing ecological environment, the use of  insecticides, new manufacturing techniques, an as yet unregulated pharmaceutical  industry, the availability of combinations of herbs over the counter and not  mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the need to look at the active  principles of these medicines as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The Indian  traditional medicine industry has come a long way from the times when it was  considered unnecessary to test these formulations prior to use, to the  introduction of Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for the industry.  However, we still have a long way to go. The conflict between the traditional  practitioners and the purists demanding evidence of safety and efficacy needs to  be addressed. There is an urgent need for the practitioners of the allopathic  and non-allopathic systems to work together to optimise the risk-benefit profile  of these medicines.",What precautions should I take when using non-allopathic Indian medicines for my health concerns?,I've been hearing a lot about these alternative medicines from India like Ayurveda.

382,"AIM: Attitudes and practice concerning complementary and alternative medicine  (CAM) are currently an area of considerable importance. However, little is known  about the overall importance of CAM in groups of health care professionals.  Therefore, the primary objective was to analyse the knowledge about and use of  CAM in an ethnically diverse student population at the London School of  Pharmacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to students (264 completed  questionnaires, response rate: 59.1%) and in-depth interviews were carried out  with a sample of seven students. RESULTS: Forty-three percent reported using at least one type of CAM during the  last 12 months. The types of CAM used that were most frequently mentioned  include aromatherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and medicinal  herbalism. TCM was reported by students of Chinese origin and by students from  other ethnic backgrounds. However, Ayurvedic (Indian) medicine and medicine from  Africa were only used in cultures from which the users originated. The study  shows that a large number of herbal medical products were commonly reported by  students of pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The knowledge about and use of CAM is widespread among this group of  future health care professionals and the students also expressed a strong  interest in the topic. In-depth studies on the knowledge and use of CAM among  other health care professionals and among ethnic minorities are urgently needed  and may help to better manage the treatment of minor disorders as well as  chronic diseases.",What types of complementary and alternative medicine are commonly used by pharmacy students?,Do you think it's worth exploring things like aromatherapy or Traditional Chinese Medicine to help with my stress?,I've been hearing a lot about these alternative medicines like aromatherapy and Chinese herbal remedies.

(Solanaceae), commonly  known as Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng, is used in Ayurveda (Indian system of  traditional medicine) for vitality, cardio-protection and treating other  ailments, such as neurological disorders, gout, and skin diseases. AIM OF THE REVIEW: We present a critical overview of the information on the  metabolomics of W. somnifera and highlight the significance of the technique for  use in quality control of medicinal products. We have also pointed out the use  of metabolomics to distinguish varieties and to identify best methods of  cultivation, collection, as well as extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relevant information on medicinal value, phytochemical  studies, metabolomics of W. somnifera, and their applications were collected  from a rigorous electronic search through scientific databases, including  Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Structures of selected  metabolites were from the PubChem. RESULTS: The pharmacological activities of W. somnifera were well documented.  Roots are the most important parts of the plant used in Ayurvedic preparations.  Stem and leaves also have a rich content of bioactive phytochemicals like  steroidal lactones, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. Metabolomic studies revealed  that metabolite profiles of W. somnifera depended on plant parts collected and  the developmental stage of the plant, besides the season of sample collection  and geographical location. The levels of withanolides were variable, depending  on the morpho/chemotypes within the species of W. somnifera. Although studies on  W. somnifera were initiated several years ago, the complexity of secondary  metabolites was not realized due to the lack of adequate and fool-proof  technology for phytochemical fingerprinting. Sophistications in chromatography  coupled to mass spectrometry facilitated the discovery of several new  metabolites. Mutually complementary techniques like LC-MS, GC-MS, HPTLC, and NMR  were employed to obtain a comprehensive metabolomic profile. Subsequent data  analyses and searches against spectral databases enabled the annotation of  signals and dereplication of metabolites in several numbers without isolating  them individually. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides a critical update of metabolomic data  and the diverse application of the technique. The identification of parameters  for standardization and quality control of herbal products is essential to  facilitate mandatory checks for the purity of formulation. Such studies would  enable us to identify the best geographical location of plants and the time of  collection. We recommend the use of metabolomic analysis of herbal products  based on W. somnifera for quality control as well as the discovery of novel  bioactive compounds.",What are the health benefits of Ashwagandha in Ayurvedic medicine?,I've heard about Ashwagandha being used in traditional medicine.

384,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the supportive evidence for the use of Ayurvedic medicine  in the management of existing and recurrent nephrolithiasis. METHOD: Nine Ayurvedic medicines commonly utilized in the management of  nephrolithiasis were identified by discussions with Ayurvedic practitioners in  India. Mechanistic and clinical studies evaluating the use of these agents were  identified using the Medline database and bibliographies suggested by Ayurvedic  practitioners. The articles were then critically reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: Four in vitro mechanistic studies, eight animal studies, and seven  human trials were identified. Phyllanthus niruri has undergone mechanistic in  vitro, animal, and clinical trials that support its impact on calcium oxalate  crystallization. Preliminary clinical trials have evaluated the role of Dolichos  biflorus and Orthosiphon grandiflorus in the prevention of urolithiasis and fish  stone as a method of stone expulsion, yet the treatment effect and mechanism of  action remains to be elucidated. CONCLUSION: Ayurvedic medicine holds promise as a complementary approach to the  management and prevention of nephrolithiasis. The best studied compound is P.  niruri. Further controlled randomized clinical trials are justified to support  or refute the potential benefits demonstrated in these initial studies.",Can Ayurvedic medicine help in the management and prevention of kidney stones?,"I get kidney stones a lot, is there anything natural like Ayurvedic medicine that could help prevent them?",Can Ayurvedic medicine help with my recurring kidney stones issue?
385,"Elemental composition of some Ayurvedic medicinal plants used for healing  urinary tract disorders has been studied by nondestructive neutron activation  analysis with a 252Cf source and atomic absorption spectroscopy. In total, 14  elements have been estimated in different plants; among these Cu, Cr, Co and Cd  are found to be present at the trace level; Mn, Pb, Zn, Ni, Na, Fe and Hg at  minor level and K, Ca and Cl at major level. The differences in the  concentration of the elements are attributed to soil composition and the climate  in which the plant grows. The importance of some elements in diseases related to  renal disorders is also briefly discussed.",What kind of elements are found in Ayurvedic medicinal plants used for urinary tract disorders?,I've heard that some plants can help with urinary tract issues.

386,"OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and  alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with essential hypertension. METHOD: 521 consecutive patients visiting the Hypertension Clinic at the  Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India,  over a 6-month period were interviewed. Information was gathered on the  patients' demographics, type(s) of CAM used, sequence of seeking CAM and  conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons for opting for CAM and  areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM.  Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: It was observed that 63.9% of patients overall used CAM. Ayurveda was  the most commonly used CAM (56.7%), followed by herbal medicines (14.4%). The  most commonly cited reason by patients for using CAM was fear of adverse drug  reactions of conventional medicines (59.0%). However, more than half of the  patients eventually became dissatisfied using CAM. Only 5.4% of CAM users had  informed their medical doctors about the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients receiving conventional  treatment for hypertension also use CAM therapies. A better understanding of the  pattern of CAM use amongst these patients will help dispel prevalent  misconceptions concerning CAM and, at the same time, assist conventional  practitioners to critically evaluate possible gaps or omissions in their own  prescribing habits.",What types of complementary and alternative medicine could be used for treating high blood pressure?,I have high blood pressure and I'm a bit scared of the side effects of my meds.

388,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common form of arthritis,  causing disability and impaired quality of life especially in the elderly. Sri  Lankan traditional medicine (STM) is widely used to treat OA, but no clinical  trial evaluated on STM regimens for KOA to discuss their safety and efficacy in  the treatment. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of  STM regimen for KOA in comparison to recommended conventional pain management  therapy over a period of 8 weeks on relieving the condition. STUDY DESIGN: This is a clinical trial following a protocol-driven open-labeled  randomized controlled study enrolling patients with KOA that will be conducted  as a single-center trial in the National Ayurveda Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka.  Rasnadvigunabhagasaya herbal decoction (RDBD) and an herbal pill Yoaraja Guggulu  were selected as the rescue medication for treating joint disorders. The two  Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs tab paracetamol and tab ibuprofen as the rescue  medication for their safety and efficacy. As test products for external  application, oil with an herbal fomentation-Kumburuetaperumkayam Pottani  (KAP)-and paste-Sandivadam Lepaya (SVL)-were selected. External applications  will be tested against the diclofenac sodium gel and hot water fomentation. KOA  patients will be allocated randomly into two arms, and the medications will be  given orally for 60 days and externally for 30 days. The primary endpoint is the  change in the score on the WOMAC after 08 weeks. WOMAC and KOOS will be recorded  and compared between the two arms prior to visiting 1, at the end of 15 days and  end of 30 days, and end of the 45 days and end of the second month and 3 months  of follow-up. KOOS and WOMAC subscales, a pain disability index, a visual analog  scale for pain and sleep quality, and a quality-of-life index are used as  secondary outcome measurements. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will be able to provide evidence-based  scientific data on Sri Lankan traditional medicine regimens in the management of  KOA. This trial is expected to develop capacity to scientifically evaluate  various STM that are claimed to have efficacy in treatment of various disease  conditions.

390,"An ancient system of natural medicine--Maharishi Ayur-Vedic--prescribes certain  herbal formulas to enhance cognitive functioning, prevent illness, and alleviate  the detrimental effects of the aging process. A double-blind study was conducted  to test the effect of an Ayurvedic herbal preparation, Maharishi Amrit Kalash  (MAK), on an age-related alertness task. Forty-eight men over 35 years of age  were randomly assigned to receive MAK tablets or a closely matched placebo twice  daily for six weeks. A visual discrimination task consisted of the  identification of the exact location of a stimulus ""v"" within an array of x  symbols in tachistoscopic presentations. The MAK group improved significantly  more in their performance of this task after three and six weeks of treatment  relative to the placebo group. Performance was highly correlated with age, and  because successful performance apparently requires an unrestricted flow of  homogeneous attention as well as focalized concentration, it is concluded that  MAK may enhance attentional capacity or alertness, and thus reverse some of the  detrimental cognitive effects of aging.",Can Ayurvedic herbal preparations help improve cognitive function and alertness in older adults?,I've been having trouble staying focused lately.

Their collective results suggest that heavy metals,  particularly lead, have been a regular constituent of traditional Indian  remedies. This has repeatedly caused serious harm to patients taking such  remedies. The incidence of heavy metal contamination is not known, but one study  shows that 64% of samples collected in India contained significant amounts of  lead (64% mercury, 41% arsenic and 9% cadmium).

393,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of morbidity and  mortality in both developing and developed countries. An underlying cause of IHD  involves retention and deposit of serum lipids in coronary arteries, decreasing  blood flow. Drugs (conventional and herbal) are used to lower levels of serum  cholesterol to help prevent IHD. The Ayurvedic medicine pharmacopoeia identified  herbs that might contribute to a decrease in cholesterol and therefore reduce  the risk of IHD. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted at 3 points: 2003, 2004, and 2007.  Databases searched included PubMed, the National Library of Medicine, the  National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Ovid, and EBSCO  Information Services, and other search strategies also were used. Each article  was assessed for quality by 3 people, and discrepancies were resolved by  arbitration using a fourth person, who also read and scored each article.  Additional assessments of safety using a scale and determination of reported  efficacy/effectiveness of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and  quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) were made. RESULTS: RCTs generally received high quality scores and improved by decade of  publication. More than 50% of garlic, more than 80% of guggul, and 100% of  Arjuna RCTs reported product effectiveness. Safety scores did not improve by  decade. The QEDs received medium and high quality scores, and 93% of them  reported effectiveness. The QEDs had a higher mean score for safety reporting  than the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies received high quality scores and noted safety  information and reported effectiveness or efficacy in a clear manner. This  finding was not consistent with other systematic reviews that have found the  highest reported efficacy/ effectiveness in studies of poorer quality. Ayurvedic  herbs reviewed here should be considered by physicians when trying to manage  hyperlipidemia in their patients.",What Ayurvedic herbs can help in managing high cholesterol levels?,I heard that high cholesterol can lead to heart disease.

396,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don is a well known  medicinal plant belonging to family Apocynaceae that have been traditionally  used as medicine since ancient times. C. roseus is a well-recognized herbal  medicine due to its anticancer bisindole alkaloids (vinblastine (111),  vincristine (112) and vindesine (121)). In the Ayurvedic system of medicine,  different parts of C. roseus are used in folklore herbal medicine for treatment  of many types of cancer, diabetes, stomach disorders, kidney, liver and  cardiovascular diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main idea behind this communication is to update  comprehensively and analyze critically the traditional applications,  phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and toxicity of various extracts and  isolated compounds from C. roseus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presented data covers scientific works on C. roseus  published across the world between 1967 and 2021 was searched from various  international publishing houses using search engines as well as several  traditional texts like Ayurveda and relevant books. Collected data from  different sources was comprehensively summarized/analyzed for ethnomedicinal  uses, phytochemistry, analytical chemistry, biological activities and toxicity  studies of C. roseus. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: C. roseus has a wide range of applications in the  traditional system of medicine especially in cancer and diabetes. During  phytochemical investigation, total of 344 compounds including monoterpene indole  alkaloids (MIAs) (110), bisindole alkaloids (35), flavonoids (34), phenolic  acids (9) and volatile constituents (156) have been reported in the various  extracts and fractions of different plant parts of C. roseus. The extracts and  isolated compounds of C. roseus have to exhibit many pharmacological activities  such as anticancer/cytotoxic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antioxidant,  larvicidal and pupicidal. The comparative toxicity of extracts and bioactive  compounds investigated in dose dependent manner. The investigation of toxicity  showed that the both extracts and isolated compounds are safe to a certain limit  beyond that they cause adverse effects. CONCLUSION: This review is a comprehensive, critically analyzed summarization of  sufficient baseline information of selected topics in one place undertaken till  date on C. roseus for future works and drug discovery. The phytochemical  investigation including biosynthetic pathways showed that the MIAs and bisindole  alkaloids are major and characteristic class of compounds in this plant. The  present data confirm that the extracts/fractions and their isolated alkaloids  especially vinblastine (111) and vincristine (112) have a potent  anticancer/cytotoxic and antidiabetic property and there is a need for further  study with particular attention to the mechanisms of anticancer activity.

397,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ayurvedic  treatment on deceleration of the disease progress of nondialysis patients with  stage IV or V chronic renal failure (CRF). Materials and Methods: A complex oral  and proctocolonic Ayurvedic multiherbal medication was administered daily for 1  month to inpatients. Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral  medication for additional 5 months. Four renal function tests (RFTs) were  evaluated at various time points (TPs): (1) 6 months before baseline (TP -6),  (2) at baseline (TP 0), and (3) after completion of 6 months of treatment (TP  +6). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse-Geisser  correction and Friedman's ANOVA by ranks were used to analyze the RFTs. For post  hoc tests, the Bonferroni correction was applied. Bias-corrected effect sizes  (Hedges) for the treatment were calculated. Results: Sixty-four nondialysis CRF  patients with laboratory investigations of the preceding 6 months were included;  12 patients discontinued the treatment. Fifty-two patients with stage IV or V at  baseline completed the study. Mean concentrations of estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and hemoglobin differed significantly  between TPs (eGFR: F = 15.3, p < 0.001; serum creatinine: F = 29.3, p < 0.001;  blood urea: F = 2.0, p = 0.159; hemoglobin: F = 53.9, p < 0.001). Pairwise  comparisons of the mean differences between TPs are significant for eGFR,  creatinine, and hemoglobin. For blood urea, a significant decrease was observed  for the treatment period [15.9(↓) mg/dL, standard error 4.0; n = 52], but a  nonsignificant increase was observed for the pretreatment period [16.2(↑) mg/dL,  standard error 9.8] due to insufficient data for TP -6 (n = 26). The effect  sizes for eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin were medium (0.45, 0.53,  0.44, and 0.30). Conclusions: After 6 months of treatment, statistically and  clinically significant improvements of eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and  hemoglobin and a significant shift to better CRF stages were observed. Several  cardinal symptoms were also significantly reduced.

398,"Despite decades of research on India's plural health care market, the practices  of many local health traditions outside the allopathic and codified traditions  are under-studied. Drawing on interview and observational data, this paper  explores the space in which indigenous traditional Khasi healers in Meghalaya  state, northeast India, practice. Khasi indigenous healers describe themselves  as doktor sla, plant doctors, to distinguish themselves from doktor kot, or book  doctors. This distinction operates as a rhetorical resource, utilised to carve a  distinct sphere of expertise in relation to the allopathic sector, and to mark  claims for the specifically local appropriateness of traditional practices  within a shifting market of state-sponsored provision. Khasi healers are a  heterogeneous group who treat a wide variety of conditions, including physical  ailments which have no obvious correlates in biomedical systems, and  musculoskeletal disorders, with which they have recognised expertise. In  addition to claiming these discrete strengths, healers also present themselves  as accommodating deficiencies in biomedicine, including inherent generic  weaknesses of allopathic care as well as specific local gaps in rural health  care provision. Thus, the expertise niches of traditional healers have evolved  through their interactions with, and the needs of, the community, but also  through managing a shifting boundary with biomedical practitioners, who are  explicitly sceptical of their efficacy, but tacitly accepting of the ways in  which they manage the gaps in biomedical provision. While codified  non-biomedical traditions in India have engaged in universalising  professionalising projects, in this setting at least, non-codified practitioners  have instead utilised discourses of localism.",What are some traditional healing practices used by Khasi healers in India?,"I've heard about these plant doctors in India, what kind of health issues do they treat?",What kind of natural treatments might a traditional Khasi healer suggest for my chronic back pain?

400,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and synthesize the evidence on the effect of Ayurvedic  therapies for diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Systematic review of trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a  system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic  treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles  in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching  journals in India were examined, yielding 54 articles reporting the results of  62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and  Eugenia jambolana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush-82 and  D-400 were most often studied. Thirty-five of the studies included came from the  Western literature, 27 from the Indian. Seven were randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) and 10 controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or natural experiments.  Twenty-two studies went on to further analysis based on a set of criteria. Of  these, 10 were RCTs, CCTs, or natural experiments, 12 were case series or cohort  studies. There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil,  fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 have a  glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study. Evidence of effectiveness of  several other herbs is less extensive (C tamala, E jambolana, and Momordica  charantia). CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in the available literature on Ayurvedic  treatment for diabetes. Most studies test herbal therapy. Heterogeneity exists  in the herbs and formulas tested (more than 44 different interventions  identified) and in the method of their preparation. Despite these limitations,  there are sufficient data for several herbs or herbal formulas to warrant  further studies.",What Ayurvedic herbs or treatments can help in managing diabetes?,"I've heard that some herbs can help with diabetes.

401,"INTRODUCTION: Lead poisoning is most commonly caused by occupational exposure.  It presents with a myriad of signs and symptoms ranging from mild anemia to  frank encephalopathy, depending on the blood lead levels as well as the duration  of exposure. Intake of herbal/Ayurvedic medicine may also lead to plumbism as  heavy metals are often incorporated in such medications with the belief that  such metals have medicinal properties. METHODS: We report a case of lead poisoning caused by Ayurvedic medication. The  patient presented with symptoms of intestinal obstruction to the surgical  casualty. RESULTS: The patient presented with symptoms that mimicked intestinal  obstruction. No specific etiology could be determined. Serum lead levels were  determined and diagnosis of lead poisoning ascertained. The lead content of the  medicine was analyzed and it contained 30% w/w lead. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning consequent to intake of  alternative medicine must be kept in mind when a patient presents with vague  complaints.",What are some symptoms of lead poisoning from Ayurvedic medications?,I've been taking some natural Ayurvedic medicine lately and feeling kinda weird.

403,"OBJECTIVES: The effect of tongue cleaning on digestive power is mentioned in  Ayurvedic information sources. However, no study has yet evaluated this. We  aimed to evaluate the effects of tongue cleaning on digestive power from  Ayurvedic viewpoint, and on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in  healthy adults. DESIGN: Randomized cross-over. INTERVENTIONS: We recruited healthy adults aged 20-60 years. After  randomization, the immediate intervention group started tongue cleaning with a  tongue scraper every morning for 4 weeks, and then waited for 4 weeks. The  delayed intervention group initially waited for 4 weeks, and then started tongue  cleaning in the same way. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the outcomes using the questionnaire on  digestive power from Ayurvedic viewpoint, and the General Oral Health Assessment  Index for OHRQoL. We estimated the effects of tongue cleaning using generalized  estimating equations (GEE). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, by  comparing the changes in outcomes during the first 4 weeks of both groups. RESULTS: Of 58 participants, 57 completed the study. In GEE analysis, tongue  cleaning showed improvement in some components of Ayurvedic digestive power  represented by fecal and body conditions. For example, the odds ratio for  improvement of constipation was 2.80 (95% CI: 1.04-7.58). The General Oral  Health Assessment Index score was significantly increased by 4.33 points (95%  CI: 2.18-6.48) after tongue cleaning.

404,"BACKGROUND: Millions worldwide use Ayurvedic (traditional Indian) medicines.  These medications are increasingly associated with lead poisoning, often  accompanied by anemia. We compared the relative hematopoietic toxicity of  Ayurvedic lead poisoning with a common form of occupational lead poisoning. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively studied 66 adult lead intoxications: 43  published Ayurvedic cases identified in published reports by searching MEDLINE  (1966 to November 2005); 4 Ayurvedic patients seen at a referral center; and 19  lead paint intoxications from the same center. We considered patients' age,  gender and blood lead at presentation, and then compared the groups with respect  to hematopoietic parameters. RESULTS: Ayurvedic lead poisoning was associated with higher blood lead  (p<0.001), more basophilic stippling (p<0.001), lower hemoglobin (p<0.001) and  higher protoporphyrin (p<0.001). Multiple regression adjusted for blood lead and  gender found Ayurvedic lead poisoning associated with a 36.2 g/L (95% CI -48.8,  -23.6 g/L) greater decrement in hemoglobin (p<0.001) as compared to  paint-removal poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic poisoning produces greater hematopoietic toxicity than  paint-removal poisoning. Ayurvedic ingestion should be considered in patients  with anemia. Ayurveda users should be screened for lead exposure and strongly  encouraged to discontinue metal-containing remedies.",Is it safe to use Ayurvedic medicines and what are the potential risks?,I've been taking some traditional Indian medicine lately and I've been feeling kinda off. Could it have anything to do with that?,I've been taking some Indian Ayurvedic medicines for my health. Should I be worried about lead poisoning and what are the signs I should look out for?
405,"Treatments offered at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway are based  on Maharishi Vedic Medicine (MVM). MVM is a consciousness-based revival by  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program  of the ancient Ayurvedic medicine tradition in India. To extend from 6 to 24  months, a pilot study of the effects of the treatment program at the Health  Centre on fibromyalgia. Retesting 2 years after a clinical trial. In this  intention to treat study, 31 women with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia received an  individually tailored program of (1) physiological purification therapy  (Maharishi Panchakarma) and (2) Ayurvedic recommendations regarding daily  routine and diet including a novel approach to food intolerance. Five subjects  chose to learn TM for stress reduction, pain management and personal  development. All were recommended Ayurvedic herbal products for follow-up  treatment. A modified Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) that included  seven dimensions. Scores at 24 months follow-up were compared with pre-treatment  scores. At 24-months follow-up, there were significant reductions (26% to 44%)  in six of the seven fibromyalgia dimensions: impairment of working ability,  pain, tiredness, morning tiredness, stiffness and anxiety. The 7th, depression,  decreased 32% (borderline significant). At 24 months, the four subjects who  continued practising TM, had almost no symptoms and significantly lower FIQ  change scores (-92% to 97%) than the non-meditators on all outcomes. This pilot  study suggests that the treatments and health promotion programs offered at the  Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway lead to long-term reductions in  symptoms of fibromyalgia, which is considered a treatment-resistant condition,  and further studies are warranted.",How can Maharishi Vedic Medicine help in managing fibromyalgia symptoms?,I've been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety lately.

406,"Cinnabar is an attractive mineral with many different uses. It is reported that  cinnabar is one of the traditional Chinese's medicines extensively use. The main  objective of this critical review is to identify the current overview, concept  and chemistry of cinnabar, which includes the process developments, challenges,  and diverse options for pharmacology research. It is used as a medicine through  probable toxicity, especially when taking overdoes. This review is the first to  describe the toxicological effects of cinnabar and its associated compounds.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) dependent metabolomics could be useful for  examination of the pharmaceutical consequence. The analysis indicated that the  accurate preparation methods, appropriate doses, disease status, ages with drug  combinations are significant factors for impacting the cinnabar toxicity.  Toxicologically, synthetic mercury sulfide or cinnabar should be notable for  mercuric chloride, mercury vapor and methyl mercury for future protection and  need several prominent advancements in cinnabar research.",What precautions should I take when using cinnabar in traditional Chinese medicine?,I've heard about cinnabar being used in traditional Chinese medicine. Is it safe to use or could it be toxic if I take too much?,Is cinnabar safe to use as a medicine and what should I be aware of before taking it?
407,"Despite the recent successes of targeted cancer immuno-therapies, drug  resistance and disease relapse remain a huge burden in cancer patient treatment.  This has fueled renewed interest in natural product discovery to identify new  pharmacophores for innovative cancer drug development. Reverse pharmacology  approaches of Withania somnifera leaves and roots (alternatively also called  Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng in traditional Ayurvedic and Unani folk medicine)  have identified Withaferin A (WA) as the most bioactive compound for treatment  of inflammatory ailments, supporting traditional use of their corresponding  extracts in indigenous medicine. In this review we summarize preclinical in vivo  evidence for therapeutic cancer applications of WA and provide a biochemical  framework of its polypharmaceutical effects against cancer hallmarks.",What is a natural product that could be used for cancer treatment?,"I've heard about this Ashwagandha stuff used in traditional medicine, could it potentially help in treating cancer or inflammation?",I've heard about Ashwagandha being used in traditional medicine.

408,"Terminalia chebula is a commonly advocated agent in Ayurveda for improving  gastrointestinal motility. Charles Foster rats (150-200 gms of either sex) were  divided into four groups as follows--Group 1 (n = 15) normal animals; Group II  (n = 6) rats administered metoclopramide (1.35 mg/kg); Group III (n = 8) rats  given atropine (0.45 mg/kg). These agents were injected intramuscularly, 30 mins  before the experiment. Rats from Group IV (n = 8) were administered Terminalia  chebula (100 mg/kg/day for 15 days orally). Metoclopramide and atropine have  established prokinetic and antikinetic activities respectively and are therefore  included for comparison. All rats were then given a test meal of methyl  cellulose (1.5%) mixed with phenol red (50 mg/100 ml) orally and gastric  emptying was measured 20 mins later. Gastric emptying of normal rats (Group I)  was found to be 51.6 +/- 7.79%. Metoclopramide significantly increased the  gastric emptying (76.33 +/- 12.37%; p < 0.01) and atropine inhibited the  motility (% gastric emptying being 7.26 +/- 19.76%; p < 0.01). Terminalia  chebula was found to increase the percent gastric emptying (86.57 +/- 6.65%; p <  0.01). Thus from this study it appears that Terminalia chebula can serve as an  useful alternative to prokinetic drugs available today.",Can the herb Terminalia chebula help improve my digestion?,I've been struggling with slow digestion. Could a natural remedy like Terminalia chebula help get things moving more quickly?,"Is there any natural remedy I could take to improve my digestion, similar to how Terminalia chebula seems to work?"
409,"The principal objective of this paper is to demonstrate the role of taste and  flavor in health from the ancient science of Ayurveda to modern medicine;  specifically their mechanisms and roles in space medicine and their clinical  relevance in modern heath care. It also describes the brief history of the use  of the monosodium glutamate or flavor enhancers (""Umami substance"") that improve  the quality of food intake by stimulating chemosensory perception. In addition,  the dietary nucleotides are known to be the components of ""Umami substance"" and  the benefit of their use has been proposed in various types of patients with  cancer, radiation therapy, organ transplantation, and for application in space  medicine.",What is the role of taste and flavor in maintaining good health according to Ayurveda and modern medicine?,"I've heard about this ""Umami substance"" thing, could that actually make my food taste better and be healthier for me?","Can you tell me about some natural foods or flavors that might improve my health and wellbeing, especially ones that might be beneficial for older folks like me?"
410,"In this study, the pharmacological and toxicological effects along with possible  side effects of the classical ayurvedic formulation ""Lauhasava"" (LSV), which is  used in anemia, were evaluated. During this study, various experiments on body  growth rate, organ-body weight ratio, tissue hydration indices and body fat  ratio were performed to evaluate its efficacy and toxicity. In the body weight  study, the LSV treated rats, irrespective of sexes, showed significantly lower  body weights than the control group rats. LSV treated mice of both sexes gained  less weight than their control counterparts. The study involving comparison of  the relative weights of the major organs of rats and mice revealed some  significant results. The percentage of lung to the body weight is significantly  increased in both sexes of rats. Liver weight in LSV treated rats of both sexes  were observed to be increased. The percentage of kidney weight was increased in  both sexes of rats, the result being significant in the case of female rats. The  thymus weight was found significantly decreased in both sexes of rats.  Significant increase in the weight of rats' ovaries was observed. In the tissue  hydration index experiment, only the increase in the female kidney was  significant. No significant result was found in the fat content of the whole  mice and eviscerated mice.","What are the potential side effects of the Ayurvedic formulation ""Lauhasava"" used for anemia treatment?","I've been hearing about this ""Lauhasava"" thing for anemia. Does it have any side effects I should know about?","I've been considering trying Lauhasava for my anemia, but I'm worried about side effects.
