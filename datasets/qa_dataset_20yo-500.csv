Can changing my lifestyle or diet with Ayurveda methods affect my genes and improve my overall health?,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive, natural health care system that originated in the  ancient Vedic times of India. Epigenetics refers to the external modification of  DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without  changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have  transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are  lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors.  Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti  (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and  indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus,  it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This  correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and  understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of  both sciences in the management of optimal health. In addition, research on  Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will further increase correlation  and understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda.","According to 'Ayurveda and Epigenetics', Ayurveda is an old-school health system from India that could actually help change how your genes work, without messing with their basic structure. This change, known as 'epigenetics', can be caused by how you live your life, what you eat, how stressed you are, and what's going on around you in your environment. Ayurveda can help manage these factors, which could indirectly affect your genes. This is an important area of Ayurveda that can help us understand and communicate better with modern medicine. Further research on how Ayurvedic practices affect gene activity could help bridge the gap between modern medicine and Ayurveda, leading to better health management."
"I've heard that diabetes is more than just having high blood sugar levels. Can something like Ayurveda, or holistic approaches in general, help manage it better?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with  complex multi-organ-multi-target crosstalk in the body. Currently, the  theoretical assumptions framing the diabetes management strategies are  reductionist and largely focus on reducing hyperglycemia through targeted  molecular drugs. While they effectively reduce hyperglycemia, they are  inadequate to address the multifactorial etiopathology, chronicity and systemic  complications of diabetes. Therefore, a holistic and systemic approach is  essential for its successful management. We hypothesize an integrative diabetes  management strategy, combining holistic principles of diabetes management with  its molecular understandings, would be more appropriate to fill this gap. The  holistic disease management principles of Ayurveda, the Indian system of  medicine, can play a pivotal role in this context. This narrative review  discusses the scope of a trans-disciplinary ' Ayurveda-Biology ' approach for  deepening the holistic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes as well  as designing novel integrative strategies for managing diabetes and restoring  whole body glucose homeostasis. METHODOLOGY: The article analyses the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management and  correlates it with the molecular understanding of its pathophysiology and  management. The sources of information used in this article include classical  texts of Ayurveda , medical books, published research articles and scientific  databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science-Direct, etc. RESULTS: While  Ayurveda and modern biomedicine uses different epistemology and ontology for  describing diabetes, both the systems recognize the central role of gut and gut  derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose  homeostasis. Essentially, the principles of both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine  overlap at a gut centred view of diabetes management; and Gastro-intestinal  mediated glucose disposal , a holistic concept of glucose metabolism, is  emerging as a converging node for designing innovative integrative diabetes  management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: An integrative disease management strategy, combining holistic and  reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively,  would be the prerogative for successful management of diabetes. Creating an '  Ayurveda-Biology' knowledge framework integrating the patient centred holistic  management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology  can give better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and  offer novel strategies for cost effective, holistic and multi-targeted  management of diabetes.","According to the research paper titled 'An 'Ayurveda-Biology' platform for integrative diabetes management', managing diabetes isn't just about lowering your blood sugar levels. It's a complex disease that affects different parts of your body. While modern medicine focuses on reducing high blood sugar, it might not fully address all the issues that diabetes can cause. Instead, combining the Western approach with principles from Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, could offer a more holistic way to handle the disease. This doesn't mean ditching your current treatment, but rather, integrating it with practices from Ayurveda. Both of these approaches understand the important role our gut plays in managing our blood sugar levels. So, a more inclusive treatment strategy could potentially"
I've heard that Ayurveda might help with managing epilepsy. Is there any truth to that?,"Epilepsy, a chronic non-communicable disease of the brain, is one of the most  common neurological diseases globally that affects people of all ages. The  existence of medical, neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive comorbidities has  always undermined the available advanced treatment strategies for epilepsy.  New-generation antiepileptic drugs being less successful in completely  controlling the seizures and observance of complex diseases, including  drug-resistant cases, have provided scope for integrating and incorporating the  therapeutic modalities of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian art of holistic medicine,  in the effective management of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara,  described in the classics of Ayurveda as the transient appearance of  unconsciousness with loathsome expression due to derangement of memory,  intelligence, and mind. The multifaceted therapeutic approach of Ayurveda, which  involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying  procedures, herbal and herbo-mineral formulations, disease, and host-specific  approaches, have enhanced the potential of not only relieving symptoms but also  modifying the pathophysiology of the disease. Newer paradigms of research in  Ayurveda, along with holistic and integrative approaches with contemporary  medicine, can not only benefit the existing healthcare system but also impact  future healthcare management in epileptology research. This cursory literature  review is an earnest attempt to identify, evaluate, and summarize various  studies and provide a comprehensive insight into the potential of Ayurveda in  understanding and treating epilepsy.","According to 'Ayurveda therapy in the management of epilepsy', epilepsy is a common brain disease that affects people of all ages and can be hard to treat due to its complex nature. Traditional medicines sometimes don't fully control the seizures. So, researchers are looking into Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, to help manage epilepsy. This approach not only uses different herbs and minerals but also includes lifestyle changes. This could not only help reduce symptoms but potentially change the disease itself. By combining Ayurveda with modern medicine, there's hope for better treatment for epilepsy in the future."
"So, can technology like computers and stuff be used to understand how traditional medicine like Ayurveda works better?","Coalescence of traditional medicine Ayurveda and in silico technology is a rigor  for supplementary development of future-ready effective traditional medicine.  Ayurveda is a popular traditional medicine in South Asia, emanating worldwide  for the treatment of metabolic disorders and chronic illness. Techniques of in  silico biology are not much explored for the investigation of a variety of  bioactive phytochemicals of Ayurvedic herbs. Drug repurposing, reverse  pharmacology, and polypharmacology in Ayurveda are areas in silico explorations  that are needed to understand the rich repertoire of herbs, minerals,  herbo-minerals, and assorted Ayurvedic formulations. This review emphasizes  exploring the concept of Ayurveda with in silico approaches and the need for  Ayurinformatics studies. It also provides an overview of in silico studies done  on phytoconstituents of some important Ayurvedic plants, the utility of in  silico studies in Ayurvedic phytoconstituents/formulations,  limitations/challenges, and prospects of in silico studies in Ayurveda. This  article discusses the convergence of in silico work, especially in the least  explored field of Ayurveda. The focused coalesce of these two domains could  present a predictive combinatorial platform to enhance translational research  magnitude. In nutshell, it could provide new insight into an Ayurvedic drug  discovery involving an in silico approach that could not only alleviate the  process of traditional medicine research but also enhance its effectiveness in  addressing health care.","According to 'Ayurveda and in silico Approach: A Challenging Proficient Confluence for Better Development of Effective Traditional Medicine Spotlighting Network Pharmacology', scientists are exploring how technology can be used to better understand and improve traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Ayurveda, an ancient health practice from South Asia, uses a variety of herbs and minerals for treating health issues. Now, researchers are using computer simulations to study these Ayurvedic ingredients and how they work. This could help us discover new medicines and make Ayurveda more effective. It's like using a video game simulation to understand how to win in real life!"
I get migraines a lot and normal treatments don't seem to work. Could something like Ayurvedic medicine help me out?,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is generally recognized as a complex condition, which is  often challenging to treat. Patients are often open to novel approaches to  understanding why this pain occurs and how to prevent future attacks. METHODS: Ayurvedic medicine, which is a 5000-year-old healing system, offers  additional understanding on this disease by categorizing patients into a unique  dosha (mind-body) type. Specific herbals, dietary modifications, and lifestyle  changes have been utilized for thousands of years to create balance in the  system to improve chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating migraine patients utilizing the Ayurvedic model allows  patients and practitioners a further layer of understanding and offers  additional treatment options for the patient.","According to 'Ayurveda--the science of healing', migraines can be tricky to understand and treat. But, Ayurveda, a 5000-year-old healing system, might offer some new insights. It suggests that everyone has a unique body and mind type, called a dosha. By figuring out your dosha type, you might be able to balance out your system with specific herbs, dietary changes, and lifestyle tweaks. This could give you some new options to help manage your migraines."
I'm thinking of having a baby soon. Can Ayurvedic practices help me have a healthier pregnancy and delivery?,"Ayurveda is a system of holistic medicine that integrates health with lifestyle  to restore balance and remove disease by resolving the imbalance that causes it.  Ayurvedic techniques that support digestion, immunity, vitality, and  rejuvenation can help assist women with a healthy conception, pregnancy,  delivery, and postpartum. Ayurvedic approaches can help common but bothersome  pregnancy symptoms as well as potentially prevent more serious pregnancy  complications. Specific techniques, including developing a daily routine and the  practice of pranayama to support vitality through breathing exercises are  described to help guide modern obstetrical practice.","According to 'Ayurveda for Modern Obstetrics', Ayurveda, which is a holistic approach to health, can really help women have a healthier pregnancy and lessen some of those annoying symptoms. It suggests things like having a daily routine, breathing exercises, and other techniques to boost your overall health. So, just like how working out or eating healthy can make you feel better, these Ayurvedic practices could potentially help with everything from conception to post-birth recovery."
"I've been feeling super stressed lately, especially with this whole pandemic thing. Could this be messing with my brain or body in some way?","In our increasingly stressed world, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic, the  activation of the threat network in everyday situations can adversely affect our  mental and physical health. Neurophysiological response to these  threats/challenges depends on the type of challenge and the individual's  neuroadaptability. Neuroadaptability is defined as the ability of the nervous  system to alter responsiveness over time to reoccurring stimuli.  Neuroadaptability differs from neuroplasticity, which is more inclusive and  refers to the ability of the nervous system to change and learn from any  experience. We examine neuroadaptability and how it affects health from the  perspective of modern medicine and Ayurveda.","According to 'Neuroadaptability and Habit: Modern Medicine and Ayurveda', the way your brain reacts to stressful situations can have a big impact on your health. This isn't just about big scary things, but even everyday stuff like dealing with COVID-19. The research talks about 'neuroadaptability', which is basically how your brain changes its response to things that keep happening. It's different from 'neuroplasticity', which is more about how your brain can learn and change from any experience. The paper looks at how this adaptability affects your health from the viewpoint of modern medicine and Ayurveda. So, it's important to manage your stress well to keep your brain and body healthy!"
I've heard a lot about Ayurvedic medicine lately. Can it really help with my health problems and how can I be sure it's safe and effective?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayurveda entails a scientific tradition of  harmonious living and its origin can be traced from ancient knowledge in Rigveda  and Atharvaveda. Ayurveda is a traditional healthcare system of Indian medicine  since ancient times. Several Ayurvedic medicines have been exploiting for  treatment and management of various diseases in human beings. The several drugs  have been developed and practiced from Ayurveda since ancient time to modern  practice as 'tradition to trend'. The potential of Ayurvedic medicine needs to  be explored further with modern scientific validation approaches for better  therapeutic leads. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to explore the various aspects of  Ayurveda and inspired drug discovery approaches for its promotion and  development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have reviewed all the literature related to the  history and application of Ayurvedic herbs. Various aspects for the quality  control, standardization, chemo-profiling, and metabolite fingerprinting for  quality evaluation of Ayurvedic drugs. The development of Ayurvedic drugs is  gaining momentum with the perspectives of safety, efficacy and quality for  promotion and management of human health. Scientific documentation, process  validation and several others significant parameters are key points, which can  ensure the quality, safety and effectiveness of Ayurvedic drugs. RESULTS: The present review highlights on the major goal of Ayurveda and their  significant role in healthcare system. Ayurveda deals with several classical  formulations including arka, asavas, aristas, churna, taila, vati, gutika,  bhasma etc. There are several lead molecules that have been developed from the  Ayurvedic herbs, which have various significant therapeutic activities.  Chemo-profiling of Ayurvedic drug is essential in order to assess the quality of  products. It deals with bioactive compound quantification, spurious and allied  drug determination, chromatographic fingerprinting, standardization, stability  and quality consistency of Ayurvedic products. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific validation and the documentation of Ayurvedic drugs are  very essential for its quality evaluation and global acceptance. Therapeutic  efficacy of Ayurvedic herbs may be enhanced with high quality, which can be  achieved by identity, purity, safety, drug content, physical and biological  properties. Ayurvedic medicines need be explored with the modern scientific  approaches for its validation. Therefore, an attempt has been made in the  present review to highlight the crucial aspects that need to be considered for  the promotion and development of Ayurvedic medicine.","According to 'Development of Ayurveda - Tradition to trend', Ayurveda, an ancient form of Indian medicine, has a lot of potential for treating different kinds of diseases. This paper suggests that for Ayurveda to be more accepted globally, it needs to be researched and understood using modern science. This means double-checking the quality and effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicines and ensuring they're safe. The study emphasizes that Ayurvedic medicine is becoming more popular because people are seeing how it can positively affect health. So, it's crucial to keep exploring and validating it with modern scientific methods."
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately. Can it teach me anything about digestion and metabolism?,"Ayurveda is a traditional system of healthcare that is native to India and has a  rich documented literature of its own. Most of the historians agree that the  documentation of core Ayurveda literature took place approximately in between  400 BCE and 200 CE, while acknowledging that the roots of its theoretical  framework can be traced back to a much earlier period. For multiple reasons many  significant contributions of Ayurveda literature to various streams of  biological and medical sciences have remained under-recognized while recounting  the historical milestones of development. This is true in the context of the  physiology of digestion and metabolism too. In this communication we try to  reconstruct a picture of the processes of digestion and metabolism as had been  understood by ancient Ayurveda scholars. Though this understanding was primitive  and insufficient in many ways, we argue that this deserves to be documented and  acknowledged. To help with grasping the importance of these contributions, we  juxtapose them with the corresponding insights pertaining to this subject  reported by prominent western scientists. The major contributions of Ayurveda  that have been recounted in this paper are those related to the description of  three distinct phases of digestion (Avasthapaka), multiple sets of  transformative entities acting at different levels of metabolism (Agni), and the  roles ascribed to various internal and external factors in executing these  physiological functions.","According to 'Overlooked contributions of Ayurveda literature to the history of physiology of digestion and metabolism', Ayurveda, an ancient health care system from India, had some pretty cool insights about how our bodies break down food and use it for energy, long before modern science. These old-school scholars talked about three different stages of digestion and a bunch of different factors that affect how our bodies process food, both inside us and from our environment. Even though their understanding wasn't perfect, it's still pretty impressive and deserves to be recognized."
I keep hearing about Ayurveda and its benefits. Are there any natural remedies or lifestyle changes it recommends that could help me stay healthy and possibly live longer?,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, included geriatrics as 1 of 8  medical divisions. Well-documented evidence exists for treating aging and  age-related disorders including dementia. Geriatrics was termed Rasayanatantra.  Cognitive function was well recognized and Sanskrit terms existed such as Buddhi  for intelligence and Cittanasa (Citta means mind, nasa means loss of) for  dementia. A normal human life span was considered to be 100 years. It could be  prolonged to 116-120 years through the use of preventive treatments, if they  were started during late youth or middle age. Treatments included herbal  preparations, diet, exercise, and attention to general mode of life and social  behavior. Several herbal formulations are described, including details of their  composition and preparation. The mode of action of antiaging drugs was believed  to occur at 3 levels. Detailed descriptions of the mode of action of several  herbs are provided, and recent research confirms some of this activity.","According to 'Dementia in Ayurveda', the ancient Indian health practice, Ayurveda, has long had methods for dealing with issues related to aging and memory loss, like dementia. It suggests that a person could potentially live up to 120 years if they start certain preventative treatments in their late youth or middle age. These treatments include things like certain diets, exercises, lifestyle changes, and even herbal medications. Modern research has even backed up some of these ancient practices. So, it might be worth looking into if you're interested in a holistic approach to staying healthy as you get older."
"So, I've heard that Ayurveda has some insights on aging and longevity. Could it also suggest ways to stay healthier and fresher for longer as I grow older?","OBJECTIVES: Various aspects of aging in Ayurveda literature has been explored  and correlated it with modern biological understanding. CONTENT: The concept of longevity is better understood upon the baseline  understanding of Aging ie. Jara. Manda Jara or Ajara is synonymous with  longevity. Vriddhavastha/Jirnavastha/Jara (old age) is the period after 60 or 70  years of age. This stage of life becomes very crucial as degenerative changes  occur in the body. Deterioration occurs to Dhatus, Indriya (perception power),  Bala (strength), Virya (potency), Utsaha (enthusiasm), Paurusha (masculinity),  Parakrama (valour), Grahana (reception), Dharana (retention), Smarana (memory),  Vachana (speech). Brihatrayis and Laghutrayis were reviewed to analyze the  various aspects of Ayu and Jara and correlated with research papers establishing  the concept of aging in terms of evidence-based technological advancements.  Databases like PubMed, Scopus were searched using keywords like Jara, Ayu  Lakshana, Aging, Old age, Senescence, biomarkers, DNA, blood biochemistry,  proteomics, genomics, microbiota, microbiome, androgen, estrogen, lipolysis,  peripheral blood monocytes, collagen, cognitive function; with the help of  Boolean operators. SUMMARY: Various aspects of Jara in Ayurveda have been analyzed by taking ample  references from evidence-based technological advancements related to the  physiology of aging. The indicators of biological aging based on recent  researches like genomic irregularities, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular  senescence, altered protein expression, immunological markers, oxidative stress,  pathological microbiota profile, telomere shortening in peripheral blood  monocytes, lipolysis, and many other factors have been put forward for basic  evidence in relation with Jara Lakshana. OUTLOOK: Understanding the physiology of aging will give the insight to manage  the elderly. So, the need of the hour is to develop strategies or to conduct  more researches which prevent senile disorders and thus increase the health span  for the future generation.","According to 'A review on the concept of aging in Ayurveda literature', the study talks about how getting older affects different parts of our bodies and minds. For example, as we age, we might notice changes in our strength, memory, and even our enthusiasm. The research looked at various scientific studies and found evidence that things like DNA changes, stress, and our gut health can all play a part in how we age. The paper suggests that understanding these changes can help us take care of older people better and maybe even find ways to stay healthier as we age ourselves."
"I've heard Ayurveda is more than just healthcare in Sri Lanka, and it's a way of life. Can it help me deal better with my stress and improve my overall well-being?","Ayurveda, in practice, comprises far more than a medical tradition in Sri Lanka.  It provides, in addition to a manuscript for health care, a popular knowledge  paradigm by which the population addresses social, epistemological and  ontological issues in their lives. The concept of health expands to include the  many existential levels that are basic to a definition of the self and the many  arenas of life in which it is made evident. The concept of 'multilectic' process  is introduced in this paper to explain this dynamic that characterizes popular  Ayurveda, a dynamic that Sri Lankans specify as consisting of a fundamental  complex interplay of mutually interrelated factors that are capable of  referencing multiple meanings and life contingencies neither contradictory,  dichotomous, nor unidirectional in nature. Because of the extent to which  Ayurveda is embedded in the everyday lives and fundamental conceptual frameworks  of the Sri Lankans, it is likely to remain an integrating knowledge system and a  powerful explanatory paradigm in their general lives as well as for their health  care dilemmas.","According to 'Ayurveda: a multilectic interpretation', Ayurveda is way more than just a health system in Sri Lanka. It's a way of understanding and navigating life, social issues, and even what it means to be you. It doesn't just focus on one issue or factor, but looks at how everything is interconnected in your life. So, it's not just about taking some herbs to feel better physically, but also about understanding yourself and your life better. And because it's so ingrained in daily life and thinking in Sri Lanka, it's not going anywhere anytime soon."
I've been getting pink eye a lot lately. Are there any natural or Ayurvedic treatments that could help?,"BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva. Although data  on clinical efficacy and safety of various ayurvedic treatments in  conjunctivitis is published, systematic review is not done. This systematic  review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ayurvedic  treatments in conjunctivitis. METHODS: A literature search of the Cochrane Library (Cochrane central register  of controlled trials: issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Pub Med, AYUSH research portal  (Govt. of India), DHARA portal, Google scholar and online clinical trials  registers was done. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized  controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and multiple arms  clinical trials were identified in which Ayurveda treatments with any dose,  type, schedule, drug, dosage form, and advised Pathayapathya (lifestyle changes)  were selected. RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, five CCTs and two multiple arms  clinical trials which includes a total of 816 participants. Meta analysis of  data from five trials showed that ayurvedic treatments benefitted more compared  with non-ayurveda interventions in symptoms like itching (SMD = -0.98, 95% CI  (-1.30,-0.65) p < 0.00001, I2 = 38%), pain (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI (-0.87, -0.29,  P = 0.0001, I2 = 0%), ropy discharge (SMD = -1.02, 95% CI(-1.45, -0.59),  P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), conjunctival congestion (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-0.91,  -0.43), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), foreign body sensation (SMD = -0.68, 95%  CI(-1.06, -0.29), p = 0.0006, I2 = 46%, Fig. 8) and lid heaviness (SMD = -0.66,  95% CI(- 0.98, -0.33), p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Although some findings confirm the benefit of ayurveda as opposed  to non ayurveda for the treatment of conjunctivitis, since the studies have high  risk of bias and are of lower quality, the findings could not be generalized.  There is a need for high quality studies in ayurveda in this regard. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42019129436.","According to 'Efficacy and Safety of Ayurveda interventions in the management of conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis', Ayurvedic treatments - a traditional Indian approach to medicine - could help with pink eye, or conjunctivitis. People who tried Ayurvedic treatments experienced less itching, pain, and other uncomfortable symptoms. However, it's worth noting that the research isn't rock solid, and we need more high-quality studies to confirm these findings. So, if you're thinking about trying Ayurveda for pink eye, it might be beneficial but don't forget to consult with a healthcare professional first."
"So, what I eat affects these tiny organisms living inside me and that influences my health? That's wild! Can you tell me more about how my diet can change my gut health?","The role of the microbiome in health and disease helps to provide a scientific  understanding of key concepts in Ayurveda. We now recognize that virtually every  aspect of our physiology and health is influenced by the collection of  microorganisms that live in various parts of our body, especially the gut  microbiome. There are many external factors which influence the composition of  the gut microbiome but one of the most important is diet and digestion. Ayurveda  and other systems of traditional health have for thousands of years focused on  diet and digestion. Recent research has helped us understand the connection  between the microbiome and the many different prevention and therapeutic  treatment approaches of Ayurveda.","According to 'The Microbiome in Health and Disease from the Perspective of Modern Medicine and Ayurveda', the tiny organisms living in our bodies, particularly in our guts, greatly influence our health. The things we eat and how we digest them play a major role in the types of these tiny organisms. This is something Ayurveda, an ancient health system, has focused on for thousands of years. So, what we're learning now is actually backing up these old methods of eating and digestion for better health."
I've been hearing a lot about traditional medicines from India and China. Are there any common remedies they both use that might help with digestive issues?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayurveda is the main traditional healthcare  system in Indian medicine. Tibetan medicine (TM), Mongolian medicine (MM),  Buddhist medicine (BM), Dai medicine (DM), and Uyghur medicine (UM) are main  traditional medicines practiced in China. These are existing traditional medical  systems that still play a role in disease prevention and treatment. AIM OF THE STUDY: To reveal the similarities and differences of traditional  medicinal preparations between Ayurveda in India and five traditional medicines  in China to deepen medical exchanges and cooperation between the two countries  and beyond. METHODS: All preparations were extracted from statutory pharmacopoeias, ministry  standards, and prescription textbooks from China and India. The information of  each preparation, such as therapeutic uses, medicinal materials, and preparation  forms, was recorded in Excel for statistical analysis and visual comparison. RESULTS: A total of 645 Ayurvedic preparations, 458 TM preparations, 164 MM  preparations, 616 BM preparations, 227 DM preparations, and 94 UM preparations  were identified. Preparations of the six traditional medicines were mostly used  for treating digestive, respiratory, and urogenital system diseases. The  preparation forms of these six traditional medicines are mainly pills and  powders. There are 38 shared-use medicinal materials in Ayurveda and TM  preparations, 25 in Ayurveda and MM preparations, 30 in Ayurveda and BM  preparations, 39 in Ayurveda and DM preparations, and 31 in Ayurveda and UM  preparations. Finally, we selected one important shared-use preparation  (Triphala) and 51 medicinal materials to research traditional use and modern  pharmacology. CONCLUSIONS: These preparations are used by different prescribers and users of  medicinal materials in different medical systems with the similarities and  differences. The similarities may reflect the historical exchanges of  traditional medicines between the two countries. The differences showed that  traditional medicines in China have absorbed some theories, diagnoses, and  treatments from Ayurveda but also retained their own ethnic and regional  characteristics.","According to 'Comparison of medicinal preparations of Ayurveda in India and five traditional medicines in China', traditional Indian and Chinese medicines have a lot in common, but they also have some unique features. The study looked at hundreds of treatments from each tradition and found that they're mostly used for problems with digestion, breathing, and the urinary system. These treatments are often in the form of pills or powders. The researchers found that there are many ingredients that are used in both Indian and Chinese medicine. This might be because of historical exchanges between the two countries. However, each tradition also has its own special methods and theories, showing that they've taken on characteristics of their own ethnic and regional cultures."
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda recently. Can you tell me what the Indian government is doing to develop and promote it?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayurveda (Sanskrit: Ayus - life +Veda -  knowledge) means the ""True knowledge of life"". Ayurveda deals with a complete  self-sustainable system of medicine. The Government of India through its  Ministry of AYUSH is responsible for policy formulation, development and  implementation of programs for the growth, development and propagation of  Ayurveda. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review aimed to highlight the various aspects of  government policies and initiatives for development of Ayurveda. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We critically reviewed various books, annual reports,  policy documents and various ancient Ayurvedic literatures. Besides the websites  of Ministry of AYUSH, National Medicinal Plant Board, Central Council for  Research on Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and AYUSH research portal have been  searched and data was recorded. RESULTS: The vision of the ministry is to position AYUSH systems as the  preferred systems of living and practice for attaining healthy nation. The  ministry has identified its mission in terms of seven broad thematic functional  areas of AYUSH activities. These are information, education and communication;  drug administration, human resource development, medicinal plants, research and  development, international collaborations, AYUSH services. Different programs  have been taken up towards increasing visibility, acceptability and usage of  Ayurveda vis-a vis its integration in the health system. Strategies to globalize  and promote Ayurveda are being taken up through AYUSH clusters focusing its  safety-efficacy-quality aspects and rational use of Ayurveda CONCLUSION: The  government policies are taking firm steps towards promotion and development of  Ayurveda. Research and development towards validation of Ayurveda is being  projected as the thrust area.","According to 'Government policies and initiatives for development of Ayurveda', the Indian government is really backing Ayurveda as an effective system of medicine. They're working on promoting it more, educating people about it, and doing lots of research to prove how well it works. They're even trying to spread the word about Ayurveda internationally. The main goal is to show that Ayurveda can be a safe and effective part of healthcare."

I've heard that traditional medicines from China and India use a lot of herbs. What are some common plants they use and what health benefits might they have?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: China and India have a long history in the  therapeutic application of botanical drugs in traditional medicine. Traditional  Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda are considered as two of the most ancient  systems of medicine, with history of more than two millennia. Medicinal plants  are the principal medicinal materials used in both these systems. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review discusses about the histories of Ayurveda and  TCM, the common medicinal plants species, the drug processing strategies used,  and the current statuses of these traditional systems of medicine (TSM). Through  the views presented in this article, we aim to provide a new perspective to  herbal drug researchers for expanding and improving the utilization of botanical  drugs and their therapeutic applications. METHODS: A bibliographic investigation of Chinese and Indian pharmacopoeias,  monographs and official websites was performed. Furthermore, information was  obtained from scientific databases on ethnobotany and ethno medicines. RESULTS: The review of Ayurveda and TCM ethno medicine indicates that both these  systems have many medicinal materials in common. The studies carried out by the  authors for comparison of plants from same genus from both these TSM's have been  discussed to further bring focus to the utilization of ""qualitatively"" similar  species which can be utilized and substituted for endangered or economically  valued species. The overview of ancient literature and scientific findings for  drugs in both these systems suggests that, the botanical drugs used in common  and their processing methods can be explored further for extensive utilization  in traditional medicine. CONCLUSION: This review describes the histories, common medicinal plant species,  their processing methods and therapeutic applications in Ayurveda and TCM. The  insights provided through this article may be used by herbal drug researchers  and pharmacologists for further exploration of botanical drugs from these two  traditional systems of medicine.","According to 'Botanical Drugs in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine', both Chinese and Indian traditional medicine use a lot of the same plants for their treatments. These ancient systems have been around for over 2000 years and are still used today. The researchers looked at old books and scientific databases to learn more about how these plants are used in both systems. They found that some plants can be swapped out for others when they're hard to find or too expensive. The hope is that more research will be done to expand the use of these plant-based treatments."
I heard about this plant called Ashwagandha that's supposed to help with sleep and overall health. What's the deal with that? Is it legit?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (Physalis  somnifera L.) is a fairly known perennial shrub of Solanaceae family, and is  used in Ayurveda- Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM), since ancient times. It is  well known as Ashwagandha in Sanskrit language in Ayurvedic classics. Its Mula  (root) is recommended for health and healing, and the number of single and  compound formulation is prescribed rationally. It is believed that the species  name-somnifera is coined based on popular use to ""induce sleep"" in Ayurveda. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to bring out the experience-based  traditional uses of Ashwagandha for health and healing with an emphasis on the  pharmacological and biochemical scientific evidences to corroborate them. The  scientific evidences have been explored from the national and international  publications. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A comprehensive literary search of Ayurvedic classics was  carried out systematically regarding Ashwagandha for its rationality behind the  traditional uses. To excavate the subject matter, the original Ayurvedic  scriptures and several standard Ayurvedic texts of different period was studied  insightfully for meaningful contribution. It is to be noted that the primary  source of knowledge was considered in writing this manuscript without any biased  attitude. The available literature on Ashwagandha was also searched to ascertain  the basis of scientific Latin name and correct identity. The Ayurvedic  Pharmacopoeia and other relevant scientific works were also taken into  consideration to make the subject matter more clearly to the scientific world.  For the scientific evidence of the uses, the international and national Journals  and other published material were also searched to make it inquisitiveness to  the scholars interested in Ayurvedic medicinal plants. RESULTS: The present paper throws ancient luminosity behind the therapeutic uses  of one of the promising plant drug i.e., Ashwagandha of ancient India even to  the present time. The scientific evidences corroborate the rationality ascribed  in available Ayurvedic classics of various period of India has been gained. CONCLUSION: The study explores that the first reference of Ashwagandha with its  significant nomenclature, useful part, properties, action, and eloquent uses has  its footprint in the original texts of Ayurveda. In later works enhanced  knowledge with traditional uses continued even today. Several single and  compound formulations have been found to maintain the health and to alleviate  the disorders rationally. It is worthy to note here that the scientific  evidences corroborate the uses practiced in Ayurveda.","According to ""Rational use of Ashwagandha in Ayurveda (Traditional Indian Medicine) for health and healing"", Ashwagandha, a shrub commonly used in traditional Indian medicine, has a lot of health benefits. The roots of the plant have been used for centuries to help with healing and overall well-being. Interestingly, the name 'Ashwagandha' is thought to come from its use in helping people to sleep better. The study looked into the historical use of Ashwagandha and found scientific evidence to support many of its traditional uses. So, whether it's to help you sleep, or just improve your overall health, Ashwagandha might be worth a shot!"
"I've heard about this Ayurveda stuff, but my doctor never mentioned it. Why don't healthcare professionals talk about alternative medicine like Ayurveda more often?","The editorial highlights the fact that there is limited communication between  healthcare providers and patients about complementary and integrative medicine  (TCI) like Ayurveda. To address this, healthcare professionals need better  education on Ayurveda. Additionally, international collaborations can enhance  research and credible information, ensuring safe and effective patient care.","According to 'Can Ayurveda medicine supplement modern medical treatments in chronic disease management?', there's not enough chat happening between doctors and patients about alternative treatments like Ayurveda. The paper suggests that doctors need to learn more about it and more international research needs to be done. This could help make sure patients are getting the safest and most effective care."
"So, Ayurveda seems to be about balancing faith and reason in medicine. Are there any simple practices from this that could help me manage stress?","Ayurveda is based largely upon two classics - Charaka-Samhita, representing the  school of medicine, and Sushruta-Samhita representing that of surgery. These two  texts mark the historic switch in the Indian medical tradition, from faith-based  therapeutics to its reason-based variant [1]. The Charaka-Samhita, which  acquired its present form in circa 1st century CE, uses two remarkable terms to  designate the distinctness of these approaches: daiva-vyapashraya (literally,  dependence on the unobservable) and yukti-vyapashraya (dependence on reason)  [2].","According to 'Do Ayurveda students need a course in Medical Astrology?', Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medical system, has two main texts. One focuses on medicine and the other on surgery. The cool thing is, these texts show how Indian medicine evolved from being faith-based, kind of like trusting in things we can't see, to being reason-based, like relying on logic and evidence. So, it's like going from believing in good luck charms to trusting in the effectiveness of a tested medicine."
I've been having some tummy troubles lately. Is there any natural remedy like Triphala that could help sort it out?,"AIM: The aim of this article is to review the current literature on the  therapeutic uses and efficacy of Triphala. Herbal remedies are among the most  ancient medicines used in traditional systems of healthcare such as Ayurveda.  Triphala, a well-recognized and highly efficacious polyherbal Ayurvedic medicine  consisting of fruits of the plant species Emblica officinalis (Amalaki),  Terminalia bellerica (Bibhitaki), and Terminalia chebula (Haritaki), is a  cornerstone of gastrointestinal and rejuvenative treatment. METHODS: A search of the PubMed database was conducted. RESULTS: In addition, numerous additional therapeutic uses described both in the  Ayurvedic medical literature and anecdotally are being validated scientifically.  In addition to laxative action, Triphala research has found the formula to be  potentially effective for several clinical uses such as appetite stimulation,  reduction of hyperacidity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating,  antibacterial, antimutagenic, adaptogenic, hypoglycemic, antineoplastic,  chemoprotective, and radioprotective effects, and prevention of dental caries.  Polyphenols in Triphala modulate the human gut microbiome and thereby promote  the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus while inhibiting the  growth of undesirable gut microbes. The bioactivity of Triphala is elicited by  gut microbiota to generate a variety of anti-inflammatory compounds. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes recent data on pharmacological properties  and clinical effects of Triphala while highlighting areas in need of additional  investigation and clinical development.","According to 'Therapeutic Uses of Triphala in Ayurvedic Medicine', Triphala is a natural remedy that's been used for ages in Ayurveda, which is a traditional form of Indian medicine. Triphala is made from the fruits of three different plants and is often used for stomach issues and overall body rejuvenation. The cool thing is that modern science is starting to back up some of these traditional uses. Not only can it help with digestion issues, but it might also stimulate appetite, reduce acidity in the stomach, and act as an antioxidant. It even has the potential to fight bacteria and protect against certain diseases. Plus, it can help balance the bacteria in your gut, promoting the good ones and fighting off the bad"
"Is it better for me to switch to natural oral care products like herbal toothpaste, considering all the chemicals in regular toothpaste?","Ayurveda recommends sound and healthy life. It basically focuses on prevention  rather than treatment. It includes a systematic lifestyle pattern which is  composed of several principles and activities. Dinacharya (Daily routine) is one  of the important principles. It includes various activities started from just  before sunrise. All these activities are necessary for the maintenance of  homeostasis of the body. Tooth brushing is one of the essential routines of  Ayurveda daily practices. Traditionally it has been advocated with a soft twig  of medicinal plants with or without herbal tooth powder. There are so many  medicinal plants have been described in this context. Contradictory plants have  also been described. Oral hygiene products are so much advanced and globalized  nowadays. There are so many types of toothbrushes; dentifrices, dental floss,  tongue scrapers, mouthwashes, oral irrigators, etc. are available along with  specifications. Contemporary oral hygiene products esp. dentifrices are  chemically rich and have their own side effects. No doubt these products have  their own advantages like easy availability and adjustability according to  current lifestyle. But their safety is questionable on long-term use. Herbal  products have additional benefits over it that those are natural and easily  adjustable and acceptable with body physiology.","According to 'A review on traditional practice of tooth brushing in Ayurveda and its relevance in current era', Ayurveda, an ancient health practice, stresses the importance of living a balanced life and focuses on preventing health issues. One of the key routines it suggests is tooth brushing, traditionally done with a soft twig from a medicinal plant. Modern oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash might be convenient and widely available, but they're often full of chemicals and might not be the best for long-term use. On the other hand, natural herbal products can be a good alternative as they're more in tune with our body's natural balance."
I've been hearing about this Ayurvedic fumigation therapy. Can it really help with things like stress and infections?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayurveda has its unique perceptions and  resultant methodologies for defining and treating human diseases. Fumigation  therapy is one of the several treatment methods described in Ayurveda whereby  fumes produced from defined drug formulations are inhaled by patients. This  therapeutic procedure offers promising research opportunities from phytochemical  and ethnopharmacological viewpoints, however, it remains under-noticed.  Considering these facts, this review is primarily aimed at introducing said  Ayurvedic fumigation therapy and discussing its scientific gaps and future  challenges. METHODOLOGY: A search of multiple bibliographical databases and traditional  Ayurvedic text books was conducted and the articles analyzed under various key  themes, e.g., Ayurvedic fumigation, fumigation therapy, medicinal fumigation,  inhalation of drugs and aerosol therapy. RESULT: Ayurveda recommends fumigation as a method of sterilization and  therapeutic procedure for various human diseases including microbial infections  and psychological disorders. However, it has not gained much attention as a  prospective field with multiple research opportunities. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to have a more detailed and systematic investigation  of the phytochemical and pharmacodynamic properties of Ayurvedic fumigation  therapy in order to facilitate the identification of novel bioactive compounds  and more effective drug administration methods.","According to 'Fumigation in Ayurveda: potential strategy for drug discovery and drug delivery', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, uses a treatment method where patients inhale fumes from special herbal mixtures. It's like lighting a scented candle, but these fumes can potentially help with various health issues, including infections and even psychological disorders. However, it's a bit under-the-radar and could use more research to fully understand how it works and how to make it more effective. So, it's kind of an old-school method with a lot of untapped potential."
I've been having some tummy troubles lately. Could this Triphala Rasayana stuff I've heard about help out with that?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayurveda remains the classical and comprehensive  part of the ancient Indian medicine system for well-being promotive, disease  preventive, and revival approach for the human body. Triphala Rasayana is  mentioned in Ayurveda, comprising fruits of three plant species viz. Phyllanthus  emblica L. (P. emblica), Terminalia chebula Retz (T. chebula), and Terminalia  bellirica Roxb (T.bellirica). Triphala Rasayana has been utilized in various  traditional medicine systems, viz., Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. Traditionally  Rasayana based drugs are utilized in different kinds of diseases without  pathophysiological associations as indicated by current medication. Various  medicinal attributes of Triphala Rasayana include antioxidant, anticancer,  antidiabetic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anticataract and is also  considered as a pillar for gastrointestinal treatment, specifically in  functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Due to Rasayana's accessible mode  of administration, availability, and affordability, there is an increase in its  global acceptance. AIM OF REVIEW: This review article summarizes the scientific validation,  traditional uses, bioactive compounds, and ethnopharmacological properties of  Triphala Rasayana. It also documents recent data on in vivo and in vitro  pharmacological studies and clinical effects of Triphala Rasayana. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A literature review is carried out using PubMed,  ScienceDirect, Scopus, web of science, Ayush Research Portal, and Clinical  Trials Registry-India. In addition to an electronic search, traditional  ayurvedic texts and books were used as sources of information. RESULTS: Traditionally, ""Triphala Rasayana"" is classified as a tridoshic  rasayana and one of the most well-studied ayurvedic Rasayana. It showed various  pharmacological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial,  immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, and antidiabetic. Besides this, Rasayana has  reported ethnopharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, anticataract,  wound healing, and radioprotection. It has shown a good impact on the  gastrointestinal tract (GIT) system with the reported pharmacological activities  in gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation, gastric ulcer, and  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Phytochemical studies of Triphala Rasayana  revealed chemical constituents like gallic acid, ellagic acid, chebulic acid,  chebulinic acid, methyl gallate, emblicanin A, and emblicanin B. Additionally,  clinical studies found Triphala Rasayana to be effective against diabetes,  constipation, and obesity. CONCLUSION: The present review revealed that Triphala Rasayana may treat a  diverse range of diseases, especially GIT disorders. Considering the beneficial  properties of Triphala Rasayana and it's proven non-toxic nature could be a  source of rejuvenation in contemporary healthcare. Nevertheless, its clinical  data effectively provided precious signals to correlate ayurvedic biology and  modern medicine.","According to 'Exploring scientific validation of Triphala Rasayana in ayurveda as a source of rejuvenation for contemporary healthcare: An update', Triphala Rasayana, a mixture of three types of fruits used in Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medicine system, has a lot of health benefits. It's kind of like a superfood, offering everything from cancer-fighting properties to helping with stomach issues like constipation and ulcers. It's also been found to be an antioxidant and has been used in treating diabetes and obesity. Plus, it's generally considered safe and non-toxic. So, if you're looking for a natural way to boost your health, you might want to give Triphala Rasayana a"
"So, Ayurveda is like an ancient health care system, right? I'm curious, are there any natural remedies or lifestyle changes it recommends for dealing with stress or anxiety?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayurveda, derives from the Sanskrit words Ayus  (life) and Veda (knowledge) is the most ancient system of traditional medicine  of the world. It has been practiced in Indian peninsula since 5000 BC to offer  natural ways to treat diseases and to promote healthcare. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the literature on the history, principles and current  status of Ayurveda. The data have been presented systematically including the  initiatives from Government of India. Several aspects of administrative  management, education, teaching and related aspects for promotion and  development of Ayurveda and other Indian systems of traditional medicine have  been discussed. RESULTS: This paper reviews on different aspects of development of Ayurveda.  Presently, there are 2420 hospitals with about 42271 beds, 15017 dispensaries,  429246 registered practitioners, more than 320 educational institutions, 7699  drug-manufacturing units to promote Ayurveda into the health care delivery  system in the country. Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India is the official document  for single Ayurvedic drugs (540 monographs) and different formulations (152  monographs). Several aspects in this regard for development of Ayurveda have  been discussed. CONCLUSION: Considering the widespread use and popularity of Ayurveda worldwide,  administrative management and infrastructure facilities, indigenous practices  and standards for quality control and it's evaluation have been highlighted. In  India, all such efforts for integration of Ayurveda provide potential role in  the health care benefits.","According to 'Changing scenario for promotion and development of Ayurveda--way forward', Ayurveda, an ancient traditional medicine system from India, is seeing a lot of development and growth. This is seen in the increase in hospitals, dispensaries, and educational institutions dedicated to Ayurveda, as well as the number of registered practitioners. The government in India has also been supporting this growth. They've even got an official document listing out all the medicines used in Ayurveda. Given its popularity, there's been a big focus on making sure everything is up to standard and works well. So, in India, Ayurveda seems to be playing a key role in healthcare."
I've been feeling really anxious and down lately. Are there any natural remedies or herbal treatments that might help me feel better?,"Neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease,  Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, depression and anxiety pose a  sizable global health problem, accompanying substantial burden of disorders,  suicides, physical comorbidities, high fiscal expenses, and poor quality of  life. There is a recent upsurge in global interest toward the area of  traditional therapies and phytomedicines are widely admired by researchers owing  to their natural source and fewer side effects. On the contrary, conventional  synthetic drugs have been reported with undesirable but inevitable ill effects  having poor patient compliance. Thus, herbal medicines are being preferred over  synthetic drug therapies as an effective remedy for many brain disorders.  Ayurveda provides a holistic approach to treatment along with several nootropic  herbs having multi-dimensional bioactivities in various disorders. Scattered  information is available pertaining to traditional Ayurvedic remedial options  for various mental disorders. Present review encompasses: (i) common brain  disorders and the associated changes (ii) Ayurvedic holistic approach to manage  neurodegenerative and depressive disorders, and (iii) important Ayurvedic single  herbs and polyherbal formulations with description of their traditional usage  and administration. Concomitantly, it opens up for future investigations and  standardization on Ayurvedic nootropic herbs.","According to 'Herbal and Holistic Solutions for Neurodegenerative and Depressive Disorders: Leads from Ayurveda', mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and illnesses like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are a big deal and affect a lot of people. These diseases can lead to other health problems, cause a lot of financial burden and seriously reduce one's quality of life. Lately, more people are turning towards traditional therapies, like herbal medicines, to treat these conditions because they are natural and generally cause fewer side effects than the usual drugs you find at the pharmacy. Ayurveda, a type of traditional medicine, offers a holistic approach, treating the whole person rather than just the disease. It also uses a lot of nootropic herbs,"
"I've been feeling off balance lately, both physically and mentally. Could it have something to do with my lifestyle or diet?","Because the disharmony of mental doshas (satogun, rajogun, and tamogun) and body  doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha) are the major cause of illness, the goal of  illness management in Ayurveda is to bring back harmony among the doshas. The  management includes clinical examination, diagnosis, and dietary and lifestyle  interventions and treatment. The clinical examination consists of Astha Sthana  Pariksha (8-point diagnosis: pulse-diagnosis, urine, stool, tongue, voice and  body sound, eye, skin, and total body appearance examinations) and examination  of the digestive system and the patient's physical strength. The treatment  consists of cleansing (Panchkarma), palliation (improve digestion, remove toxic  waste, fasting, observe thirst, exercise, sunbathing, and meditation), mental  nurturing, and spiritual healing depending on the disturbed doshas and the  patient's constitution. The preferred use of bhasms and herbal formulas over the  respective metallic salts or the single herbs is discussed. This review suggests  a great potential for integration of Ayurvedic therapies into the healthcare  system in the United States.","According to 'Healthcare and disease management in Ayurveda', your body and mind need to be in balance to stay healthy. If you're feeling out of whack, an Ayurvedic approach might help. This could include a check-up that looks at different aspects like your pulse, pee, poop, tongue, voice, eyes, skin, and overall look. There's also a focus on your digestion and physical strength. The treatment could involve a mix of things like detoxing, improving digestion, fasting, exercising, sunbathing, and meditating. It might also recommend using special herbal blends instead of single herbs or metallic salts. This traditional Indian way of healing has a lot of potential to be part of healthcare in the U.S."
I've been feeling really stressed out lately. Could ayurvedic practices help me manage my stress levels better?,"The ancient medicine of India (ayurveda) is a broadly conceptualized  anthropology embracing the whole human being without the Western body/soul  dualism. A symptomatology based on careful observation leads, in conjunction  with etiology, pathogenesis and pathology, with constitutional and personality  features, to a differentiated nosology. This broad concept is matched by  multidimensional therapy embracing pharmacologic, surgical, psychotherapeutic  and ""paramedical"" measures. Ayurveda (""life knowledge"") is a combination of  religious, philosophical, anthropological, medical and psychological concepts.  It is impressive how accurate the knowledge and description of psychiatric  diseases already was 2,500 years ago, and how little these phenomena have  changed with time. The therapeutic armamentarium (paramedical, psychotherapeutic  and pharmacologic) of ayurveda psychiatry has not yet been sufficiently studied  by scientific methods.","According to ""Ayurveda"", the ancient Indian practice of medicine considers the person as a whole, rather than separating the body and the mind like Western medicine often does. It's pretty impressive how accurately they described mental health conditions over 2,000 years ago, and how their descriptions still apply today. Their treatments involved a mix of things like medicine, surgery, and therapy, but also other factors that aren't typically considered in Western medicine. However, we still need more scientific research to fully understand these methods."
I've been feeling super stressed and anxious lately. Could Ashwagandha help me chill out and feel better?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, commonly known as  Ashwagandha, is an important medicinal plant that has been used in Ayurvedic and  indigenous medicine for more than 3000 years. According to Charaka Samhita,  Susruta Samhita and other ancient texts, Ashwagandha is known as Balya  (increases strength), Brusya (sexual performance enhancer), vajikari  (spermatogenic), Kamarupini (libido-enhancing), Pustida (nourishing). AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review article documented and critically assessed W.  somnifera regarding its ethnopharmacology, traditional use, botanical  description, phytochemicals present, pharmacological activities, clinical  trials, and marketed formulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sources of information used in the study are  traditional Ayurvedic books like Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Astanga  Hridaya etc, government reports, dissertations, books, research articles and  databases like Science-Direct, SciFinder, Web of Science, PubMed, Wiley Online  Library, and ACS Publications on Ashwagandha and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal. RESULTS: Traditional uses of Ashwagandha in Ayurveda are very prominent in  several texts where formulations with various dosage forms have been mentioned  in Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Astanga Hridaya, different nighantus etc.  The drugs were identified based on their composition containing Ashwagandha as  one of the major ingredients and their medicinal uses. Phytochemical studies on  W. somnifera revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as  flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and withanolides. The  phytochemicals showed various pharmacological activities like anti-cancer,  immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-aging,  anti-stress/adaptogenic and anti-diabetic. Various clinical trials show that the  plant extract and its bioactive compounds are used in the prevention and  treatment of many diseases, such as arthritis, impotence, amnesia, anxiety,  cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological data reviewed here revealed that W. somnifera is a  potential source for the treatment of a wide range of diseases especially  anxiety and other CNS disorders. From its ancient use to its modern application  it has been proven to be non-toxic and effective clinically for human health and  wellness. W. somnifera based herbal formulation has been marketed in the form of  supplement, extract, capsule, powder etc. This review will be helpful to  correlate the mechanism of action with the phytochemical profile of this  well-known plant from Ayurveda.","According to 'Withania somnifera (L.)

I get bitten by mosquitos a lot. Are there any natural remedies I can use to protect myself?,"Using key informants and available records, the way in which inhabitants of  purana villages in Nuwarakalaviya, Sri Lanka coped with malaria during the  pre-DDT era is examined. This study found that the Nuwarakalaviya peasants  responded to endemic malaria through a localized herbal tradition, which was to  some extent independent of the scholarly ayurveda system common to the whole of  South Asia. The relevant herbal tradition, consisting of a combination of  antiparasite and antivector strategies using locally available natural  resources, represented an effective adaptation to the local ecosystem.","According to 'Ayurveda, malaria and the indigenous herbal tradition in Sri Lanka', villagers in Sri Lanka used to deal with malaria by using local herbs and natural resources. This wasn't just about following ancient medicine traditions, but about using what was available around them to fight both the disease and the bugs that spread it. Kinda like using nature's own bug spray and medicine cabinet."
"So, I heard researchers are looking into traditional medicine for Covid-19 treatment. What's the deal with using Ayurveda and modern science together?","As the search for effective treatment for Covid-19 intensifies, traditional  medicine systems are receiving increasing attention from researchers as well as  the public. While scientific rigour is non-negotiable, there remain fundamental  issues to be addressed when bringing evidence from traditional systems. Here we  examine some of these issues pertaining to Ayurveda and the underlying  philosophical underpinnings, and suggest potential ways to move forward. We find  an ability to emerge from the cage of ""biomedicalism"" and its foundational  reductionism essential for appropriate research in Ayurveda. We caution against  pursuing research in Ayurveda by just mimicking modern medicine and highlight  the need for appropriate use of modern science tools and methods to understand  Ayurveda and explore its potential for healthcare. We emphasise the need and  potential for transdisciplinary research in Ayurveda. A balance between  evidence-based medicine and evidence-informed healthcare is required.","According to 'Research, biomedicine and Ayurveda: From evidence-based medicine to evidence-informed healthcare', scientists are looking at traditional medicine like Ayurveda for possible Covid-19 treatments. But it's not as simple as just copying modern medicine methods. They've got to use the right tools and methods, and not get stuck only in the way of thinking used in western medicine. The research should be balanced, not just focused on hard evidence, but also on how it can be used to improve healthcare."
I've got these annoying little bumps on my arms and thighs that won't go away. Could it be something like Keratosis Pilaris and how can I treat it if creams and lotions aren't working?,"OBJECTIVES: Keratosis pilaris (KP) is the condition of the skin with extensive  keratin follicular plugging. It may be associated with the erythema. The upper  arm extensor area, shoulders, back of neck and thighs, as well as face and the  upper trunk are the areas of presentation. Available medications for KP give  only symptomatic relief, while some produce serious side effects. There is no  proven universal treatment for the disease that can provide complete recovery.  Āyuṛveda management of KP is not yet reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old male patient, presented with main complaints  started with papular lesions over his right shoulder, chest and upper back along  and later with pustular lesions in the past 2 weeks. The condition was  associated with redness, mild swelling and itching. The case was diagnosed as  Keratosis pilaris based on its presentation, site, and pathogenesis. Also by  analyzing the extent of vitiation of doṣas (morbidities), the Vata kapha pitta  hara line of treatment was adopted, which was accomplished in two phases i. e.  Śodhana Cikitsa and Śamana Cikitsa. CONCLUSION: Both internal and external treatments along with diet restrictions  were found effective in arresting the pathogenesis and recovery in a short  period. All the symptoms associated with the condition were completely cured  with no signs of re-occurrence.","According to 'Āyuṛveda management of keratosis pilaris - a case report', Keratosis pilaris, a skin condition that causes rough patches and small, acne-like bumps, doesn't have a one-size-fits-all treatment. But this study found that a combination of specific internal and external treatments from Ayurveda, along with some dietary changes, helped a guy completely recover from it. The bumps and redness totally went away and didn't come back. So, for anyone struggling with this annoying skin issue, Ayurvedic treatment might be worth looking into."
I've been having some weird reactions to certain foods lately. Does Ayurveda have any tips on how to deal with food allergies or intolerances?,"Food allergy being a common health problem needs attention. The experience of  Ayurveda can be utilized to accelerate our understanding and management of food  allergies and related phenomenon like allergic tension fatigue syndrome,  intolerance and indigestion associated with certain foods. Prevention of food  allergies by carefully selecting the foods in accordance with the individual's  body constitution and seasonal alterations, is considered as the best strategy  in Ayurveda. If possible, the concept of prakriti and properties of food as  described in Ayurveda, should be interpreted in modern terminology. Moreover, to  scientifically validate them, an appropriate correlation with modern concepts is  required along with scientific studies on modern parameters. Rasayanas may also  prove helpful in the management of food allergies. It is obvious that there, is  an urgent need for multidimensional and planned investigations of these  Ayurvedic rasayanas in management of food allergies. The clinical acceptability  of rasayanas for the treatment of food allergies entirely rests on such studies.  Food intolerance and allergies are common health problems which are difficult to  diagnose and still more difficult to treat. This problem is well addressed in  Ayurveda and guidelines are available for their management. This paper aims to  present the Ayurvedic concepts in the management of food intolerance/ allergies  and its correlation with the evidences available from modem scientific  laboratories. The understanding of this ancient wisdom may prove to be of  immense importance in patient care.","According to 'Food allergies--leads from Ayurveda', food allergies and intolerances are common health issues that can be tricky to diagnose and even harder to treat. But Ayurveda, an ancient medical practice, might have some answers. It suggests that the best way to prevent food allergies is by choosing foods that match your body type and the current season. The study also talks about 'rasayanas', which are believed to help manage food allergies. However, more research is needed to understand these concepts fully in modern science terms. So, in simple words, paying attention to what and when you eat according to your body constitution could help manage your food allergies."
I've heard that Ayurveda has some cool insights about the body. Could it potentially offer natural ways to boost cardiovascular health?,"Ayurveda, the native healthcare system of India, is a rich resource of  well-documented ancient medical knowledge. Although the roots of this knowledge  date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a  dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between  400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these  early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among  the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda  have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine.  In this communication, the discovery of blood circulation has been taken up as a  case, and a few important references from the representative Ayurveda compendia  that hint at a preliminary understanding of the cardiovascular system as a  ""closed circuit"" and the heart acting as a pump have been reviewed. The central  argument of this review is that these contributions from Ayurveda too must be  recorded and credited when reviewing the milestones in the history of medicine,  as Ayurveda can still possibly guide various streams of the current sciences, if  revisited with this spirit.","According to 'The history of the discovery of blood circulation: unrecognized contributions of Ayurveda masters', Ayurveda is an ancient healthcare system from India that has a lot of cool knowledge about medicine. Even though it's been around for thousands of years, it's often overlooked in medical history because a lot of its early texts were written in Sanskrit, a language not many people use today. The paper highlights how Ayurveda texts showed an understanding of how the heart and blood circulation work way before modern medicine did. So, the paper suggests that we should give Ayurveda its due credit when talking about the history of medicine, and hey, we might even learn a thing or two from it for our current medical practices."
I've heard a lot about natural remedies recently. Are there any ancient health care systems that use plants or other natural resources that could help improve my well-being?,"Biodiversity of natural resources has served not only for the primary human  needs but also for health care, since time immemorial. The Indian subcontinent,  with the history of one of the oldest civilization, harbors many traditional  health care systems. Their development was supported by the diverse biodiversity  in flora and fauna due to variations in geographical landscaping. Ayurveda,  whose history goes back to 5000 b.c., is one of the ancient health care systems.  The Ayurveda was developed through daily life experiences with the mutual  relationship between mankind and nature. The ancient text of Ayurveda reports  more than 2000 plant species for their therapeutic potentials. Besides Ayurveda,  other traditional and folklore systems of health care were developed in the  different time periods in Indian subcontinent, where more than 7500 plant  species were used. According to a WHO estimate, about 80% of the world  population relies on traditional systems of medicines for primary health care,  where plants form the dominant component over other natural resources. Renewed  interest of developing as well as developed countries in the natural resources  has opened new horizons for the exploration of natural sources with the  perspectives of safety and efficacy. The development of these traditional  systems of medicines with the perspectives of safety, efficacy and quality will  help not only to preserve this traditional heritage but also to rationalize the  use of natural products in the health care. Until recent past, the nature was  considered as a compendium for templates of new chemical entities (NCEs). The  plant species mentioned in the ancient texts of these Ayurveda and other Indian  systems of medicines may be explored with the modern scientific approaches for  better leads in the health care.","According to 'Integrated approaches towards drug development from Ayurveda and other Indian system of medicines', the use of plants and natural remedies for healthcare has been a thing for thousands of years. In India, they use over 7500 different types of plants in their traditional healthcare systems, like Ayurveda. It's like how we use aloe vera for sunburns or drink chamomile tea to sleep better. In fact, about 80% of the world's population uses these types of traditional plant-based remedies for their health care. There's a growing interest in these natural remedies because they can be effective and safe. Some of these ancient plant remedies could even lead to the development of new modern medicines."
I've heard a lot about Ayurveda and was thinking of trying it out. Should I be worried about any dangerous ingredients in their medicinal plants?,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) show a hazardous potential for humans and animals.  They can possess mutagenic, teratogenic, cancerogenic and fetotoxic properties.  One pathway of a human intoxication can be the use of medicinal plants which  contain toxic PAs. The Traditional Indian medicine--in particular Ayurveda--is a  popular and well-known healing system. Within this system several PA-containing  plants are used which, on account of their PA level, represent a severe health  risk. In general, it is not recommended to use plants containing those toxic  compounds.","According to 'Plants containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids used in the traditional Indian medicine--including ayurveda', some plants used in traditional Indian medicine, including Ayurveda, can actually be harmful. These plants contain something called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which can lead to some serious health risks. So, it's a good idea to be cautious and avoid using plants with these toxic compounds."
"I've heard a bit about Ayurveda before, but what exactly is this Rasashaastra thing and how can it be used for health treatments?","The word Rasashaastra literally means the ""Science of Mercury"". It is a  specialized branch of Ayurveda dealing mainly with materials which are known as  'Rasa dravyaas'. The products dealt under this discipline are an important  component of Ayurvedic therapeutics. Considering the importance of this  discipline in Ayurvedic therapeutics and the fact that there is dearth of  comprehensive review on the subject an attempt has been made in this review to  provide a brief but all encompassing coverage of different aspects related to  it. The subjects covered in the review are: historical background of the  evolvement of Rasashaastra as a specialized branch during different time  periods; different aspects of classification 'Rasa dravyaas'; processing of  metal and mineral products with a note on the methods used during different time  periods; information about methods of pre and post preparation procedures for  different kinds of 'Rasa dravyaas'; importance of mercury in Ayurveda, its  processing methods and different preparations along with therapeutic  indications. In addition attempt has been made to provide basic information on  the metal and mineral based preparations mentioned in Ayurvedic Formulary of  India; recent development in the field of Rasashaastra and future requirements  for the proper development of the discipline. The main focus is to familiarize  the readers, from non-ayurvedic background, on different aspects of this  specialized discipline.","According to 'Introduction to 'Rasashaastra' the Iatrochemistry of Ayurveda', Rasashaastra is basically the 'Science of Mercury' and a special part of Ayurveda. It focuses on unique substances called 'Rasa dravyaas' which are a big deal in Ayurvedic treatments. The study tries to give a full overview of this, from its history, how 'Rasa dravyaas' are classified and made, to the role of mercury in Ayurveda. So, imagine it like a guide to a special Ayurvedic recipe book where mercury is a star ingredient. It also talks about recent updates in this field and what's needed for its growth."
"So, I've heard that traditional medicines can actually be pretty effective. Any truth to this?","Drug discovery strategies based on natural products and traditional medicines  are re-emerging as attractive options. We suggest that drug discovery and  development need not always be confined to new molecular entities. Rationally  designed, carefully standardized, synergistic traditional herbal formulations  and botanical drug products with robust scientific evidence can also be  alternatives. A reverse pharmacology approach, inspired by traditional medicine  and Ayurveda, can offer a smart strategy for new drug candidates to facilitate  discovery process and also for the development of rational synergistic botanical  formulations.","According to 'Traditional medicine-inspired approaches to drug discovery: can Ayurveda show the way forward?', drug discovery doesn't always have to be about creating something completely new. In fact, traditional medicines like Ayurveda can be a great source of inspiration. By carefully studying these ancient practices and creating standardized herbal mixtures, we might actually find effective treatments for various health issues. It's kind of like looking back to move forward in medicine."
I've heard a bit about this Ayurvedic detox thing called panchakarma. Can you tell me more about it and how it might help with dental health?,"This article, the fourth in the series titled 'Dentistry and Ayurveda,'  describes in brief the panchakarma therapy, which is a distinctive feature of  the Ayurvedic method of detoxifying the body. The various therapies and  medicines used in Ayurveda have been elaborated. Further, an attempt has been  made to correlate dental diseases in Ayurveda with the modern-day  classification, clinical features, and management.","According to 'Dentistry and Ayurveda - IV: classification and management of common oral diseases', Ayurveda, an old-school method of medicine, uses a special kind of detox called panchakarma therapy. This study tries to connect how Ayurveda looks at dental diseases with the way we categorize and treat them today. It's kind of like looking at how our grandparents' remedies stack up against modern dentistry."
Could traditional Indian medicine like Ayurveda help with my chronic joint pain since regular medicine doesn't seem to do much?,"Although many drugs have been developed by pharmaceutical companies, there are  many diseases which can not be cured with these drugs. In order to overcome this  problem, the combination of Western and Eastern medicine has been proposed.  Ayurveda is traditional Indian medicine established B.C. and is accepted  throughout the world today. Due to its effectiveness and fewer side effects,  Ayurveda will provide us with many hints for drug development. In the present  review, we discuss the possible application of Ayurveda in drug development  taking into account the following two points, i) herbs used in Ayurveda contain  many unknown active components, and ii) Ayurveda provides new therapeutic  approaches. In the case of drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis, we get  hints from active components in the herbs used in Ayurveda. For rheumatism, we  obtain hints for new pharmacological approaches from this medicinal approach.","According to 'Drug development with hints from traditional Indian Ayurveda medicine: hepatitis and rheumatoid as an example', there are some diseases that current medicines can't fully handle. To find better solutions, researchers are looking at Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical practice that's still popular today. They think that the herbs used in Ayurveda could be a goldmine for creating new drugs, especially for chronic conditions like hepatitis and rheumatism. This is because these herbs might have active ingredients that we haven't discovered yet. So, who knows? The cure for some tough diseases could be hiding in the recipes of this age-old tradition."
I keep hearing about Ayurveda for health and wellness. Can you tell me what the big deal is and why some people criticize it?,"This is my response to several recent criticisms that have challenged my views  expressed in the article 'Confessions of an Ayurveda Professor' in this journal  [1]. Some of these criticisms, such as the one by Karthik and Shajin, are  directly expressed [2], while others, such as the one by Tubaki and Prasad, are  indirect [3]. The criticism by Tubaki and Prasad is particularly significant  because it is the only feedback I have received from the Ayush establishment  thus far; and lists the President of the Board of Ayurveda, National Commission  for Indian System of Medicine (NCISM), as an author. Additionally, there have  been many reactions published on IJME's website. I also address them in this  response since many of them share a similar line of thinking.","According to 'A case for testing and modifying theory in Ayurveda: Author's response', the author is responding to some criticisms about his previous article on Ayurveda. Some people gave direct feedback, and others were a bit more roundabout. One notable feedback came from a big shot in the Ayurveda world. The author also addresses some comments which were posted online, as many of them had the same general idea."
"So, can I use Ayurvedic remedies along with regular meds to recover faster from COVID-19?","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by the severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patients with COVID-19 may  be treated with traditional medicine like Ayurveda alone or in combination with  standard allopathic treatment, as Ayurveda is one of the oldest traditional  medicinal systems followed by millions around the world. METHODS: The literature was searched in databases such as LitCOVID, Google  Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCO, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and reference  lists to identify articles relevant to the use of Ayurvedic medicines in the  management of COVID-19. RESULTS: Several clinical studies have determined the efficacy of Ayurvedic  medicines and formulations in the management of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The Ayurvedic medicines and formulations with antiviral,  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties could be used  along with standard allopathic medicines to assist in the earlier detection of  virus, speedy recovery of patients with COVID-19, faster discharge from  hospitals, and the prevention of further deterioration.","According to 'An Insight of Clinical Evidence of Ayurveda Interventions in the Management of COVID-19 Patients', it seems that traditional Ayurvedic medicine might actually help in treating COVID-19. These natural remedies, which have been used for centuries, can potentially work alongside modern medicine to help detect the virus earlier, get you out of the hospital faster, prevent your condition from getting worse, and speed up your recovery. Some of the benefits come from these remedies having antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, and being able to boost your immune system."
I've heard a lot about Ayurveda on TV and in newspapers. Is it actually effective for long-term health issues?,"Background Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine, has been practised in India  since ages. We evaluated the overall awareness regarding Ayurveda among patients  attending two specialty clinics at a tertiary care institute. Methods We did a  cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics  at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using  a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed  using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed  to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among  them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that  Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations  (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%).  Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and  newspaper advertisements (13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined  that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of  participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be  beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had  Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to  participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine.  Conclusion Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail  in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed. We found imprecise  knowledge of Ayurvedic therapies and its low usage among patients attending  specialized OPDs in a tertiary care hospital. The major source of information  reported was promotional advertisements in the print and electronic media. Our  survey shows a need for awareness programmes for general public at various  levels.","According to 'Knowledge, attitude and practice towards Ayurveda among patients attending cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care institute in India', a lot of people know about Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, but their knowledge is a bit fuzzy. Most people in the study thought Ayurveda included herbal drugs and some other therapies, but they didn't really get it all. Most of their info came from TV ads and newspapers. Even though not many people in the study were using Ayurveda, a lot of them thought it would be cool if a major medical institute in India offered Ayurveda services. Most were also open to being part of research that combines Ayurveda with modern medicine. The takeaway? People need"
"I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda recently. How can it help with my mental health struggles, especially when compared to traditional therapy or medication?","Under the aegis of the World Health Organization, the Movement for Global Mental  Health and an Indian Supreme Court ruling, biomedical psychiatric interventions  have expanded in India augmenting biomedical hegemony in a place that is known  for its variety of healing modalities. This occurs despite the fact that studies  by the WHO show better outcomes in India for people suffering from schizophrenia  and related diagnoses when compared to people in developed countries with  greater access to biomedical psychiatry. Practitioners of ayurvedic medicine in  Kerala have been mounting a claim for a significant role in public mental health  in the face of this growing hegemony.This study examines efforts by ayurvedic  practitioners to expand access to ayurvedic mental health services in Kerala,  and profiles a rehabilitation center which combines biomedical and ayurvedic  therapies and has been a key player in efforts to expand the use of Ayurveda for  mental health. The paper argues for maintaining a pluralistic healing  environment for treating mental illness rather than displacing other healing  modalities in favor of a biomedical psychiatric approach.","According to 'Hegemony versus pluralism: Ayurveda and the Movement for Global Mental Health', there's been a big shift in India towards using more Western-style mental health treatments. This is happening even though some studies, like ones from the World Health Organization, show that Indian methods like Ayurveda might actually work better for some conditions, like schizophrenia. Some Ayurveda doctors in Kerala, India, are trying to push back and get their traditional mental health treatments more recognized and used. One center in Kerala is even mixing both Western and Ayurvedic treatments. The paper argues that it's better to have a mix of different treatments available for mental health, rather than just pushing the Western approach."
I've heard about Ayurveda and personalized diets. Can they actually help me to feel healthier and more balanced?,"Within the disciplines of modern medicine, P4 medicine is emerging as a new  field which focuses on the whole patient. The development of Ayurgenomics could  greatly enrich P4 medicine by providing a clear theoretical understanding of the  whole patient and a practical application of ancient and modern preventative and  therapeutic practices to improve mental and physical health. One of the most  difficult challenges today is understanding the ancient concepts of Ayurveda in  terms of modern science. To date, a number of researchers have attempted this  task, of which one of the most successful outcomes is the creation of the new  field of Ayurgenomics. Ayurgenomics integrates concepts in Ayurveda, such as  Prakriti, with modern genetics research. It correlates the combination of three  doshas, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, with the expression of specific genes and  physiological characteristics. It also helps to interpret Ayurveda as an ancient  science of epigenetics which assesses the current state of the doshas, and uses  specific personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations to improve a patient's  health. This review provides a current update of this emerging field.","According to 'Ayurgenomics and Modern Medicine,' scientists are blending old and new approaches to health. They're using Ayurgenomics, which combines ideas from Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine from India, with modern genetic research. Basically, it's like understanding your body type according to Ayurveda, and then using that info to figure out what genes might be making you act a certain way. This could help them make personalized diet and lifestyle suggestions to boost your health. It's a bit like having a tailored workout and meal plan, but it's based on both your DNA and ancient knowledge. This field is still pretty new, but it's looking promising for managing your mental and physical health in a holistic way."
"I'm not really happy with the healthcare I'm getting here. Have you ever heard of people going to other countries for different treatments, like Ayurveda in India?","In the past two decades, health care has become a global market and  transnational practice. An emerging body of literature examines the astounding  variety of drivers, conditions, and experiences. However, the question of how  traveling abroad for treatment emerges as an option and takes shape in people's  illness trajectories has gained little attention thus far. This article attends  to this gap by following the stories of people with chronic conditions who  travel to India for Ayurveda treatment out of dissatisfaction with local  biomedical health care. This study expands the focus of current research on  transnational therapeutic mobilities in three ways: (1) by shifting the  attention from being a foreign patient or medical traveler to becoming one, (2)  by integrating quests for other-than-biomedical therapies, and (3) by applying a  narrative approach to the field. Results show that apart from social, human, and  financial resources, it takes certain patient-subjectivities to mobilize  patients across borders and healing systems.","According to 'Of odysseys and miracles: A narrative approach on therapeutic mobilities for Ayurveda treatment', some people with chronic illnesses are so unhappy with their local healthcare that they're actually traveling all the way to India for Ayurveda treatments. This isn't just a simple vacation though - it takes a lot of money, time, and personal drive to make this kind of trip. The study suggests that it's not just about looking for different medical options, but also about the personal journey and becoming a 'medical traveler'."
- I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately. How can its principles help me live a healthier life?,"Brahmavaivartapurana is one of the important Mahapurana, which is considered as  a Vaisnavapurana. The text is divided into four parts called khanda i.e.,  Brahma, Prakrti, Ganapati, and Srikrsnajanmakhanda. The total number of chapters  are 276 and comprising about 20,500 verses. Brahmavaivartapurana comprises both  ancient and medieval materials. It considers Ayurveda as Pancama Veda and  devoted 16th chapter of Brahmakhanda which describes the origin of Ayurveda its  propagaters headed by Bhaskara (sun god) and his 16 students and their  corresponding books in detail. An account of the Jvara (Fever) and other  diseases, Dinacarya (daily routine), Rtucarya (seasonal regimen), Tridosa (three  humours), their Prakopa (Vitiation) and Praśamana (palliation) etc are described  in this book. BVP deals with the do's and dont's of food intake, sleep and  sexual indulgance in detail which are deemed to be Trayopastambha (three sub  pillers of health). The book provides an account of Plant Tulsi's origin and its  spiritual importance. Prakrti (nature's) origins, Pañcamahabhuta nature of the  body are described in Prakrtikhanda. At the flag end of the book there is a  legend describing the origin of Lord Dhanvantari and describes his scholarship  in the field of Veda and śastra. On the whole purana provides glimpse of the  life style of a Vaisnava devoutee and the people of the time when it was  compiled. It serves the purpose of a practical manual to lead a healthy life and  ensure spiritual growth in the life of any individual who believes in the  precepts of this book.","According to ""A review of Brahmavaivartapurana (BVP) with reference to Ayurveda"", the Brahmavaivartapurana is like an ancient guidebook. It talks about Ayurveda, which is kind of like the Indian version of traditional medicine and wellness. The book gives advice on daily routines, seasonal habits, and general health. It even gives tips on what you should eat, how much sleep you should get, and even your love life. Also, it talks a lot about this plant called Tulsi, which it seems was a big deal for health and spirituality. The whole book is kind of a window into what life was like back in the day, not just for religious followers but for anyone who"
"So, I've heard about this Ayurveda stuff. Does it really say that the amount of a guy's semen versus a girl's period blood determines if the baby's a boy or a girl?","As a curious undergraduate studying Ayurveda, the first concept that intrigued  me was Sushruta's take on foetal sex determination. At the time of conception,  if the man's semen is in excess, a male foetus results; if the woman's menstrual  blood is in excess, a female foetus results; if semen and menstrual blood are in  equal measure, an intersex is formed.","According to 'Give truth a chance', an ancient medical text called Ayurveda has this interesting theory about how a baby's sex is determined. The idea is, if there's more of the dad's stuff at the time when the baby is conceived, you'll get a boy. If there's more of the mum's stuff, you'll get a girl. And if there's an equal amount of both, the baby could be intersex."
I've been hearing a lot about this Ayurveda stuff. Does it actually help to change bad habits and improve mental health?,"Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India, is understudied in western  contexts. Using data gathered from an Ayurvedic treatment program, this study  examined the role of psychosocial factors in the process of behavior change and  the salutogenic process. This observational study examined associations with  participation in the 5-day Ayurvedic cleansing retreat program, Panchakarma.  Quality of life, psychosocial, and behavior change measurements were measured  longitudinally on 20 female participants. Measurements were taken before the  start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram.  The program did not significantly improve quality of life. Significant  improvements were found in self-efficacy towards using Ayurveda to improve  health and reported positive health behaviors. In addition, perceived social  support and depression showed significant improvements 3 months postprogram  after the subjects had returned to their home context. As a program of behavior  change, our preliminary results suggest that the complex intervention  Panchakarma may be effective in assisting one's expected and reported adherence  to new and healthier behavior patterns.","According to 'Ayurveda and Panchakarma: measuring the effects of a holistic health intervention', attending a 5-day Ayurvedic retreat, called Panchakarma, might be a great way to kickstart a healthier lifestyle. Though it may not make you instantly happier, the study found that people felt more confident about using Ayurveda to improve their health and started making healthier choices. They also felt more supported by their friends and less depressed three months after the retreat. So, if you're looking to change your habits, this retreat could give you the boost you need."
I've heard about personalized medicine and how it's based on your own body makeup. Does this mean I could potentially get medicine specifically designed for me?,"The ""omics"" era of research has provided vital information on the genetic and  biochemical diversity of individuals. This has lead to the emergence of  ""personalized medicine,"" wherein one aims to design specific drugs for  individual patients or subtypes of patients. Indeed, the ongoing patent wars on  this matter, suggest that personalized medicine represents a major goal for  today's pharmaceutical industries. Although the concept of personalized medicine  is new to modern medicine, it is a well-established concept in Ayurveda, the  traditional system of Indian medicine that is still being practiced. Therefore,  this article discusses topics that are crucial for the advancement of modern  personalized medicine. These topics include disease susceptibility, disease  subtypes, and Ayurvedic therapeutics. First, we explain how Ayurveda,  Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Traditional Korean medicine or Sasang  Constitutional medicine; conceptualize disease susceptibility and disease  subtypes. Next, we focus on conceptual similarities between molecular medicine  and Ayurvedic concepts of disease susceptibility and disease subtypes. For each  topic, we explain the relevant experimental evidence reported in the literature.  We also propose new hypotheses and suggest experimental approaches for their  testing and validation.","According to 'Insights on personalized medicine from Ayurveda', modern medicine is starting to see the benefits of personalized medicine, which is making medicine or treatments that are specifically designed for individuals or certain groups of people. This means instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, doctors could potentially give you better treatments that work specifically for you! This concept is quite common in traditional Indian medicine called Ayurveda. The paper also talks about how different traditional medicines view disease susceptibility and subtypes of diseases. It suggests that there are similarities between these traditional medicine concepts and modern molecular medicine. The paper also mentions that they have evidence to back up these claims and are proposing new ideas to further test and validate these findings."
Does Buddhism offer any tips on healthy living that I could incorporate into my daily routine?,"The Păli canon consists of three Pitakas (baskets), which replete the Buddhism  and is known as Tripiţaka, viz, Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma Piţakas. The  original phase of Tripiţaka (Buddhisim started in 544 B.C. and lastly  systematized up to 29 B.C. The Buddhist literature also possesses the esoteric  material of Medical Science, which is practiced and conserved in India since  centuries. It refers to the fundamentals of medicine, rules of good living,  which lay considerable emphasis on the hygiene of body, mind. Internal Medicine,  curative medicine including symptoms, methods of diagnosis, theories of  causation, materia-medica, therapeutics and treatment and skills of Jivaka. Some  famous and popular prescriptions are also dealt with.","According to 'Ayurvĕda gleaned through Buddhism', Buddhism is not just a religion, but it also has a lot of ancient medical knowledge. The Buddhist texts, which are as old as 544 B.C., talk a lot about how to live a healthy life. They emphasize the importance of taking care of both your physical and mental health, like eating well and keeping stress levels low. These texts also mention Jivaka, who was a famous doctor in ancient times. The texts even include popular prescriptions from that time. So, Buddhism is more than just meditation and philosophy - it's also about understanding and taking care of your body."
"So, I've been feeling kind of off balance lately, like mentally and physically. Could this be related to those body and mental doshas in Ayurveda? How can I get them back in harmony naturally?","Ayurveda, the science of life, is a comprehensive medical system that has been  the traditional system of healthcare in India for more than 5000 years. This  medical system was well established around 2500 to 600 BC, when it evolved into  2 schools: the School of Physicians and the School of Surgeons, similar to  allopathy. Charak Samhita, Susrut Samhita, and Ashtang Hridaya Samhita are the  Senior Triad texts, and Madhav Nidan Samhita, Sarangdhar Samhita, and  Bhavprakash Samhita are the Junior Triad texts. Around 600 BC. Ayurveda was  branched into internal medicine; pediatrics; psychiatry; surgery; eye, ear,  nose, and throat; toxicology; geriatrics; and eugenics/aphrodisiacs. The body is  composed of 3 body doshas, 3 mental doshas, 7 dhatus, and malas. The harmony  among the body doshas of vata (nervous system), pitta (enzymes), and kapha  (mucus) and the gunas, or mental doshas (which are human attributes: satogun  [godly], rajas [kingly], and tamas [evil]), constitutes health, and their  disharmony constitutes disease. The management of illness requires balancing the  doshas back into a harmonious state through lifestyle interventions, spiritual  nurturing, and treatment with herbo-mineral formulas based on one's mental and  bodily constitution.","According to 'Ayurveda: a historical perspective and principles of the traditional healthcare system in India', Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medical system that's been around for over 5,000 years. Think of it like two schools - one for doctors and one for surgeons. It's all about balance, specifically between your body's three doshas, or energies: vata (nervous system), pitta (enzymes), and kapha (mucus). Our mental state also has three doshas: satogun (godly), rajas (kingly), and tamas (evil). When these are balanced, we're healthy. But when they're not, we get sick. To get better, Ayurveda"
"So, I heard about this Ayurveda thing from India, it seems pretty cool. Do you think it could help me lead a healthier lifestyle?","Modern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is  likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it  is practised. The mechanistic model which served biomedicine well for many years  is gradually collapsing, thanks to the efforts of dedicated researchers who have  looked beyond that model's flaws. Thus we now know that networks of chemical  communication exist between the nervous and immune systems, and that prayer at a  distance can positively affect the conditions of those who are seriously ill,  even when the prayer and the patient are not known to one another. Another  participant in this exciting climate of change and ferment is Ayurveda, India's  ancient medical system. While Ayurveda has already contributed much to modern  medicine (reserpine, gugulipid, plastic surgery), its real contributions are yet  to be made. While some of these are likely to come in matters of materia medica  and technique, most will likely be derived from Ayurveda's way of seeing the  world, its ""darshana."" This paper outlines a few of the ways in which Ayurveda's  ""vision"" is likely to facilitate medicine's ability to teach people not just how  to avoid disease but how to proactively develop and maintain a healthy ""state.""","So, according to 'Ayurveda's role in preventing disease', medicine is changing big time, moving away from old-fashioned ways of doing things. Now, doctors and researchers are looking into how the body's systems all work together, and even how things like prayer can help people get better. One cool thing they're looking into is Ayurveda, which is an ancient type of medicine from India that's already given us a bunch of stuff we use today. But the biggest thing it might give us is a new way of looking at health - not just about not getting sick, but about actively staying healthy."
I've heard about this Ayurvedic remedy called Triphala. Could it possibly help with issues like cancer or other diseases?,"Network pharmacology is an emerging technique, which integrates systems biology  and computational biology to study multi-component and multi-targeted  formulations. Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, uses  intelligent formulations; however, their scientific rationale and mechanisms  remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the potential of network  pharmacology to understand the rationale of a commonly used Ayurveda formulation  known as Triphala. We have developed pharmacology networks of Triphala based on  the information gathered from different databases and using the software  Cytoscape. The networks depict the interaction of bioactives with molecular  targets and their relation with diseases, especially cancer. The network  pharmacology analysis of Triphala has offered new relationships among  bioactives, targets and putative applications of cancer etiology. This  pioneering effort might open new possibilities to know pharmacodynamics of  Ayurvedic drugs like Triphala and also help in the discovery of new leads and  targets for various diseases.","According to 'Network Pharmacology of Ayurveda Formulation Triphala with Special Reference to Anti-Cancer Property', the traditional Indian medicine system, Ayurveda, uses complex natural remedies like Triphala that we don't fully understand yet. By using network pharmacology - which is a bit like creating a map of how the different components in a drug interact with the body - scientists have begun to reveal how Triphala might work, especially in relation to diseases like cancer. This could lead to new discoveries and treatments in the future."
"So, I've heard that Ayurveda might have some natural solutions for cancer care. Can you tell me more about that?","An integrated approach is needed to manage cancer using the growing body of  knowledge gained through scientific developments. Thousands of herbal and  traditional compounds are being screened worldwide to validate their use as  anti-cancerous drugs. The science of Ayurveda is supposed to add a step on to  the curative aspects of cancers that have resemblance with clinical entities of  arbuda and granthi mentioned in Sushrutha samhita. Hence, an attempt is made in  this review to discuss about the pathology and therapeutic management of various  cancers described in Ayurveda. Review of literature on anticancer drugs of plant  origin revealed identification of newer ayurvedic drugs that are not mentioned  in the ancient texts. These new findings add up to ayurvedic science that has  been developed through ages. In addition, details of experimental and clinical  studies conducted on single and compound ayurvedic preparations for their  anticancer efficacy strongly emphasize ayurvedic therapy as a scientifically  driven one and not simply unconventional.","According to 'Cancer--an ayurvedic perspective', scientists are looking into traditional and herbal compounds as potential cancer treatments. They're finding some interesting stuff that wasn't even mentioned in ancient Ayurveda texts, suggesting that Ayurveda - the traditional Indian system of medicine - might have more to offer in the fight against cancer. They're also doing experiments on these ayurvedic preparations to see how effective they are. So, Ayurveda isn't just some old-fashioned, unproven thing - it's a science-backed approach that might give us new ways to tackle cancer."
"So, I heard some celebs are into this thing called CAM? What's it all about and what kind of treatments are they using?","OBJECTIVE: To collect contemporary accounts of celebrity use of complementary  and alternative medicine (CAM), to aid clinicians in determining which CAM  treatments patients are likely to use. DESIGN: Articles published during 2005 and 2006 reporting celebrity use of CAM. RESULTS: 38 celebrities were found to use a wide range of CAM interventions.  Homeopathy, acupuncture and Ayurveda were the most popular modalities. CONCLUSIONS: There may be many reasons why consumers use CAM, and wanting to  imitate their idols is one of them.","According to 'Celebrity-based medicine', a lot of celebrities use alternative treatments like homeopathy, acupuncture, and Ayurveda. This might influence some fans to try out these treatments too. So, if your doctor asks if you're using any alternative treatments, they might be trying to understand if you're following any celebrity health trends."
"I've heard a bit about Ayurveda. Is it something that could help me live a healthier lifestyle, both mentally and physically?","Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word derived from two roots: ayur, which means life, and  veda, knowledge. Knowledge arranged systematically with logic becomes science.  During the due course of time, Ayurveda became the science of life. It has its  root in ancient vedic literature and encompasses our entire life, the body,  mind, and spirit.","According to 'An introduction to Ayurveda', Ayurveda is like the science of life. Its name comes from Sanskrit words that mean 'life' and 'knowledge'. This ancient science doesn't just look at your physical health, but also your mental and spiritual well-being. It's a holistic approach that's been around for ages and it involves everything that affects your life."
"I've been using this Ayurvedic medicine I got online to help with my stress levels, but I've been feeling pretty sick lately. Could it have something to do with that?","Ayurveda is a traditional medicine native to India but is used in many parts of  the world as an alternative or adjunct to standard medicine. Preparation can  involve incorporation of heavy metals, including lead. We report the case of a  64-year-old man presenting with malaise, abdominal pain, anaemia and very high  lead levels. He was found to be taking ayurvedic medicines to help his diabetic  control. Analysis of the ayurvedic medications showed several with very high  lead content. Following treatment with an oral chelating agent, the patient's  symptoms and blood abnormalities resolved. This case highlights the need to be  aware of potentially toxic alternative medications patients take and the  efficacy of oral treatment choices in lead poisoning.","According to 'Ayurvedic plumbism', a man got really sick because he was taking traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, to help with his diabetes. Turns out, some of these medicines had a lot of lead in them, which was causing his symptoms. After getting treatment to remove the lead from his body, he got better. So, it's important to be careful about what kind of alternative medicines you take because some could be harmful."
I've heard about this Ayurvedic treatment thing for knee pain. Is it any better than the usual treatments?,"OBJECTIVE: Ayurveda is commonly used in South Asia to treat knee osteoarthritis  (OA). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment compared to  conventional conservative care in patients with knee OA. METHOD: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria knee OA  patients were included in a multicenter randomized, controlled, open-label trial  and treated in 2 hospital clinics and 2 private outpatient clinics in Germany.  Participants received either a multi-modal Ayurvedic treatment or multi-modal  conventional care with 15 treatments over 12 weeks respectively. Primary outcome  was the change on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis  (WOMAC) Index after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales; the  pain disability index and a pain experience scale, numeric rating scales for  pain and sleep quality, quality-of-life and mood, rescue medication use, and  safety issues. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one participants (Ayurveda n = 77, conventional care  n = 74) were included. Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were  more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95%CI: 52.4;69.6])  than in the conventional group (32.0 [95%CI: 21.4;42.6]) resulting in a  significant between-group difference (p < 0.001) and a clinically relevant  effect size (Cohen's d 0.68 [95% CI:0.35;1.01]). Similar trends were observed  for all secondary outcomes at week 12. Effects were sustained at follow-ups  after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that Ayurvedic treatment is beneficial in reducing  knee OA symptoms. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the magnitude  of the effect and to clarify the role of different treatment components and  non-specific effects. REGISTRATION: at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01225133; initial  release 10/06/2010).","According to 'Effectiveness of an Ayurveda treatment approach in knee osteoarthritis - a randomized controlled trial', Ayurveda, a traditional South Asian healing method, can potentially help with knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. This study compared Ayurveda treatments with usual treatments in Germany and found that people who received Ayurveda treatments reported a bigger improvement in their knee pain. These benefits lasted for up to a year. However, more research is needed to confirm these results and understand how exactly the Ayurveda approach works. So, if your knee has been giving you a hard time, Ayurveda might be worth looking into!"
I'm studying Ayurvedic Medicine and we're stuck with really old-school teaching methods. Do you think introducing something like problem-based learning might make classes more engaging and effective?,"Objectives: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a well-known student-centered  instructional approach that is known to enhance problem-solving skills among the  learners. Because teaching/learning methods in most of the Ayurveda colleges in  India are still didactic and teacher centric, the effects of introducing PBL  have not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to develop  PBL modules for Kriya Sharira (Ayurveda Physiology) and their implementation in  a hybrid format. In this method, PBL is used as an add-on component along with  didactic lectures. The secondary objective of the study was to compare the  learning outcomes achieved through hybrid problem-based learning (HPBL) with  those achieved through conventional teaching. Design: This is a prospectively  planned post-test-only, controlled interventional design with nonequivalent  groups. However, the results have been analyzed in a retrospective manner.  Subjects: Students enrolled in the first professional Bachelor of Ayurvedic  Medicine and Surgery program during two consecutive academic sessions 2016-2017  and 2017-2018 at the Banaras Hindu University were included in the study. While  the cohort from 2016 to 2017 session served as the control group, the one from  2017 to 2018 session served as the experimental group. Interventions: The  instructional method commonly known as HPBL was introduced to the experimental  group. Outcome measures: Five test papers containing mostly Multiple Choice  Questions for five different topics were used as the tools for evaluating the  learning outcomes in both the groups. Feedback forms regarding the experiences  of undergoing HPBL were obtained from experimental group. Results: While the  test results for three topics showed that the outcomes of HPBL were comparable  with conventional teaching, the results on other two topics suggested that HPBL  was slightly better. Feedback obtained showed that there is a considerable  acceptance for HPBL over conventional method. Conclusions: The study shows that  it is possible to implement HPBL method in a large classroom in the context of  Ayurveda education. The findings also indicate that students find HPBL as an  acceptable teaching method.","According to 'Introducing Hybrid Problem-Based Learning Modules in Ayurveda Education: Results of an Exploratory Study', a new teaching method, called hybrid problem-based learning, was introduced to Ayurveda students in India. This method mixes traditional lectures with more interactive problem-solving activities. It was tested with two groups of students across two school years. The first group, from 2016 to 2017, was taught in the usual way. The second group, from 2017 to 2018, was taught using this new method. The students' understanding was then tested with multiple-choice questions. The results showed that the new method was just as good as, and sometimes even better than, the traditional method. The students also gave positive"
What's this hot-cold concept in traditional medicine and how could it help me understand my own health better?,"The hot-cold concept is the basis of various traditional medical systems that is  expressed under distinct headings, such as Mizaj and the four humors in Persian  Medicine, Yin and Yang in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Tridoṣa ('Vāta',  'Pitta', and 'Kapha') in Ayurveda. Conventional medicine is facing a growing  demand for personalized medicine. Therefore, clear and comprehensible  information on the foundations and descriptions of traditional medicines, which  take the personalized approach toward maintaining health, prevention and  treatment of the diseases, may help to accelerate this process. This chapter  will explain the physiologic basis of the hot-cold theory in traditional medical  systems via a review of recent studies.","According to 'Hot and Cold Theory: Evidence in Physiology', traditional medicine often uses a 'hot-cold' approach to help keep people healthy and treat illnesses. This is similar to things like Yin and Yang in Chinese medicine, or the three 'doshas' in Ayurveda. Basically, it's all about balance and personalizing the treatment to the individual. Modern medicine is starting to see the value in this personalized approach, so understanding the basics of these traditional methods could be really useful. The paper goes into more detail on how this hot-cold theory works."
"I've been hearing a lot about gut health and its link to overall wellbeing. Could eating a more colorful, plant-based diet like the Indian thali help improve my health?","Diet provides macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), micronutrients  (vitamins and minerals), and phytochemicals (non-nutrient bioactive compounds).  Emerging evidence suggests that above dietary components can directly impact the  composition and metabolic activity of the mammalian gut microbiota and in turn,  affect both physical and mental health. There is a growing recognition that rise  in chronic disease burden in Western countries may due to progressive loss of  beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity. This perspective explores the  possibility of using Indian thali, an ancient approach to diet that provides  both fiber and different phytochemicals by incorporating a variety of plant  foods in different colors. This variety helps to restore diversity in the gut  bacteria and may potentially prevent or reverse chronic disease, such as colon  cancer or type 2 diabetes.","According to 'Ancient Thali Diet: Gut Microbiota, Immunity, and Health', the food you eat can affect not only your body but also your mind by changing the mix of bacteria in your gut. The rise in chronic illnesses like diabetes in Western countries could be due to a lack of good bacteria and diversity in gut bacteria. This paper suggests that an old Indian diet called the thali diet, which is rich in fiber and has a lot of different plant foods, could help restore the diversity of bacteria in your gut and possibly protect against or even reverse chronic diseases, like colon cancer or type 2 diabetes. So, try adding more colorful veggies and fiber-rich foods to your meals!"
Are there any specific spices I can add to my meals that might help improve my mental health or brain function?,"India has traditionally been known to all over the world for spices and  medicinal plants. Spices exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. In  contemporary, Indian spices are used to rustle up delicious delicacies. However,  the Indian spices are more than just adjuvant which adds aroma and fragrance to  foods. A few spices are very widely used and grown commercially in many  countries, contain many important chemical constituents in the form of essential  oil, oleoresin, oleogum, and resins, which impart flavor, pungency, and color to  the prepared dishes, simultaneously exerts diverse therapeutic benefits.  Ayurveda, the traditional systems of medicine in India has many evidences for  the utilization of spices to cure various diseases. Some of the activities have  been scientifically proven. Among various indications central nervous system  disorders are of prime importance and it has been evident in traditional books  and published reports that spices in fact protect and cure neuronal ailments.  Likewise there are many spices found in India used for culinary purpose and have  been found to have reported specific activities against brain disorders. About  400 B.C., Hippocrates rightly said ""Let food be thy medicine and medicine thy  food."" This review focuses on the importance of spices in therapeutics and the  till date scientific findings of Indian spices in CNS pharmacology and explores  the potential of Indian spices to cure CNS disorders.","According to 'Spices: Potential Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease', spices from India aren't just for making your food taste better. They also have health benefits, and some of them could even help with diseases that affect the brain. Just like Hippocrates said a long time ago, ""Let food be thy medicine and medicine thy food."" So next time you're cooking, throw in some extra spices - they might do more than just spice up your meal."
So this professor thinks that parts of Ayurveda are outdated. Do you think there are any old-school health practices that are still useful today?,"""Confessions of an Ayurveda Professor"", by Kishor Patwardhan, published in IJME,  has set the stage for heated discussions within and outside the medical circles.  It uses primitive philosophical criteria to argue that Ayurvedic principles  relating to anatomy and physiology are obsolete, and that they need to be  removed from the syllabus.

I've been having joint pain lately. Could my diet be causing it and how can I use Ayurveda to help?,"The fundamental principles of Ayurveda are briefly reviewed. The ancient  classification of arthritis is described along with the comparisons to the  modern system. Though the diagnosis is historical and clinical, it is based on  the tridosha hypothesis. The Ayurvedic pathogenesis links arthritis to the gut.  Management chiefly consists of diet and lifestyle changes, the panchkarma  process, and herbal drugs. The rasayana concept of immunomodulation is  introduced. Clinical ethno-validation of the ancient therapy is necessary to  meet the modern requirements and set up an interface with modern medicine.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine and arthritis', Ayurveda, which is an ancient medical system, has its own way of understanding and treating arthritis. It believes that arthritis is connected to your gut health. The Ayurvedic approach to managing arthritis doesn't just involve taking herbal medicines, but also includes changes in your diet and lifestyle, as well as a special detoxification process called panchkarma. There's also this cool concept of boosting your immune system, known as rasayana. However, to make sure this old-school therapy fits modern needs, it needs to be validated with clinical studies. This will help it blend better with today's medical practices."
"I heard about this Ayurvedic thing called Swarna Prashana that's supposed to boost kids' health. Can it do the same for me, even though I'm no longer a kid?","Childhood needs diverse nutritional requirements. Poor appetite, lifestyle  changes, and poor digestion affects child immunity and make them prone to  diseases. Kaumarabhritya, a branch of Ayurveda which deals in child and  adolescent health care, has a unique concept of Swarna Prashana (SP) to promote  generalized immunity and intellect. SP is commonly recommended to children  between 0 and 12 years of age and given as a general health promoter to improve  intellect, digestion, strength, immunity, longevity, and complexion. Multiple  benefits of SP are mentioned in different Samhitas which needs to be explored on  scientific background. Authors have highlighted content variabilities, plausible  mechanisms, research tasks and potentials, lacunae, and future prospects about  SP.

"So, who exactly was this Sŏdhala dude and how have his works influenced modern natural medicine?","Sŏdhala was a scholar of Ayurvĕda as well as săhitya, Jyotisya, Vyakaraņa and  also a good poet who belongs to Gujarat. Sŏdhala contributed two important works  to Ayurvĕda literature namely 1. Sŏdhbala nighaņţu, 2. Gadanigraha. Sŏdhala  nighaņţu consists of two parts and contains about 2,050 (790+1,260) verses. The  section on synonyms, the Nămasangraha, and the other one is on properties and  actions of drugs, the Guņasangraha. The arrangement of the material constitutes  an unprecedented innovation in the literature of Nighaņţu (Ayurvĕda drug's  lexicons or dictionaries). The Gadanigraha is composed of two distinct parts and  contains about 10,054 (2,700+7,354) verses. The first part is a collection of  formulae arranged according to the several types of pharmaceutical preparations  and the second one is a comprehensive text dealing with both Nidăna and cikitsă,  arranged as for the Aşţăngas (8 major divisions) of Ayurvĕda. The work seems to  be later than Sŏdhalanighaņţu because most of the drugs mentioned in this work  are not found in the Sŏdhalanighaņţu. The diseases are arranged in  systematically, which is a new feature and their order is differ from  Mădhavanidăna. From the available evidences we can assume that Sŏdhala might be  belongs to 1200 A.D.

Is there any advice in the Garudapurăna or other purănas about natural or holistic ways to stay healthy?,"The Purănas are the encyclopedic works of the ancient and medieval Hindu  religion, philosophy, history, politics, ethics, sciences etc. There are 18  (Astădaśa) purănas, which are, considered as mahăpurănas, among which  Garudapurăna is popular one. The Garudapurăna is divided into two parts viz.,  Pŭrvakhanda and Uttarakhanda. The first part, which is also called Acărakhanda  consists of 240 chapters. The greater part of the Pŭrvakhanda occupies the  descriptions of Vratas (religious observances), sacred places dedicated to the  Sŭrya (sun), Lord Siva and Lord Visnu. It also contains treatises on various  aspects like astrology, palmistry, politics, Sănkhya, Yŏga, anatomy, precious  stones and extensive information on vedic medicine i.e., Ayurveda. The  Uttarakhanda consists of two khandas viz. Dharmakhanda and Brahmakhanda, which  are divided into 42 and 29 chapters, respectively. The Dharmakhanda is also  known as the Prĕtakalpa which contains directions for the performance of  obsequies rites. The Prĕtakalpa portion of the Garudapurăna is generally recited  during the period of mourning and so its importance is self-evident. It is  almost impossible to narrate within such a small framework, the wide range of  splendid truths scattered in the pages of this noble purănam. Little information  is available from internal evidence to establish its exact period. However, it  is supposed to be quite ancient in its origin.","According to 'Introduction to Garudapurăna with reference to Ayurvĕda', the Garudapurăna is a really old Hindu text that covers a ton of different topics. It's divided into two parts. The first part talks about religious practices, sacred places, and other stuff like astrology, palmistry, politics, yoga, anatomy, precious stones, and Ayurveda - a type of traditional medicine. The second part is about how to perform certain spiritual rituals, especially those related to mourning. The exact time when this text was written is unclear, but it's believed to be super old."
I heard about this Ayurvedic thing called Swarna bindu prashana that's supposed to boost your immune system. Is it safe and does it really work?,"Swarna bindu prashana (SBP) is a metallic medicinal preparation widely used in  Ayurveda pediatrics. The main ingredients of SBP are swarna prashan (gold  nanoparticle), gou ghrita (cow ghee), madhu (honey), and other medhya dravyas  (drugs which enhance intellectual, memory). According to the Indian classical  text, SBP has been proposed as a potent medicine for immunotherapies and vaccine  development due to its indefinite size, shapes, charges, and surface  functionality. In this review, we describe the plausible mechanism of SBP in  dendritic cells maturation and subsequent T cell activation. But being  herbo-metallic preparation, its safety and efficacy are well supported by the  classical publications of Ayurveda. To conclude, SBP is an immune booster for  infants against any viral disease, and it is necessary to validate its safety  and efficacy through systematic methodological research.","According to 'Swarna Bindu Prashana-an Ancient Approach to Improve the Infant's Immunity', Swarna bindu prashana (SBP) is a traditional Indian medicine made from gold particles, cow butter, honey, and some other brain-boosting ingredients. It's often used to help kids' immune systems get stronger and might be useful in creating vaccines. The medicine appears to work by helping certain immune cells develop and activate other immune cells. Even though it has metal in it, old-school Ayurveda texts say it's safe and effective. However, more modern studies are needed to confirm this. So in short, SBP could be a cool way to help protect babies from viral diseases."
What's this Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India I keep hearing about? Is it like a guidebook for natural medicines or something?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) is a  unique book of standards describing the quality, purity and strength of selected  drugs that are manufactured, distributed, and sold by the licensed manufacturers  in pan India. It is developed in two parts; the part one comprises of  mono-monographs of medicinal substances of natural origin and part two includes  selected compound formulations sourced from the schedule - I books under the  Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 comprising of popular Ayurvedic classics of  different period of times. The first part of the Ayurvedic Formulary of India  was published in 1978 and thereafter, the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India  (mono-monograph) Part-I, Vol. I was published in the year 1989 and subsequently,  the other volumes were published with their legalized status under Drugs and  Cosmetics Act, 1940. AIM OF THE STUDY: The study was aimed to bring out the existing knowledge on the  Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia with its chronological development reviewed from the  ancient Vedic Compendia with its continuum in Ayurvedic classics of different  period of time till recent past. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literary search based on the ancient origin of Ayurveda  was carried out. The drug making from the natural resources and utility of the  knowledge exist in classical Ayurvedic works of different period of time till  composition of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India and its importance as  official documents of Govt. of India for Standards of Ayurvedic Drugs and its  perspectives have been discussed. RESULTS: The present paper reviews on the systemic development and different  aspects of drug-making (Pharmacopoeia) with evidence lying in the 5000 years old  work of India. During the systematic review of the various works of different  period of times (ancient, medieval and modern), it was found that the Ayurvedic  Pharmacopoeia of India has its development during 20th Century as an official  document of Govt. of India comprising of single drugs monograph and compound  formulations. CONCLUSION: In India, the development of the Indian Pharmacopoeia started in  20th Century on the recommendation of the Col. R.N. Chopra Committee and in 1978  the first part of the Ayurvedic formulary of India was published. Subsequently,  the amendment in the drugs and cosmetics Act 1940 was brought in 1964 for  regulation of the drugs in Indian Systems of Medicine (Ayurveda, Unani and  Siddha). Later on the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (Mono-Monograph) Part-I,  Volume I, was published in the year 1989 and the other volumes were published  subsequently in different years.","According to 'The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, development and perspectives', the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) is a rulebook for making and selling selected medicines in India.

Existence of paralysis agitans prior to the industrial  revolution is not just of historical interest, but would also suggest that under  the hypothesis of exposure to environmental toxins as a possible cause of  paralysis agitans, natural organic compounds with worldwide distribution should  also be considered.","According to 'Paralysis agitans and levodopa in ""Ayurveda"": Ancient Indian medical treatise', the old Indian medical system, Ayurveda, already knew about Parkinson's disease (here called paralysis agitans or Kampavata) and how to treat it. They used a plant named Mucuna pruriens, which naturally contains levodopa, a drug we still use today to treat Parkinson's. This also means that Parkinson's isn't just a modern disease caused by industrial toxins, but it might also be linked to natural substances found all around the world."

In this article the principles and  practices of Ayurvedic medicine are outlined. In doing so, the safety of  ayurvedic medicine is explored in the context of evidence-based practice and the  implications of Ayurvedic medicine for nursing are discussed. It is concluded  that an awareness of Ayurvedic medicine may help nurses to be cognisant of its  benefits and potential complications if it is used with conventional medicine.  Although the therapeutic value of ayurvedic treatment is yet to be fully  established through randomized control trials, its potential in terms of health  promotion, nutrition and spirituality are acknowledged in the emerging  literature.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine: An introduction for nurses', Ayurveda is an old Indian health practice that's getting more popular because of people's increasing interest in alternative and holistic health approaches. This paper talks about how Ayurveda works and takes a look at how safe it is. While it's not yet fully proven by science, Ayurveda is recognized for its potential benefits in promoting overall wellbeing, nutrition, and spiritual health. If you're considering mixing it with regular medicine, it's important to be aware of potential issues that could pop up. Just something to keep in mind if you're exploring different health practices!"
"So, I've heard that certain herbs can naturally brighten and whiten your skin. Can you tell me more about this and how it works?","BACKGROUND: In Ayurvedic and Unani texts, many herbs and formulations are  mentioned as complexion promoters having skin brightening and whitening effects  that downregulate melanin synthesis. However, with the assistance of  chromatographic techniques, further validation of scientific standardization is  required. OBJECTIVE: To validate individual herbs and formulations in the ancient  literature, some scientific aspects are to be focused on, including  standardization of herbs or herbal products consisting of the active compounds. METHODS: Out of many herbs having complexion promoting properties, three herbs  (Myristica fragrans, Hemidesmus indicus, and Inula racemosa) were selected for  the study. In the present study, validated reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and  high-performance TLC (HPTLC) methods were developed for standardization of the  herbs. RESULTS: It was observed that the quercetin present in M. fragrans was 0.62%  (w/w) with a retention time (Rt) of 6.23 min, the ferulic acid present in H.  indicus was 1.39% (w/w) with an Rt of 8.083 min, and the chlorogenic acid  present in I. racemosa was 1.03% (w/w) with an Rt of 3.19 min. The HPTLC method  showed 1.23% (w/w) of quercetin present in M. fragrans with a retardation factor  (Rf) of 0.48, ferulic acid in H. indicus was 1.52% (w/w) with an Rf of 0.44, and  chlorogenic acid was 1.09% (w/w) in I. racemosa with an Rf of 0.52. CONCLUSIONS: This specific and precise validated method can be useful for the  quality evaluation and quantitative determination of the constituents in  complexion-promoting herbs from Ayurveda and Unani systems of medicine. HIGHLIGHTS: The exploration of complexion promoters from Ayurveda and Unani;  quality evaluation of complexion promoters herbs from Ayurveda and Unani; HPTLC  and RP-HPLC analysis of herbal extracts used and their validation.","According to 'RP-HPLC and HPTLC Methods for Analysis of Selected Herbs Used as Complexion Promoters in Ayurveda and Unani Systems of Medicine', some traditional herbs actually do help in skin brightening and complexion improvement. Three herbs, in particular, were scientifically tested: Myristica fragrans, Hemidesmus indicus, and Inula racemosa. It turns out these herbs do contain compounds that can help improve skin complexion. So, ancient beauty secrets might actually have some scientific backing!"
My grandma has dementia and it's really hard to see her struggle. Are there any natural remedies or treatments that could help her feel better?,"Dementia has been characterized by atypical neurological syndromes and several  cognitive deficits, such as extended memory loss, strange behavior, unusual  thinking, impaired judgment, impotence, and difficulty with daily living  activities. Dementia is not a disease, but it is caused by several  neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lewy's bodies.  Several drugs and remedies are indicated for alleviating unusual cognitive  decline, but no effective pharmacological treatment regimens are available  without side effects. Herbal drugs or traditional medicines like Ayurveda have  been known for facilitating and corroborating the balance between mind, brain,  body, and environment. Ayurvedic therapy comprises 600 herbal formulas, 250  single plant remedies, and natural and holistic health-giving treatments that  relieve dementia in patients and increase vitality. Ayurvedic Rasayana herbs  [rejuvenating elements] strengthen the brain cells, enhance memory, and decrease  stress. The current medicine scenario in the treatment of dementia has prompted  the shift in exploring the efficacy of ayurvedic medicine, its safety, and its  efficiency. This review presents the literature on several herbal treatments for  improving dementia symptomatology and patients' quality of life.","According to 'Ayurvedic Herbal Therapies: A Review of Treatment and Management of Dementia', dementia is a tough condition that messes with people's memory, behavior, and ability to do everyday tasks. It's not a disease itself but is caused by other brain conditions like Alzheimer's. Modern medicine doesn't have a perfect solution for it yet, and most treatments come with unwanted side effects. However, traditional medicine like Ayurveda, which uses lots of natural herbs and treatments, may offer some hope. It's said to help balance the mind, brain, and body, and can potentially ease dementia symptoms and improve a person's quality of life. Certain Ayurvedic herbs, known as Rasayana herbs, may even boost memory"
I've heard about Ayurveda and thought it was just one thing. Is it actually more diverse and can it be adjusted to my personal health needs?,"This paper argues that because Ayurveda is commonly approached as a single  coherent tradition of medicine characterized predominately by the doctrines,  clinical practitioners, and medical infrastructure that supports it, the rich  diversity of empirical indigenous medicine available in the daily lives of the  Sinhalese is often obscured. Thus the numbers of IMPs, the wide range of  services they provide, and the importance of Ayurveda and Sinhala medicine as  basic explanatory models of health and illness within the general population may  be significantly under-estimated in analyses of Sri Lanka's medical system. In  practice, Ayurveda is a dynamic phenomenon that offers multifaceted approaches  to healing. These diverse healing formats develop to meet the constantly  changing needs of the society and of illness patterns. This analysis views  illness and health care in terms of the multiple systems of knowledge and  action, phenomena and interaction, that characterize them as well as in terms of  the medical treatises and institutions that formalize them. In this light,  Ayurveda emerges as a plural medical system in itself. As such, it remains a  fundamental means of defining and treating illness in Sri Lanka.","According to 'Exploring pluralism--the many faces of Ayurveda', Ayurveda, a traditional form of medicine, is often seen as just one thing. But in reality, it's a whole bunch of different health practices used by people in Sri Lanka. Because of this, the number of people using Ayurveda and how important it is to their understanding of health and sickness might be underestimated. Ayurveda isn't a static thing - it changes and develops to meet the needs of people and the changing nature of diseases. So, Ayurveda is actually a flexible, multi-faceted healthcare system, and it's a key way that people in Sri Lanka understand and treat illness."
"So, I'm curious about traditional medicines I've heard about, like Ayurveda. Do the sweeteners they use, like honey, actually play a big role in how effective they are?","Traditional medicine systems around the globe, like Unani, Ayurveda and  traditional Chinese medicine, include a number of sugar-based formulations,  which contain a large amount of saccharide-containing sweetener, such as honey,  sucrose or jaggery. With pervasive lifestyle disorders throughout the world,  there have been discussions to consider alternative sweetening agents. Here,  from the perspective of Unani medicine, we discuss how the saccharide-based  sweeteners may be an essential component of these traditional preparations, like  electuaries, which may be deprived of their bioactivities without these  saccharides. With contemporary researches, it is known that apart from their own  therapeutic effects, saccharides also form deep eutectic solvents which help in  enhancing the bioactivity of other ingredients present in crude drugs. In  addition, they provide energy for fermentation which is essential for  biotransformation of compounds. Interestingly, the sugars also increase the  shelf-life of these compound drugs and act as natural preservatives. On the  basis of this review, we strongly believe that saccharide-based sweeteners are  an essential component of traditional medicines and not merely an excipient.","According to 'Why the ""sugars"" in traditional Unani formulations are a pivotal component: A viewpoint perspective', sugars in traditional medicines like those from Unani, Ayurveda, and Chinese systems aren't just there to make the medicine taste better. They actually play a big role in how the medicine works. They help boost the effectiveness of the other ingredients in the medicine and give energy for the necessary chemical changes to happen. They also act like natural preservatives, helping the medicine last longer. So, while we're all trying to cut down on sugar in our diets, it seems when it comes to these traditional medicines, sugar is actually pretty important."
"So, I've heard about this whole Ayurveda thing - can it actually help me stay healthy and are there any cool new discoveries in that field?","Ayurpharmacoepidemiology is a new field developed by synergy of the fields of  clinical pharmacology, epidemiology, and ayurveda. It will use the effects of  ayurvedic medicinal products on large populations to describe and analyze the  practices, evaluate the safety and efficacy, and carry out medicoeconomic  evaluations. Good pharmacoepidemiology practices in ayurveda is projected to  assist with issues of ayurpharmacoepidemiologic research. The embraced good  pharmacoepidemiology practices guideline in this viewpoint will be able to  provide valuable evidence about the health effects of ayurvedic herbs/drugs and  consider different fields like pharmacovigilance, pharmacoeconomics, and drug  discovery with ayurvedic reverse pharmacology approach, also pass out  significant data for further basic sciences study in ayurveda biology,  ayurgenomics, ayurnutrigenomics, and systems biology. Several unanswered  questions about ayurvedic drug use and informed interventions or policies that  can be addressed by informatics database, which will eventually demonstrate the  credibility and rationality of ayurceuticals in the future.","According to 'Ayurpharmacoepidemiology en Route to Safeguarding Safety and Efficacy of Ayurvedic Drugs in Global Outlook', there's a new field combining Ayurveda, drug research, and health studies. They're looking at how Ayurvedic remedies work on a large scale, checking out how safe and effective they are, and even how they can help with money matters in health care. This could help us get more proof on the benefits of Ayurvedic herbs and make strides in areas like drug safety, cost-effectiveness, and new drug discoveries. They're also using tech to answer questions about Ayurvedic drug use and make better health policies. This could make Ayurvedic remedies more credible and logical"
I've heard a lot about ayurveda and its natural remedies. Is it safe to try these along with my regular medications?,"Traditional Indian medicine (ayurveda) is becoming increasingly popular, with  many chronic conditions responding to it well. Most patients begin to take  conventional medications as soon as their diagnoses are made, so ayurvedic  treatments are usually undergone alongside and/or after conventional medical  approaches. A detailed knowledge of the action of food, spices, and medicinal  plants is needed in order to understand their potential influence fully. While  societal use of ayurvedic plants and Indian spices is commonplace, without ill  effect, the use of more concentrated products made from single plants, often in  the form of teas or tablets, is of more concern. The mechanisms by which  polyherbal drugs and their extracts act differ in many respects from the actions  of single substances or synthetic drugs. Despite the fact that ayurvedic  medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their  method of administration, taking into account individuals' needs and their  specific disease conditions.","According to 'The Significance of Ayurvedic Medicinal Plants', Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine approach, is gaining popularity for treating chronic conditions. It's usually used along with or after standard medical treatments. Ayurveda relies heavily on understanding how food, spices, and medicinal plants work. Commonly used Ayurvedic plants and spices are generally safe, but taking concentrated forms like teas or tablets made from a single plant can be a cause for concern. Even though Ayurvedic medicines are natural, their safety still depends on how they're used and the specific needs and conditions of the individual. So, if you're thinking about trying Ayurvedic remedies, make sure they're tailored to your specific needs and always use them wisely."
I'm interested in trying out traditional Chinese medicine. What are some common practices that could help me stay healthy?,"Author information: (1)College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,  Chengdu 611137, China. (2)College of Ethnomedicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,  Chengdu 611137, China.","According to 'A brief introduction of Ayurvedic medical classics', the paper is all about the basics of Ayurvedic medicine. This is an ancient Indian method of healing that uses natural herbs and lifestyle changes to boost your health. So if you're into all-natural and holistic health, you might want to check it out."
"I've heard about this whole Ayurveda thing, can it help me understand why I feel the way I do or why I get sick sometimes?","Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine documented and practised since  1500 B.C., follows a systems approach that has interesting parallels with  contemporary personalized genomic medicine approaches to the understanding and  management of health and disease. It is based on the trisutra, which are the  three aspects of causes, features and therapeutics that are interconnected  through a common organizing principle termed 'tridosha'. Tridosha comprise three  ascertainable physiological entities; vata (kinetic), pitta (metabolic) and  kapha (potential) that are pervasive across systems, work in conjunction with  each other, respond to the external environment and maintain homeostasis. Each  individual is born with a specific proportion of tridosha that are not only  genetically determined but also influenced by the environment during foetal  development. Jointly they determine a person's basic constitution, which is  termed their 'prakriti'. Development and progressi on of different diseases with  their subtypes are thought to depend on the origin and mechanism of perturbation  of the doshas, and the aim of therapeutic practice is to ensure that the doshas  retain their homeostatic state. Similarly, western systems biology epitomized by  translational P4 medicine envisages the integration of multiscalar genetic,  cellular, physiological and environmental networks to predict phenotypic  outcomes of perturbations. In this perspective article, we aim to outline the  shape of a unifying scaffold that may allow the two intellectual traditions to  enhance one another. Specifically, we illustrate how a unique integrative  'Ayurgenomics' approach can be used to integrate the trisutra concept of  Ayurveda with genomics. We observe biochemical and molecular correlates of  prakriti and show how these differ significantly in processes that are linked to  intermediate patho-phenotypes, known to take different course in diseases. We  also observe a significant enr ichment of the highly connected hub genes which  could explain differences in prakriti, focussing on EGLN1, a key oxygen sensor  that differs between prakriti types and is linked to high altitude adaptation.  Integrating our observation with the current literature, we demonstrate how  EGLN1 could qualify as a molecular equivalent of tridosha that can modulate  different phenotypic outcomes, where hypoxia is a cause or a consequence both  during health and diseased states. Our studies affirm that integration of the  trisutra framework through Ayurgenomics can guide the identification of  predisposed groups of individuals and enable discovery of actionable therapeutic  points in an individualized manner.","According to 'Genomic insights into ayurvedic and western approaches to personalized medicine', there's an ancient Indian medical system called Ayurveda, which is pretty similar to the modern personalized medicine we have today. Ayurveda believes in three elements - vata (like movement in your body), pitta (your body's metabolism), and kapha (potential energy). These three elements work together and keep your body balanced. When you were born, you got a unique mix of these three elements, which Ayurveda calls your 'prakriti'. This prakriti is not only determined by your genes, but also by the environment when you were in your mom's belly. 

Now, this prakriti can tell"

I've heard about these whole medical systems mixing traditional and modern practices. Can you tell me more about them and how they might help improve my health?,"Elements of whole medical systems (WMSs) are re-emerging in a modern,  patient-centered care model that leverages the benefits of evidence-based  conventional medical practice with WMSs modalities. Many of these re-emerging  modalities had their origins in traditional Chinese medicine, ayurvedic  medicine, homeopathy, or naturopathy. To date, research has been conducted  predominantly on multimodality treatment of experimental groups, drawing  conclusions without a comparative control group or using modalities that are not  actually WMSs.","According to 'Whole Medical Systems in the Rehabilitation Setting', there's a new trend in healthcare that's combining modern medical practices with traditional healing methods like Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, and naturopathy. The research so far has focused on using multiple treatments at once without comparing them to other groups or using methods that aren't part of these traditional systems. This means we're using old school wisdom with new school methods to hopefully make people feel better."
"I've heard about this Ayurveda stuff, but isn't it really old? Can it actually work together with the regular doctor stuff we have now?","Complementary medicine systems are ascending to rapid popularity as the  twenty-first century progresses. Often adapted from ancient systems of healing  such as Ayurveda, these modern alternative medical movements reappraise  millennia-old health traditions that found their inception at the confluence of  religious philosophy and herbal healing. Naturally, contemporary global economic  forces and a desire to market traditional medicine products in an enticing  fashion have characterised how historic traditional medicine systems are  presented in the modern context. By establishing a vision of complementary  medicine born from ancient traditions, it becomes clear how traditional methods  of healing can contend with Western biomedicine-the prevailing standard of care  around the globe. The claims made by both sides parry along a line of scientific  validity, efficacy and regulatory purview. India, the birthplace of Ayurveda and  an epicentre of contemporary medical education, is a prime arena to study the  friction between biomedicine and traditional medicine. In this piece, I focus on  the modernisation of Ayurveda and how it has found conflict with allopathic  medicine. I posit that Ayurveda has re-emerged since the early twentieth century  as a key tenet of Indian modernity: and in doing so has found contention with  Western medicine. I furthermore argue that despite existing discord, the two  medical traditions are not inherently antithetical. They can be synergistic, so  long as healthcare delivery and education recognise the limits of each and focus  on coaction rather than contradiction.","According to ""Contention and collaboration: the tenuous encounter of modern Ayurveda and Western medicine in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries"", there's a rising interest in alternative medicine systems, like Ayurveda, which has its roots in ancient healing traditions. There's been some tension between these traditional methods and Western medicine, especially in India where Ayurveda originated. But the paper argues that these two types of medicine don't have to be in conflict. They can actually work together to provide better healthcare, as long as we understand the strengths and limitations of each. So, it's like choosing between yoga and gym workouts - they both have their benefits and can actually complement each other when done right."
"So, I'm interested in Ayurveda and all that natural health stuff.

"So, I heard about this thing called human estrus. Can you tell me more about it and how it might affect me?","INTRODUCTION: Human estrus is a new topic to discussion. Articles related to  this are few. AIM: Authors present here the first known report on human estrus, which was  discussed in the Ayurveda classic text, Susruta Samhita, dated back to the 1st  century BC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Supporting this, evidence from modern literature is  presented here. RESULTS: Estrus discussed as a fresh topic. CONCLUSION: Authors concluded that all modern research results, though limited,  are in support of the oldest writing about human estrus.","According to 'Support for human estrus: documentation in Ayurveda', there are some really old texts, like from the 1st century BC, that talk about the human estrus cycle, which is basically a woman's monthly cycle.

It's pretty cool that those folks from way back then knew what they were talking about!"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine. Are there any popular Ayurvedic remedies that I could try out?,"Driven by long-standing ties with India, and intertwined with global market  interests, a growing influx of materia medica from South Asia is currently  emerging in East Africa. To compete at a global level and framed within the  language of 'South-South cooperation for mutual benefit', India presents itself  as an appropriate exporter of medical products suitable for African clientele.  The expansion of India's medical sector into Africa is particularly relevant for  Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals. Ayurveda's diaspora into Africa exemplifies the  emergence of new health interventions and medical assemblages in a  transnationally interconnected world and implies innovative coalitions involved  in the complex promotion of local/Global Health industries. By tracking the flow  of Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals to East Africa, this paper aims to contribute to  the understanding of medical practices as they are configured by the dynamics of  global mobility. It interrogates the extent to which the industrialisation of  Ayurveda occupies a strategic position in Indo-African discursive practices and  the creation of new market opportunities. Moreover, it explores the ways in  which South-South alliances between Indian and African actors produce (new)  solidarities, but also hierarchies and power imbalances. Special attention will  be directed to the political-economic implications of the expansion of  transnational markets.","According to 'From coastal to global: The transnational flow of Ayurveda and its relevance for Indo-African linkages', there's been a big increase in medical products, specifically Ayurvedic ones (that's a traditional Indian system of medicine), being sent from India to East Africa. This is seen as a win-win situation for both sides: India gets to sell more products, and Africa gets access to these medical treatments. The paper looks at how this trade is changing healthcare practices and creating new business opportunities. But it's not all smooth sailing - the study also points out that this exchange isn't exactly equal and can lead to power imbalances. It's a deep dive into the politics and economics of international trade in the medical world."
I've been hearing a lot about wellness and prevention in health care lately. Can you explain what that means and how I can apply it to my own life?,"This article provides global and Indian scenario with strengths and limitations  of present health care system. Affordability, accessibility and availability of  health care coupled with disproportionate growth and double burden of diseases  have become major concerns in India. This article emphasizes need for mindset  change from illness-disease-drug centric curative to person-health-wellness  centric preventive and promotive approaches. It highlights innovation deficit  faced pharmaceutical industry and drugs being withdrawn from market for safety  reasons. Medical pluralism is a growing trend and people are exploring various  options including modern, traditional, complementary and alternative medicine.  In such a situation, knowledge from Ayurveda, yoga, Chinese medicine and  acupuncture may play an important role.

I've got asthma and I'm not really keen on my current meds. Are there any natural remedies or plants that could help me out?,"Asthma is a common disease that is rising in prevalence worldwide with the  highest prevalence in industrialized countries. Asthma affects about 300 million  people worldwide and it has been estimated that a further 100 million will be  affected by 2025. Since the ancient times, plants have been exemplary sources of  medicine. Current asthma therapy lack satisfactory success due to adverse  effect, hence patients are seeking complementary and alternative medicine to  treat their asthma. Ayurveda and other Indian literature mention the use of  plants in various human ailments. India has about 45,000 plant species and among  them several thousand are claimed to possess medicinal properties. Researches  conducted in the last few decades on the plants mentioned in ancient literature  or used traditionally for asthma have shown antiasthmatic, antihistaminic and  antiallergic activity. This review reveals that some plants and their extract  have antiasthmatic, antihistaminic, anticholinergic and antiallergic activity.","According to 'Some medicinal plants with antiasthmatic potential: a current status', asthma is a pretty common problem, especially in highly developed countries. It's predicted that by 2025, even more people will suffer from it. Modern medicine is doing its best, but some people still struggle with side effects. This has led to an increasing interest in alternative treatments, like herbal remedies. India has a ton of plants (around 45,000 species!) and a lot of them have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Recent studies have shown that some of these plants may actually help with asthma symptoms. So maybe it's worth looking into some plant-based therapies if you're having a tough time managing your asthma."
"I've heard about using herbs for health and stuff, but what's this nano-ayurvedic medicine thing? Can it actually help treat serious diseases like cancer?","Nano-ayurvedic medicine is an emerging field in which nanoparticles are  functionalized with active principles of potent ayurvedic herbs to enhance their  efficacy and target-specific delivery. Scientific advances in the past couple of  decades have revealed the molecular mechanisms behind the anticancer potential  of several ayurvedic herbs, attributed chiefly to their secondary metabolites  including polyphenols and other active substances. With the advancement of  nanotechnology, it has been established that size-, shape-, and  surface-chemistry-optimized nanoparticles can be utilized as synergizing  carriers for these phytochemicals. Nano-ayurvedic medicine utilizes herbs that  are commonly used in Ayurveda to functionalize different nanoparticles and  thereby enhance their potency and target specificity. Studies have shown that  the active phytochemicals of such herbs can be coated onto the nanoparticles of  different metals, such as gold, and that they work more efficiently than the  free herbal extract, for example, in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.  Recently, an Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy  (AYUSH)-based clinical trial in humans indicated the anticancer potential of  such formulations. Nano-ayurvedic medicine is emerging as a potential treatment  option for hyperproliferative diseases.","According to 'Nano-ayurvedic medicine and its potential in cancer treatment', scientists are taking the healing properties of certain herbs used in Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine system, and packing them into tiny particles, making them more powerful and better at targeting specific areas in the body. This new field, called nano-ayurvedic medicine, has shown some promise in treating cancer. For example, recent studies have shown that these supercharged particles can slow down the growth of cancer cells better than the herbs on their own. There's even been a clinical trial showing the potential of this approach. In a nutshell, it's like giving a turbo boost to the healing power of these herbs, making them a potential weapon against diseases like cancer."
Who was Todaramalla and what kind of health advice might I find in his works like 'Todarananda'?,"Todaramalla was a famous physician, scholar, statesman, Finance and Revenue  Minister in the court of Akbar.

I'm really interested in Ayurvedic practices. Are there any old books or resources in regional Indian languages that I could find to learn more about it?,"In India many Ayurvĕdic books were written in regional languages like Telugu,  Bengali, Orissa, Gujarati etc. Though some of them are very useful, due to lack  of maintenance and improper protection many of them became extinct and some of  them are on the verge of extinction. Bhişaksudhărnavam is one among such books,  which is on the verge of extinction, details of which are presented here.","According to 'Bhişaksudhărnavam--an unexplored precious Andhrasampradăya Ayurvĕda Grantha', there are many useful books about traditional Indian medicine that were written in local languages like Telugu and Bengali.

"So, what's this ""logagogy"" thing all about and how can it help me live a healthier life?","The meaning of the term ""logagogy"" is elucidated, and logagogic practices are  outlined in the history of medicine. It is shown how the traditional medicine of  India, Ayurveda, shows signs of logagogic practices (sattvavajaya), and that not  only Ayurveda but also the famous Greek physician Galenus emphasize a  philosophical approach to medicine. As Galenus's logagogic practices have their  roots in the tradition of practical philosophy in Greek antiquity, the most  important Greek schools of thought that are relevant to logagogic approaches are  sketched. It is shown that the Stoics created a rationalistic system emphasizing  the importance of the logos for human beings, and that Epicurus made advances in  psychoeducation and cognitive reframing that are important for logagogic  practices. These logagogic approaches of antiquity have been taken up by modern  counseling in philosophical practices. The article closes with an outline of a  clinical logagogy.","According to 'Foundations of clinical logagogy', logagogy is a way of teaching and learning that has been used in the medical field for ages. It's been used in traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, and was even emphasized by the famous Greek doctor, Galenus, showing that it's not new at all. This method of learning gives importance to logical reasoning and reshaping how we think. These old-school techniques are still being used in modern counseling methods. So, it's like using ancient wisdom combined with modern techniques to better understand and learn medicine."

Though his  text on Pathyăpathya has already been published, which has got a place in the  pages of history of Ayurvĕda, a very little is known about this important text  on therapeutics. Various aspects of this text and its author have been discussed  to bring it in to the knowledge of fraternity of Ayurvedic physicians and  Sanskrit scholars.","According to 'Important Ayurvĕda literatures from the manuscripts available from Orissa (Cikitsărnava)', there's a lot of ancient Ayurvedic know-how that's going unnoticed. Many original texts and manuscripts are deteriorating or getting lost. Even though some institutions are trying to salvage and publish these, there's this one particular text from the 16th century called 'Cikitsărnava' that hasn't got much attention. It's got some really cool and unique info about healing and treatment methods that could be super helpful to folks studying Ayurveda and Sanskrit."
I've noticed my grandma struggles with going to the bathroom a lot. Are there any natural treatments that can help with this?,"INTRODUCTION: Neurogenic bladder is a common urological condition among elderly.  It results in incontinence or retention of the urine depending on the synergy of  bladder smooth muscles and urethral sphincter. There can also be a condition  where retention causes overflow incontinence. Retention of urine in this  condition is caused by relative lack of contractility of bladder smooth muscles  in response to the stretch reflex. As a result, there is no urge and therefore  the bladder remains over-distended causing retention of urine. Currently, there  are no absolute ways to deal with such a situation except that the patients are  advised for self-help techniques of regularly evacuating the bladder.  Pharmacotherapy for such condition is not promising. As the patients of  neurogenic bladder are often healthy otherwise (with manageable conditions such  as diabetes), a bladder dysfunction is considered as a disability that they do  not want to share. In this state, any approach that offers a regeneration of  bladder reflex and restoration of its functions is more than one can expect for. METHODS: An elderly male suffering with chronic urinary retention recommended  for indwelling catheterization after the failure of voiding trial following the  possible conventional pharmacotherapy was treated with Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS: There was a complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic  therapy. The changes were stable after 3-month follow-up of the patient. CONCLUSION: This case report presents the complete symptom reversal in a case of  chronic urine retention as an outcome of Ayurvedic therapy. Seeing the  importance of this clinical condition and unavailability of sufficient means in  conventional medicine, it requires a serious note and enquiry into its  applicability in similar cases.","According to ""Low-Pressure, Low-Flow Voiding Dysfunction in an Elderly Male Treated Through Ayurveda: A Case Report"", there's a condition that some older people get where their bladders don't work properly. This can cause them to either not be able to pee when they want to or not be able to hold it in. This can be pretty embarrassing, so they usually don't like to talk about it. Currently, there are no perfect ways to fix this, though some people try to manage it by making sure to empty their bladders regularly. Regular medicine hasn't been super successful in treating this. However, this paper talks about a case where an elderly man with this issue was treated with Ayurveda, a"
I've been having some stomach troubles lately. Could something like mint help balance things out in my gut?,"Gut microbiota includes the microbes present in the gut; these microbes are an  essential component in maintaining a healthy gut. Gut microbiota has a wide  range of functions, including effects on colonization, pathogen resistance,  intestinal epithelial maintenance, metabolizing food and pharmaceutical  chemicals, and influencing immunological functions. Every disease associated  with the gut starts due to a disbalance in the composition of the gut  microorganisms and can be managed by balancing the composition of gut bacteria  using various herbal remedies. Mentha herbs are a variety of perennial herbs  that are grown commercially in various parts of the world. Mentha is a potent  herb that shows anticholinergic action and can block PGE2 and GM1 receptors and  interact with cholera toxins; it is used traditionally in different systems of  medicines to treat various gastrointestinal diseases associated with the gut.  Mentha herbs have potent bactericidal, viricidal, and fungicidal properties.  Mentha has been used to cure stomach and digestion issues as well as to treat a  variety of disorders. This review article summarizes diseases associated with  the gut, the composition, and function of gut microbiota, and mentha's  effectiveness along with its extraction methods and traditional uses. Research  findings revealed that mentha could be an essential source against a wide range  of diseases, especially gastrointestinal disorders. From its ayurvedic claims to  its present use, various confirmed its clinically effective for human health.  The present work also describes the mechanism of action along with the  bioactives present in this well-known herb from Ayurveda.","According to 'Exploring the Role of Mentha in Gut Microbiota: A Modern Perspective of an Ancient Herb', the bacteria in your gut play a huge role in keeping you healthy. If the balance of these bacteria gets messed up, it can lead to stomach issues and other health problems. However, the herb Mentha (you might know it as mint) could be a game changer. It's been used for centuries to treat stomach and digestion problems and has properties that kill harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi. So adding some mint to your diet might not only freshen your breath but also help keep your gut healthy."
I've been hearing about this plant called Tephrosia purpurea in Ayurveda that's supposed to have all sorts of health benefits. Can you tell me more about it?,"Tephrosia purpurea (L.) Pers. is a well-known plant in Ayurveda and named ""Sarwa  wranvishapaka"" for its property to heal wounds. Traditionally, it is practiced  for impotency, asthma, dyspepsia, hemorrhoids, syphilis gonorrhea, rheumatism,  enlargement of kidney and spleen. It is an important component of herbal  preparations like Tephroli and Yakrifti used to cure liver disorders. Various  phytocompounds including pongamol, purpurin, purpurenone, tephrosin, bulnesol,  tephrostachin, β-sitosterol, and so on have been reported. Modern  pharmacological studies have shown that the plant have wound healing,  antileishmanial, anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective,  antifertility, antispermatogenic, anti-diarrheal, diuretic, and insecticidal  properties. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory action reported from this plant aids  its utilization for the development of drugs for Alzheimer's and dementia  neurological disorders. Among the known active compounds of T. purpurea,  tephrostachin is responsible for antiplasmodial activity, tephrosin,  pongaglabol, and semiglabrin exerts antiulcer activity while quercetin, rutin,  β-sitosterol, and lupeol are mainly responsible for its anti-inflammatory and  anti-cancer properties. From different toxicological studies, concentrations up  to 2,000 mg/kg were considered safe. The present review comprehensively  summarizes the ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of T.  purpurea. Further research on elucidation of the structure-function relationship  among active compounds, understanding of multi-target network pharmacology and  clinical applications will intensify its therapeutic potential.","According to 'A comprehensive review on ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity of Tephrosia purpurea (L.)

Modern studies have shown that this plant can help with wound healing, liver protection, and even potentially fight cancer and Alzheimer's. There are lots of different compounds in the plant that make it work, and in certain amounts it seems safe to use. More research is needed to understand exactly how it works and how it could be used in modern medicine."
What's Ayurvedic medicine and how can it help me stay healthy?,"This review focuses on how the study of anatomy in India has evolved through the  centuries. Anatomical knowledge in ancient India was derived principally from  animal sacrifice, chance observations of improperly buried human bodies, and  examinations of patients made by doctors during treatment. The Vedic  philosophies form the basis of the Ayurvedic tradition, which is considered to  be one of the oldest known systems of medicine. Two sets of texts form the  foundation of Ayurvedic medicine, the Susruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita.  The Susruta Samhita provided important surgical and anatomical information of  the understanding of anatomy by Indians in the 6th century BCE. Here we review  the anatomical knowledge known to this society.","According to 'Anatomy in ancient India: a focus on the Susruta Samhita', the study of the human body in India has a long history that dates back centuries. It started with observations from animal sacrifices, finding not properly buried human bodies, and patient examinations by doctors. The Ayurvedic tradition, one of the oldest medical systems, is rooted in the Vedic philosophies. Two important texts, the Susruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita, lay the groundwork for Ayurvedic medicine. The Susruta Samhita, in particular, offered key insights into surgery and the understanding of the human body by Indians around 600 BCE."
I've been thinking about trying out some Ayurvedic supplements. Should I be worried about them messing with my liver?,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine use among Americans is  prevalent. Originating in India, Ayurvedic medicine use in the United States has  grown 57% since 2002. CAM accounts for a significant proportion of drug induced  liver injury in India and China, but there have been only three reports of drug  induced liver injury from Ayurvedic medications in the U.S. We report three  cases of suspected Ayurvedic medication associated liver injury seen at a  Southern California community hospital and review literature of Ayurvedic  medication induced liver injury. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Three patients presented with acute hepatocellular injury  and jaundice after taking Ayurvedic supplements for 90-120 days. First patient  took Giloy Kwath consisting solely of Tinospora cordifolia. Second patient took  Manjishthadi Kwatham and Aragwadhi Kwatham, which contained 52 and 10 individual  plant extracts, respectively. Third patient took Kanchnar Guggulu, containing 10  individual plant extracts. Aminotransferase activities decreased 50% in  < 30 days and all 3 patients made a full recovery. Roussel Uclaf Causality  Assessment Method (RUCAM) scores were 7-8, indicating probable causality. These  products all contained ingredients in other Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese  medicines with previously reported associations with drug induced liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: These patients highlight the risk of drug induced liver injury from  Ayurvedic medications and the complexity of determining causality. There is a  need for a platform like LiverTox.gov to catalog Ayurvedic ingredients causing  liver damage.","According to the 'Case series and review of Ayurvedic medication induced liver injury', taking certain Ayurvedic supplements, which are a type of alternative medicine from India, can potentially harm your liver. The paper talks about three people who had liver problems after using these supplements. It's tricky to say for sure it was the supplements that caused the issues, but the research suggests it's pretty likely. So, it's a good reminder to be careful and do your research when trying new health products, even if they're natural or herbal."

"I've heard about Ayurveda, but I'm not really sure what it is. Could you explain how Ayurvedic drug formulations work and how they might help with my health?","In Ayurvedic therapeutics, drug therapy is given prime importance. There is a  very well developed sub-discipline entirely devoted to drug formulations known  as ""Bhaisajya Kalpanaa"". Considering its importance, different aspects of this  discipline have been presented in this review to familiarize the readers,  especially those who have just started studying Ayurveda, with concept of  ayurvedic pharmaceutics. The Ayurvedic drug formulation is based on what is  known as ""Pancavidha Kasaaya"" concept. According to this concept there are five  basic forms of formulation known as 1-'Swarasa' the expressed juice, 2-'Kalka',  a fine paste obtained by grinding fresh or wet grinding dried plant material 3-  'Kwaatha', the decoction, 4- 'Sheeta' or 'Hima', the cold water infusion and 5-  'Faanta', the hot water infusion. Different aspects of their preparation and use  have been discussed. Further from the above basic forms, a number of other  formulations are derived; a brief description of each of them has been given  along with brief outlines of drug formulations meant for specific routes. The  third part of the review is devoted to discussion of influence of different  factors on the expression of pharmacological activity.","According to 'Bhaishajya Kalpanaa - the Ayurvedic pharmaceutics - an overview', Ayurvedic medicine, a traditional Indian practice, uses a unique system called ""Bhaisajya Kalpanaa"" to create drug formulations.

(Amalaki or the Indian gooseberry, Family: Euphorbiaceae) is considered  to be a universal panacea in the traditional Indian system of medicine the  Ayurveda. It has been described in the Ayurveda text as a ""Rasayana' and to  rejuvenat the debilitated organs. Ayurvedic physicians use Triphala for many  ailments but most importantly to treat various gastrointestinal disorders.  Scientific studies carried out in the past two decades have validated many of  the ethnomedicinal claims and researches have shown Triphala to possess free  radical scavenging, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic,  antibacterial, antimutagenic, wound healing, anticariogenic, antistress,  adaptogenic, hypoglycaemic, anticancer, chemoprotective, radioprotective and  chemopreventive effects. Clinical studies have also shown that Triphala was  found to have good laxative property, to improve appetite and reduce gastric  hyperacidity. Studies have also shown that Triphala was effective in preventing  dental caries and that this effect was equal to that of chlorhexidine. The  current review addresses the validated pharmacological properties of Triphala  and also emphasizes on aspects that need further investigation for its future  clinic application.","According to 'Scientific validation of the ethnomedicinal properties of the Ayurvedic drug Triphala: a review', Triphala, a natural blend of three fruits used in traditional Indian medicine, is pretty awesome for your health.

"I've heard about Ayurveda before, but I'm not sure what it really is. Can you explain the basics and how it might help me stay healthy?","In the prebiblical Ayurvedic origins, every creation inclusive of a human being  is a model of the universe. In this model, the basic matter and the dynamic  forces (Dosha) of the nature determine health and disease, and the medicinal  value of any substance (plant and mineral). The Ayurvedic practices (chiefly  that of diet, life style, and the Panchkarama) aim to maintain the Dosha  equilibrium. Despite a holistic approach aimed to cure disease, therapy is  customized to the individual's constitution (Prakruti). Numerous Ayurvedic  medicines (plant derived in particular) have been tested for their biological  (especially immunomodulation) and clinical potential using modern  ethnovalidation, and thereby setting an interface with modern medicine. To  understand Ayurvedic medicine, it would be necessary to first understand the  origin, basic concept and principles of Ayurveda.","According to 'Ayurvedic Medicine: Core Concept, Therapeutic Principles, and Current Relevance', Ayurveda, an ancient health practice from India, believes that all things, including people, are part of the universe. Our health is determined by natural forces, called Dosha, and the balance of these forces in our bodies. Ayurveda uses diet, lifestyle changes, and therapies to maintain this balance. What's cool about Ayurveda is that it customizes treatment to each person's unique body type or constitution. Modern science is now studying Ayurvedic plant-based medicines for their potential health benefits. So to really get Ayurveda, we need to understand its roots, its main ideas, and its principles."
I've heard about this plant called Swertia chirata used in traditional medicine. Can it really help with things like heart issues or even cancer?,"Swertia chirata is a plant with bitter taste used since an early date in  traditional medical systems of our country for treatment of varied human  ailments. In Ayurveda, the plant is used as stomachic, febrifuge,  antihelminthic, diuretic as well as for treatment of some types of mental  disorders. Experimental revalidation of the medicinal properties of this plant  along with chemical analysis of its constituents have generated interest in the  medicinal value of Swertia chirata and is likely to open up new avenues for its  multispectrum use. In view of the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and  anticarcinogenic activities reported in recent times, the plant demands a more  detailed probe to determine its use in pharmaceutical industry for preparation  of drugs for prevention and treatment of chronic human diseases like diabetes,  cardiac problems and cancer. The aim of the present review is to draw attention  of researchers in biomedical sciences and pharmaceuticals to this very important  plant which has so far not received its due recognition.","According to 'Highlighting the anti-carcinogenic potential of an ayurvedic medicinal plant, Swertia Chirata', this bitter tasting plant has been used in traditional medicine for ages to treat various health problems. Think of it as nature's multi-tool for health. It's used for things like helping with stomach issues, reducing fever, flushing out toxins from your body, and even treating some mental health issues. Recent studies show that it may also have potential in preventing and treating serious diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. So, it's like this underdog plant that hasn't been fully recognized for its health benefits yet. Researchers are encouraged to study it more, especially in the field of medicine and drug creation."
I've been feeling super stressed and my memory is just not what it used to be. Are there any natural remedies or herbs I could try to help with that?,"Ayurveda is the oldest system of Medicine in the world, its antiquity going back  to the Vedas.

The areas of special consideration in Ayurveda are  geriatrics, rejuvenation, nutrition, immunology, genetics and higher  consciousness. The Ayurvedic texts describe a set of rejuvenative measures to  impart biological sustenance to the bodily tissues. These remedies are called  Rasayana which are claimed to act as micronutrients. Some of these Rasayanas are  organ and tissue specific. Those specific to brain tissue are called Medhya  Rasayana. Such Rasayanas retard brain aging and help in regeneration of neural  tissues besides producing antistress, adaptogenic and memory enhancing effect.  In addition to the long tradition of textual and experience-based evidence for  their efficacy, certain recent studies conducted on these traditional remedies  on scientific parameters have shown promising results which have been reviewed  in this paper for providing lead for further studies.

I've got this chronic nerve pain that's really bugging me. Are there any natural remedies or plants that could help me out?,"Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic pain state accompanied by tissue injury  and nerve damage. This important health issue constitutes a challenge for the  modern medicine worldwide. The management of neuropathic pain remains a major  clinical challenge, pertaining to an inadequate understanding of  pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain. Various classes of drugs have  been reported effective for the management of neuropathic pain viz. opiates,  tricyclic antidepressants, and antiepileptic agents. However, association of  adverse effects with these drugs hinders their confident prescription in people  with neuropathic pain. Recently, various medicinal plants have been reported  effective for the management of neuropathic pain. So, it may be prudent to look  beyond synthetic drugs pertaining to their unprecedented pharmacotherapeutic  effects with lesser adverse effects. The extensive literature review has been  carried out from databases such as Science direct, Scifinder, Wiley online  library, PubMed, Research gate, Google scholar and Chemical Abstracts. The list  of Traditional Indian Medicinal plants (TIMPs) and isolated compounds have been  compiled which have been reported effective as an alternative therapy for the  management of neuropathic pain. This helps the researchers to discover some  novel therapeutic agents against neuropathic pain.","According to 'Alternative treatment strategies for neuropathic pain: Role of Indian medicinal plants and compounds of plant origin-A review', chronic pain related to nerve damage can be really tough to treat effectively. Traditional painkillers, antidepressants, and anti-seizure meds can work, but they sometimes have side effects that make them a bit of a gamble. But the latest research is pretty exciting because it's showing that certain medicinal plants, especially some that are used in traditional Indian medicine, might be a good alternative. These plants seem to help with the pain and don't have as many side effects, which could be a big win for people dealing with this kind of chronic pain."
"I've been having some stomach issues lately. Are there any natural remedies, like herbs or plants, that could help soothe my tummy?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aucklandia costus Falc. a medicinal plant is  native to the Himalayan region and synonymous with Saussurea costus, Saussurea  lappa, and Aucklandia lappa. It has an ancient background of being used  ethnopharmacologically for various body ailments. According to Ayurveda, Unani,  Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Costus roots are recommended for  leukoderma, liver, kidney, blood disorders, Qi stagnation, and tridosha. Root  and powder are used orally with warm water to cure gastric problems, and the  paste is applied to the inflamed area to relieve pain. Root paste is applied on  the skin to cure boils, blisters, and leprosy. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present review is to establish a correlation  among the ethnopharmacological uses and scientific studies conducted on A.  costus with chemical constituents, safety & toxicity data including future  directions for its conservation with higher yield and effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted by studying books, research  papers, and literature in history, agroforestry, phytopharmacology of Himalayan  plants using international databases, publication, Red data book, and reports.  The search engines: Pubmed, Scopus, Wiley Inter-science, Indian Materia Medica,  Science Direct, and referred journals are referenced. RESULTS: The literature collected from databases, journals, websites, and books  mentioned the use of costus roots in local and traditional practices. CITES  included A. costus in a critically endangered category due to lack of cultural  practices and overexploitation from wild. A. costus roots are known since 13th  century for use in ancient Ayurvedic products but the scientific evaluation is  of future research interest. A correlation of traditional uses with scientific  studies has been explored to assess the effect of root powder, extract, oil and  isolated constituents: Costunolids, Saussureamine B and Dehydrocostus lactone  etc. in gastric ulceration and lesions; inhibition of antigen-induced  degranulation, mucin production, number of immune cells, eosinophils, and  expression and secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in asthma. The  inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators is also reported by Cynaropicrin,  Alantolactone, Caryophyllene, Costic acid. Also, the sesquiterpene lactones has  profound effect in inhibition of inflammatory stages and induced apoptotic  cascades in cancer. Very few data on the safety and toxicity of plant parts have  been noted which needs to be evaluated scientifically. CONCLUSION: A. costus have been noted to have remarkable effect for gastric,  hepatic, inflammatory, respiratory, cancer, skin problems but there were several  errors in selection of plant material, authentification, selection of dose,  assessment, selection of standard and control have been identified. Therefore, a  schematic drug development and research strategy exploiting the potential of  plant extract, fraction, products and probable constituents, costunolide,  dehydrocostus lactone, cynaropicrin, saussureamine assuring dose-response  relationship and safety may be determined under pre-clinical which may be  extrapolated to clinical level.

I've been having some health issues that my doctor can't seem to figure out. Could astrology help me understand what's going on?,"Astrology is the art of predicting or determining the influence of the planets  and stars on human affairs. The origin of this word is from Greek word astron,  star + logos (discourse). Both Ayurveda and Astrology have established a way of  life in India since time immemorial. Highly advanced knowledge related to  Astrology on medicine is preserved in Indian Holy scriptures and transmitted  from generation to generation. Although both Astrology and medicine were  developed as a part of religion in ancient India, astrological principles  related to prevention, health care and relief from illness were applied as  rituals (religious ceremonies). An astrologer gives guidance for taking  medicines at suitable time for the best remedy of ailments. Even the medicinal  herbs were collected and used at appropriate times for their efficacy. Astrology  and Ayurveda are inseparable in human life. Role of the Astrology in healthy  life and pathogenesis of the disease is well known to Indians. When a physician  knows etiology of the disease, he attempts to treat the disease with specific  medication, diet and life style and also avoiding causative factors. In a case  where a physician is unable to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to  treat, the patient depends upon Astrology. Account of good and bad deeds during  this life and previous lives, their consequences of health or ill health during  this life which orderly, when, what and how will be clearly known through  Astrology.

What's this Astangahrdayasamhita thing all about? Is it like an old-school guide to staying healthy?,"Astangahrdayasamhita, transmitted into the region of Tibet and Mongolia as  Buddist Scripture, is a classical work of ancient Indian medicine. It has had an  important influence on the formation of the theoretical system of Tibetan  medicine and Mongolian medicine. Divided into six parts, eight branches and 120  chapters, Astangahrdayasamhita describes systematically physiology, pathology,  diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This article describes Astangahrdayasamhita  in four aspects, including the author and dating of its writing: the main  contents; its position in Ayur-vedic medicine; the influence on Tibetan and  Mongolian medicine.","According to 'Preliminary research of Astangahrdayasamhita', this old Indian medical book that made its way to Tibet and Mongolia has had a big influence on how they practice medicine there. The book is really detailed, covering everything from how the body works, to how to figure out what's wrong when you're sick, and how to treat those illnesses. It's a pretty big deal in the world of Ayurvedic medicine (that's a traditional Indian way of healing), and it's had a big ripple effect on Tibetan and Mongolian medicine too."
Is it tough to become a certified Ayurvedic practitioner in the US?,"The following is a transcript of a talk given by Wynn Werner, who is a board  member of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association (NAMA) and member of the  NAMA standards committee, at the NAMA conference in April 2010. In this talk,  Werner discusses the legal and licensing challenges facing Ayurvedic  practitioners in the United States. IAYT finds the work of NAMA on the issue of  professional development to be both educational and thought-provoking for our  own field's parallel process.

I've been seeing a psychiatrist for a while but I'm not sure it's helping. Are there doctors who mix Western medicine with traditional Indian practices?,"Medical anthropologists have not paid enough attention to the variation at the  level of the individual practitioners of biomedicine, and anthropological  critiques of biomedical psychiatry as it is practiced in settings outside the  Global North have tended to depict psychiatrists in monolithic terms. In this  article, we attempt to demonstrate that, at least in the case of India, some  psychiatrists perceive limitations in the biomedical model and the cultural  assumptions behind biomedical practices and ideologies. This paper focuses on  three practitioners who supplement their own practices with local and  alternative healing modalities derived from South Asian psychologies,  philosophies, systems of medicine and religious and ritual practices. The  diverging psychiatric practices in this paper represent a rough continuum. They  range from a bold and confident psychiatrist who uses various techniques  including ritual healing to another who yearns to incorporate more Indian  philosophy and psychology in psychiatric practice and encourages students of  ayurvedic medicine to more fully embrace the science they are learning to a less  proactive psychiatrist who does not describe a desire to change his practice but  who is respectful and accepting of ayurvedic treatments that some patients also  undergo. Rather than simply applying a hegemonic biomedical psychiatry, these  psychiatrists offer the possibility of a more locally-attuned, context sensitive  psychiatric practice.","According to 'Curiosity and Creative Experimentation Among Psychiatrists in India', some psychiatrists in India are mixing it up and doing things a little differently. Instead of just using traditional Western medical practices, they're incorporating elements of Indian culture, philosophies, and even religious rituals into their treatment methods. This ranges from one psychiatrist who's really confident and uses a whole bunch of different techniques including ritual healing, to another who's encouraging students to dig deeper into the science of Ayurvedic medicine. There's also one who's not really changing his own methods but is cool with his patients using Ayurvedic treatments. Basically, these doctors are trying to make their practice fit better with the local culture and context."
How did mental health treatments change in India during the 19th century? Was there a difference in how they treated mental illness compared to Western countries?,"The article documents medical approaches to mental illness in mid- to  late-nineteenth-century India through examining the Indian Medical Gazette and  other medical accounts. By the late nineteenth century, psychiatry in Europe  moved from discussions around asylum-based care to a nuanced and informed debate  about the nature of mental symptoms. This included ideas on phrenology and  craniometry, biological and psycho-social causes, physical and drug treatments,  many of which travelled to India. Simultaneously, indigenous socio-medical ideas  were being debated. From the early to the mid-nineteenth century, not much  distinction was made between the Western and the native 'mind', and consequently  the diagnosis and investigation of mental symptoms did not differ. However, by  the late nineteenth century Western medicine considered the 'Western mind' as  more civilized and sophisticated than the 'native mind.","According to 'Psychological symptoms and medical responses in nineteenth-century India', back in the 1800s in India, people began looking at mental health differently. They used to think that the minds of people from the West and from India were pretty much the same, so they treated mental health issues in the same way. But towards the end of the 19th century, Western doctors started to think that the 'Western mind' was more advanced than the 'native mind'. They also started exploring different causes and treatments for mental illness, including physical treatments and medications. These ideas also made their way to India. At the same time, there was a lot of debate about traditional Indian ideas about health and medicine."
I've heard a lot about herbal medicines lately. Are they a safer alternative to regular drugs and where can I learn more about them?,"Pharmaceutical is one of the allied branches of science, which is closely  associated with Medical science. Today pharmaceutical chemistry and  pharmacognosy are playing important role in treatment for a disease and its  prevention. Herbal medicines are being used by about 80% of the world population  mostly in the developing countries in the primary health care. There has been an  upsurge in demand for the Phyto-pharmaceutical products of Ayurvĕda in western  nations, because of the fact that the synthetic drugs are considered to be  unsafe. Due to this many national and multinational pharmaceutical companies are  now concentrating on manufacturing of Ayurvĕdic Phyto-pharmaceutical products.  Ayurvĕda is the Indian traditional system of medicine, which also deals about  pharmaceutical science. The Ayurvĕdic knowledge of the pharmaceutical science is  scattered in Ayurvĕdic classical texts. Săranghadhara Samhita, which is written  by Săranghadhara, explain systematically about the information of the Ayurvĕdic  pharmaceutical science and also updated it. Industrialized manufacturing of  Ayurvĕdic dosage forms has brought in new challenges like deviation from basic  concepts of medicine preparation. Săranghadhara Samrhită the devout text on  pharmaceutics in Ayurvĕda comes handy to solve such problems, as the methods  described are very lucid and easy to follow.","According to 'Basic principles of pharmaceutical science in Ayurvĕda', medicine isn't just about pills made in a lab. A lot of people, especially in developing countries, use herbal medicines for healthcare. Nowadays, even in western countries, people are starting to prefer these herbal or plant-based medicines, known as Phyto-pharmaceutical products. The reason is simple - they're viewed as safer than synthetic drugs. This trend has led many big pharmaceutical companies to start making these herbal medicines too. One of the guides they use is from an old Indian system of medicine called Ayurvĕda, which has a lot of knowledge on how to make these medicines. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, which helps in making these medicines correctly"
"I've heard a lot about Ayurvedic medicine recently, but with all the talk about fake or adulterated products, how can I be sure I'm getting the real stuff?","The present market for herbal drugs is estimated about ₹40 billion, which is  expected to increase by 16% in next 3-4 years. The current production of many  Ayurvedic herbs is less than their market demand, which incentivizes  adulteration in the Ayurvedic drug supply chain. The present work aims to  highlight the most used Ayurvedic plants that have been listed in the  International Union for Conservation of Nature's ""red list"" of endangered or  vulnerable plants. The future of Ayurvedic medicines from these listed plants is  uncertain, as the collection of herbs from their natural habitat is prohibited  and their cultivation does not meet market demands. Many of these plants, such  as Taxus baccata and T. wallichiana, are endangered and are only grown in their  natural habitats; their cultivation in other areas is impractical. This is the  present state, and will worsen as demand continues to grow, with increasing  populations and increasing adoption of this system of medicine. It is possible  that in coming years most of the Ayurvedic drugs will be adulterated, and will  cause only side effects rather than the therapeutic effects. The Ayurvedic  fundamentals are under-explored areas where the Ayurvedic practitioners and  research scientists can work together. The scientific work on the basic  principles will unravel many unknown or little-known facts of this ancient  science. Hence, the present review emphasizes the conservation of Ayurvedic  herbs, minimization of the use of medicinal plants and the promotion of the  research based on Ayurvedic fundamentals.","According to 'Status of Indian medicinal plants in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the future of Ayurvedic drugs: Shouldn't think about Ayurvedic fundamentals?', there's a growing market for herbal drugs, but we're facing a problem. Some of the plants used in Ayurvedic medicine are endangered or threatened, making it difficult to get enough of them to meet demand. This could lead to fake or harmful versions of these drugs being sold. The paper suggests that it's important to focus on protecting these plants and also on researching more into Ayurveda to uncover new facts about this ancient practice. So, the next time you buy Ayurvedic products, remember this and make sure what you're buying is legit."
I've heard a bit about energy medicine and stuff like Ayurveda. Can these alternative methods really help improve my health?,"Critical phenomena offer an attractive new theoretical resource for biophysics.  Physical instabilities result in fluctuations, the quantum properties of which  can be applied to regulatory control mechanisms in living organisms with  promising results. Many aspects of energy medicine can be scientifically  modeled, in agreement with previous theoretical ideas and speculation, such as  the existence of macroscopic quantum coherence in living systems. Light is shed  on areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as Ayurveda,  naturopathy, and the nature and action of potentized medicines in homeopathy and  other aspects of vibrational medicine.","According to 'Are we close to a theory of energy medicine?', there's some exciting research happening that looks at how our bodies might use natural energy and vibrations for healing. This could include stuff like using light or certain natural therapies to help our bodies stay healthy or recover from illness. Scientists are even looking at how these methods could be used in combination with more traditional medicines for better results. So, who knows? Maybe in the future, your doctor might recommend a dose of sunlight along with your antibiotics."
Why isn't Yoga & Naturopathy included in the new health regulations like the other traditional Indian medical systems?,"The combined discipline of Yoga & Naturopathy (Y&N) constitutes one of the  official indigenous medical systems under the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga &  Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), Government of  India (GoI). The GoI has recently regulated all the systems under AYUSH, except  Yoga & Naturopathy, through the National Commission for Indian System of  Medicine (NCISM) Bill, 2020 [1]. However, Y&N has been left out from the NCISM  Bill, despite the recommendations of the Department-related Parliamentary  Standing Committee on the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine  Bill, 2019 [2: p 20], and NITI Aayog [3: p 15]. On the contrary, GoI has  proposed a board for regulating Y&N without defining its statutory value or  timeline.","According to 'Is delayed regulation of yoga and naturopathic medicine in India breeding quackery?', the Indian government has set up rules for a lot of traditional medicinal practices. But they haven't done the same for Yoga and Naturopathy yet, even though some big groups reckon they should. Instead, the government is thinking of making a special board to oversee Yoga and Naturopathy, but they haven't given any details on what that would involve or when it might happen."
So I heard about this thing called Siddha medicine from India. Why did it become popular all of a sudden in the 1920s?,"This essay aims to situate the emergence of Siddha medicine as a separate  medical system in the erstwhile Madras Presidency of colonial India within a  broader socio-economic context. Scholars who have worked on Siddha medicine have  stressed more on political dimensions like nationalism and sub-nationalism with  inadequate attention to the interplay of various (other) factors including  contemporary global developments, changes in the attitude of the colonial State  and especially to the new promises held by the greater deference shown to  indigenous medical systems from the 1920s. If the construction of 'national  medicine' based on the Sanskrit texts and the accompanying marginalisation of  regional texts and practices were the only reasons for the emergence of Siddha  medicine as presented by scholars, it leaves open the question as to why this  emergence happened only during the third decade of the twentieth century, though  the marginalisation processes started during the first decade itself. This paper  seeks to find an answer by analysing the formation of Siddha medical identity  beyond the frameworks of nationalism and sub-nationalism. Further, it explicates  how material factors served as immediate cause along with the other, and more  ideational factors related to the rise of the Dravidian political and cultural  movement.","According to 'Rise of Siddha medicine: causes and constructions in the Madras Presidency (1920-1930s)', Siddha medicine, a traditional Indian method of healing, didn't just pop up out of nowhere because people wanted to rebel against mainstream medicine. There were plenty of other things going on at the same time that helped it become a thing. This includes stuff like what was happening around the world, how the government felt about it, and the growing respect for native healing methods. The paper tries to figure out why Siddha medicine really took off in the 1920s, even though it had been around and used locally for a while. It also discusses how the rise of a specific political and cultural movement in the region played"
I've heard Ayurvedic medicine is more about staying fit than just treating illnesses. Can you explain how that works?,"Because most scholars take it for granted that medicine is concerned with  healing and problems of ill health, the way in which various medical systems  define good health has not been adequately studied. Moreover, good health as  such is usually regarded as a natural, normative state of being even by most  medical anthropologists, who otherwise take a critical, relativist perspective  on the subject of illness, pain, and disease. Using the case of Ayurvedic  medicine, this article shows that there is a very different way of looking at  the question of how health is embodied. This perspective is proactive and  concerned with overall fitness rather than reactive and primarily concerned with  either illness or disease. The argument presented here therefore seeks to go  beyond the limiting--although extremely useful--orientation of remedial health  care and suggest a radical challenge to some of the most basic ontological  assumptions in the cross-cultural comparative study of medical systems.","According to 'Heaps of health, metaphysical fitness: Ayurveda and the ontology of good health in medical anthropology,' the way we see good health isn't always the same across different cultures and medical systems. The article discusses Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian practice, which focuses more on keeping the body in good shape and fit, rather than only treating illnesses when they occur. This is different from how we typically see health, where we wait until we're sick to get treated. So, it's like keeping your car well-maintained and regularly serviced, instead of waiting for it to break down to fix it."
"What's this Unani medicine I keep hearing about, and how is its quality and safety regulated in India?","Compliance with pharmacopeial standards is mandatory to ensure the quality,  safety, and efficacy of medicines. In India, allopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani,  and homeopathy are the recognized systems of medicine and come under the  provisions of different regulations. Promulgation of the ""Drugs and Cosmetics  Act, 1940"" and the rules thereunder provide a regulatory framework for medicines  of all of these systems and also prescribe ""Pharmacopoeia and Formularies"" for  regulatory quality standards. Unlike in many other countries, the Act prescribes  independent pharmacopeias for each system of medicine. The Unani Pharmacopoeia  of India (UPI) and the National Formulary of Unani Medicine are the regulatory  compendia for quality standards and manufacturing of Unani medicines,  respectively. The Pharmacopoeia consists of Part I (single drugs) and Part II  (formulations). Unani medicines are presented as classical or patent and  proprietary formulations prepared using single ingredients or multiple  ingredients of plant, animal, mineral, and/or metal origin. UPI Part I is  published in six volumes comprising 298 monographs on Unani drugs derived from  plants (single drugs). Part II is published in three volumes encompassing  formulations, standard operating procedures, and quality standards for 150  classical formulations of Unani medicines, which are chosen from the National  Formularies of Unani Medicine. The National Formulary of Unani Medicine is  published in six parts comprising 1229 formulations of Unani medicines. Each  monograph of the Pharmacopoeia provides specific analytical parameters and  limits (standards) to ensure the quality of drugs or medicines. This  communication reviews the UPI, the National Formulary of Unani Medicine,  regulatory quality standards (parameters), and analytical techniques adopted for  pharmacopeial standards of Unani drugs and medicines.","According to 'Regulatory Requirements for Quality Control of Unani Medicines', it's super important that medicines, including those from different types of medical systems, meet certain quality and safety standards. In India, they have separate guidelines for each type of medicine, including Unani medicine, which is made from plants, animals, minerals, and metals. These guidelines, called the Unani Pharmacopoeia of India and the National Formulary of Unani Medicine, are like recipe books that detail how to make these medicines and ensure they're up to snuff. They even have specific tests to make sure the quality of these medicines is top-notch."
I'm really into the idea of staying young and healthy for as long as possible. Is there any natural therapy or lifestyle changes I can make to help with that?,"Ayurveda is a science of life, therefore it is the science, by the knowledge of  which life may be prolonged. It is human nature to aspire for longevity and this  desire is found practically among all the peoples of the world. Accordingly if  longevity is desired, there must be a system of rejuvenation for one who keeps  on remaining young. Rasayana therapy has been described for this person in  Ayurveda as a systematic and scientific medical discipline and great results  were claimed by this therapy. Hence the Rasayana therapy has been reviewed in  the various headings giving its uses, definition, types and formulations etc.","According to 'Rasayana therapy in classical literature of Ayurveda: a review', Ayurveda, an ancient healing system, believes in a treatment called Rasayana therapy that helps you stay young and live longer. So if you're looking to keep that youthful glow and energy, this could be something to look into."
I've heard Ayurvedic medicine can help with brain health. Are there any specific herbs I should be looking into?,"Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine that is indigenous to India, is believed  to be the world's oldest comprehensive health-care system and is now one of the  most recognized and widely practiced disciplines of alternative medicine in the  world. Medicinal herbs have been in use for treating diseases since ancient  times in India. Ayurvedic therapies with medicinal herbs and herbomineral  products generally provide relief without much adverse effects even after  prolonged administration. Neurodegenerative disorders are a major cause of  mortality and disability, and increasing life spans represent one of the key  challenges of medical research. Ayurvedic medicine describes most  neurodegenerative diseases and has defined a number of plants with therapeutic  benefits for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases having antioxidant  activities. In this chapter, the role of four important Ayurvedic medicinal  plants, viz., Withania somnifera (ashwagandha), Bacopa monnieri (brahmi),  Centella asiatica (gotu kola), and Mucuna pruriens (velvet bean), on  neurodegenerative diseases are discussed.","According to 'Indian Herbs for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disease', Ayurveda, which is an ancient medical system from India, uses a lot of medicinal herbs for treating diseases. It's now a popular alternative medicine practice all over the world. This study focuses on how four Ayurvedic plants can help with neurodegenerative diseases - these are conditions that cause your brain and nerves to deteriorate over time. The plants are ashwagandha, brahmi, gotu kola, and velvet bean. They can provide relief and have antioxidant effects, which are good for your body. So, if you're into herbal remedies, these might be worth looking into!"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda. Are there any natural remedies or daily habits recommended in it that could help boost my energy levels?,"Vastuguna Dipika is a Nighantu Grantha written in Telugu language on Ayurvĕda  drugs, diets and deeds in an alphabetical order in Telugu language and it is a  much popular book for more than a century.

I've been having these weird symptoms that my doctor can't explain. Could it be something psychological and can alternative therapies like Ayurveda help me out?,"OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting with functional neurological symptoms like  non-epileptic seizures and weakness have an underlying psychological component  and tend to persist for a prolonged time, despite repeated evaluations and  interventions. Ayurveda, with its holistic approach to health and disease, can  provide better management for such disorders, in the form of customized  treatment protocols and unique methods of psychotherapy. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with drooping of both eyelids,  initially diagnosed as ocular myasthenia, and later found to have psychogenic  pseudo-myasthenic ptosis. She was evaluated based on ayurvedic parameters and  managed successfully with ayurvedic treatment modalities of sodhana (dosha  elimination), samana (pacifying), and a novel psychotherapy technique of Smriti  meditation. CONCLUSIONS: A holistic approach to the patient, as expounded by Ayurveda, is  vital in evaluating and managing functional neurological complaints. Smriti  meditation, in combination with selected ayurvedic medicines, is effective in  managing psychosomatic manifestations as demonstrated in the present case.","According to 'Psychogenic pseudo-myasthenic ptosis - management with ayurvedic medicines and Smriti meditation', some health issues like non-epileptic seizures or weakness can have underlying psychological causes that traditional treatments can't always fix.

My baby brother has cradle cap and it looks really bad. Are there any natural remedies from traditional medicine that can help?,"Siddha medicine is one of the oldest (5000 years old) well-documented Indian  traditional medicines, compared with Ayurveda, Unani, and traditional Chinese  medicine, by way of keen observation and experimentation. It mentions 108  diseases that occur in childhood, which are further classified and described  into various subtypes based on the clinical features and different stages of a  particular disease. The authors translate the elegant and detailed description  of one neonatal disorder, infantile seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap), called  kabaala kuttam (KK), described in 17 stanzas of four lines for each stanza from  Tamil language script into English. There are five different types of cradle  cap, including white type, dark black type, red type, weeping type, and toxic  type. Four polyherbal formulations are described for external and oral  administration, in which there is mention of 39 herbals and pure sulfur as  ingredients. The safety and efficacy of these herbal products varies and has not  been fully explored in infants, but may represent options for clinical  development.","According to 'Infantile seborrheic dermatitis: a pediatric Siddha medicine treatise', Siddha medicine is an old school Indian medical practice that's been around for 5,000 years. It identifies 108 different childhood diseases, and this paper focuses on one in particular called cradle cap, or kabaala kuttam in Tamil. It's a newborn skin condition that comes in five different types: white, dark black, red, weeping, and toxic. The paper talks about four different herbal treatments that include a mix of 39 different herbs and some pure sulfur. The safety and effectiveness of these treatments for babies haven't been fully tested yet, but they could potentially be developed into new treatments."
"So Ayurveda is all about personalized medicine, right? Can it be tested in a way that aligns with modern science, and would it help me if I'm looking for a more natural approach to health?","Despite its ancient roots and prominence in India as an accepted alternative to  modern medicine, Ayurveda's growth has been hampered by an inability to carry  out clinical studies of its effectiveness and safety using modern scientific  methods - while preserving the core of Ayurveda, which is personalised medicine.  In this comment, we propose that the N-of-1 trial be used as a practical method  to evaluate Ayurvedic treatments, which is simultaneously consistent with the  canons of modern medicine and of Ayurveda. We emphasise the importance of doing  this as a practical alternative that will benefit patients. We need not wait to  resolve the epistemic inconsistency between Ayurveda and modern medicine to take  steps in this direction.","According to 'Scientific evaluation of Ayurvedic drugs - the use of N-of-1 clinical trials', Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine, hasn't been able to grow as much because it's been tough to test its effectiveness and safety using modern science methods. However, they suggest that the N-of-1 trial could be a useful way to evaluate Ayurvedic treatments. This type of trial would keep the personalized nature of Ayurveda and would also be accepted in modern medicine. The idea is that we don't have to wait for Ayurveda and modern medicine to fully align in order to start exploring these options."
I've heard about Ayurveda recently. What's its history and how did it become popular in Hyderabad?,"Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur, the Nizam VII ruled the Hyderabad State for about 38  years. In those days Ayurveda was flourishing in the state due to efforts of  many Ayurvedic physicians, scholastic teachers, distinguished patrons and  well-wishes who worked together with devotional spirit to make Ayurveda  available to the people of the state to provide care for the diseases. Nizam  Ayurveda Vaidya Sangh started Nizam Ayurvedic college and Nizam Ayurvedic Sadar  Dawakhana in Hyderabad city under their management in the year 1934 as a private  institution, which was inaugurated in the same year by Azam Jah Bahadur, the  Prince of Berar. Consequent upon the inauguration, the Nizam Government accorded  sanction of an amount of Rs. 200/- per month for Ayurveda. Thus the seed of  Ayurveda was sown during the reign of Nizam VII in the Hyderabad state.","According to 'Dawn of Ayurveda during the reign of Nizam VII of Hyderabad', a guy named Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur, who was a big shot in Hyderabad, really helped Ayurveda, which is like this super old health and wellness system, thrive during his rule. He and a bunch of other people passionate about Ayurveda, started a college and a healthcare center back in 1934. Even the government was supportive and funded it. So basically, this time was a major game-changer for Ayurveda in Hyderabad."
Did ancient Indian monks have any cool health routines or habits I could try for better overall wellness?,"BACKGROUND: The famous Tang Dynasty monk Yi Jing travelled to ancient India in  671 AD, visited more than 30 regions and returned to China in 695 AD. He wrote  Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan, which he completed in 691 AD. It describes the basic  rules, namely 'Inner Dharma' (Neifa,) that Buddhist sites and monks should  follow in their daily lives. Additionally, the author provided an overview of  ancient Indian Buddhist medicine, covering aetiology, diagnosis, medication,  acupuncture, health preservation and other aspects, which exhibited distinct  characteristics. METHODS: This article first delves into the original text of Nanhai Jigui Neifa  Zhuan by reading it thoroughly and extracts core chapters related to hygiene,  medicine and health care. Later, the extracted information is meticulously  classified and organised. Lastly, through a systematic literature review,  keywords search, data screening and comparative analysis, an in-depth and  comprehensive exploration and analysis of Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan is conducted  within the domains of hygiene, medicine and health care. RESULTS: Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan emphasizes the importance of personal hygiene  for ancient Indian monks and introduces the basic theories of ancient Indian  medicine. It compares ancient Indian and Chinese medicinal materials,  highlighting their respective roles in treating different diseases. Furthermore,  it briefly discusses the storage and processing of ancient Indian medicinal  materials, poisoning and toxicology, and ancient Indian health preservation  ideologies. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive and in-depth study of traditional ancient Indian  medicine, including Buddhist medicine and Ayurveda, and its application in the  religious environment and communities of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) aids in  understanding the treatment methods and health practices of ancient Indian  medicine. Additionally, it facilitates a deeper understanding of the  similarities, differences and exchange between Chinese and Indian medicine,  thereby opening up new horizons for future research.","According to 'Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan: exploration of and research on hygiene, medicine and health care knowledge in ancient India', a monk named Yi Jing traveled to India back in the day and noted how Indian monks took care of their health. He noticed they focused a lot on keeping clean, used different herbs and treatments to heal various diseases, and had methods to handle poisonous substances. This ancient Indian way of health and medicine was a bit different from what was practiced in China, but still, they had a lot in common. Studying this can help us understand more about ancient health practices and maybe even find something useful for today."
I've been hearing about Ayurveda as a holistic health approach. How can it help me feel more balanced and healthy overall?,"Ayurveda, the indigenous medical system of India, has integrated the concept of  interconnectedness into its understanding of health and disease. It considers  the human body as an indivisible whole with a network of interrelated functions,  mind and consciousness, wherein a disturbance in one part will have  repercussions in other parts as well. The key to health is for these factors to  maintain stability since disease is seen as a perturbation in this network.  Ayurvedic treatment aims not only at removal of disease, but also at the  restoration of the equilibrium of bodily functions. The centuries-old science of  Ayurveda, apart from being a holistic form of medicine, also clearly defines the  student-teacher and doctor-patient relationship. It sets high ethical standards  of professional and personal integrity for the doctor, teacher and student. In  addition to being technically skilled and well-read in the science,  practitioners of Ayurveda must be compassionate and empathetic. Students of  Ayurveda are taught the importance of compassionate caring for patients and  maintaining personal integrity.","According to 'Healthcare the Ayurvedic way', Ayurveda is an ancient health practice from India that sees the body, mind, and spirit as all interconnected. If one part is off balance, it can affect the rest. The goal is not just to cure sickness but to bring everything back into a harmonious balance. It's not just about being a good doctor or student in the technical sense, but also about being a kind and understanding person. So, think of it like a band: if the drummer is off, it can throw off the whole song. Ayurveda is about making sure every 'band member' in your body is in sync."
- I'm really interested in natural health treatments. Do you know any places where I can learn more about Ayurveda for free?,"In the name of Trillinga Ayurveda Vidya Peetham a seed for Ayurveda with a  school & free Ayurveda dispensary along with a Sanskrit school was sowed at  Warangal by some eminent devoted private practitioners of Ayurveda and  Philanthropists. The city of Warangal is a historical place and once a capital  of Kakatiya Kingdom, though it was part and parcel of Nizam dominion. In fact  such steps taken by Private Organisations for establishment of Ayurvedic system  of Medicine in Hyderabad and in Andhra region at Bejwada is appreciable.","According to ""Sown a seed of Ayurveda in the Nizam dominion"", some dedicated Ayurveda practitioners and kind-hearted individuals came together to start an Ayurveda school and a free clinic in Warangal. This city, famous for its history and once a capital of the Kakatiya Kingdom, was part of the Nizam territory. The effort to set up and promote Ayurvedic medicine in this region, and other places like Hyderabad and Bejwada, is really commendable."
I've been having these weird memory gaps and someone said it might be epilepsy. Can I use natural remedies to help manage it?,"This article discusses etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, and treatment of  epilepsy, as described in Charaka Samhitā (translation: Charaka's Compendium)  and Sushruta Samhitā, the two core texts of Ayurveda, an ancient system of  medicine. Ayurveda emphasized amnesia and loss of consciousness as core features  of epileptic seizures (Sanskrit: apasmar; translation: apa negation, smaran  memory) and recognized that seizures occur due to a disturbance in brain  function or flow of ""humors"" to the brain. Semiology of various seizure types  was well described. Epilepsy was attributed to both internal and multiple  exogenous factors. Treatment of epilepsy with formulations of naturally  occurring substances, their compounding and use, is described in remarkable  detail. Lifestyle modifications to protect people with epilepsy are also  documented. Cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy were recognized. Although none  of the Ayurveda formulations have any empirical evidence supporting their safety  or efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy, studies are needed to generate  relevant evidence, to recognize their hazards, and to integrate traditional and  complementary systems of medicine with modern health care in an informed and  safe manner.","According to 'Ancient Indian concepts about phenomenology, biology, and therapeutics of epilepsy', ancient Indian medicine, Ayurveda, had some interesting ideas about epilepsy. It saw memory loss and blackouts as key parts of a seizure and believed they happened because of issues in the brain or the flow of ""humors"" to the brain. They described different types of seizures in detail and thought they could be caused by a variety of factors. They treated epilepsy with natural substances and suggested lifestyle changes to help people with epilepsy. They even noticed that people with epilepsy can have cognitive issues. Even though we don't have scientific proof that these ancient treatments work, it's still worth studying them to see if they can be safely incorporated into modern medicine."
I've been having some trouble with my memory lately. Could this be related to something going on with my brain?,Comment on     World Neurosurg. 2011 Feb;75(2):320-3. doi: 10.1016/j.wneu.2010.09.007.,"According to 'Susruta: the father of surgery', Susruta is considered one of the earliest pioneers in the field of surgery.

"I've heard that Bacopa monnieri could help with memory and focus. Is it true that the more bacosides it has, the better it works?","Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. (BM) has been traditionally used in Ayurveda for  improving memory and cognitive deficits which is also evidenced through  experimental and clinical studies. The neuropharmacological properties of BM are  attributed to ""bacosides"", a complex mixture of saponin compounds. BM extracts  enriched with bacosides offers commercial advantage due to perceived higher  efficacy. However, there is no scientific data to support the same. In the  present study, methanolic extract of BM (BME) was compared with bacosides  enriched (BME-EF) vis a vis bacosides free fraction (BME-FF). Potential  antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity has been evaluated using  in vitro and in vivo methods. BME showed not only the highest anti-amnesic  efficacy but also antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity, followed  by either BME-FF or BME-EF. Interestingly, no significant differences were found  in between the groups. These findings dispel the notion that bacosides  enrichment enhances anti-amnesic efficacy and also suggests the contribution of  other components.","According to 'Bacosides enrichment does not improve the anti-amnesic effect of Bacopa monnieri: behavioural and biochemical evidences', Bacopa monnieri, a plant often used in traditional medicine to improve memory, doesn't necessarily work better when it's enriched with bacosides - a group of compounds found in the plant. The study found that the regular plant extract was just as good for memory and antioxidant activity as the versions with more or less bacosides. So, if you're considering using it as a memory booster, don't pay extra for versions claiming to have more bacosides."
Does traditional Chinese medicine have any simple health tips for a 20-year-old like me?,"Author information: (1)Institute of Science, Technology and Humanities, Shanghai University of  Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.","According to 'Comparing the concept of ""Removing Worms"" between traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda -- An example of Qiye Qingnian Powder', traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medicine system, both have ways of getting rid of harmful stuff in your body, kind of like getting rid of worms. They used an example of a specific Chinese medicine powder to explain it. So, different cultures might have different ways, but they're all trying to keep your body healthy and balanced in their own way."
I heard alternative medicine like Ayurveda can be really effective but I'm kinda skeptical. How can I be sure it's safe and works for someone my age?,"Bangladesh is now facing the public health problems of deficiency of iron and  iodine, especially for women. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of  Bangladesh has implemented strong countermeasures to enhance the health  condition of the nation. On the other hand, based on the concept of the  Declaration of Alma-Ata, complementary and alternative medicine should be used  more vigorously to enhance public health in the world. The usage of  complementary and alternative medicine such as ayurvedic medicine (AM) should be  increased in Bangladesh. Therefore we conducted the study on perceptions of AM  by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh in order to promote and enhance the effective  usage of AM, including herbal medicines as medical resources, from December 2010  to January 2011. This study showed younger citizens (61.1%) did not get more  benefit from AM than elder citizens (48.0%). On the other hand, younger citizens  (76.8%) did not get more harm from AM than elder citizens (70.1%). We think that  in terms of effectiveness of AM, the younger generation in Dhaka seems to be  more skeptical to AM than the elder generation in Dhaka, even though the younger  generation are more satisfied with AM than the elder generation. With viewpoint  of enhancement of usage of AM in Dhaka, we think that scientifically sound  information on AM should be collected rigorously and brought to the citizens  vigorously to remove the skeptical feeling of AM from younger citizen in Dhaka.  In terms of the effective utilization of limited medical resources, AM should be  used appropriately in Bangladesh, Asia and the world.","According to 'Perceptions of Ayurvedic medicine by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh', there's a health problem in Bangladesh because many people, particularly women, aren't getting enough iron and iodine in their diets. The government is trying to fix this, and one way they're looking into is using more traditional, natural medicine, like Ayurvedic medicine. This is stuff like herbal remedies that have been used in Asia for centuries. They did a study to see what people in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, think about Ayurvedic medicine. They found that young people didn't feel they benefited as much from it as older people did, and they were also a bit more skeptical about it. But, oddly enough, they were happier"
I've heard that some people use ayurvedic medicine for diabetes. What's in these medicines that helps control blood sugar levels?,"Diabetes mellitus, known as diabetes, is a challenging issue, and to control  diabetes, a large population is lining toward ayurvedic medicine. In the present  study, four brands of anti-diabetic ayurvedic medicines, along with a home  remedy, are analyzed using the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopic (LIBS)  technique. The study is carried out to know the elements responsible for  glycemic potential. The laser-induced breakdown (LIB) spectra elucidate the  presence of organic and inorganic elements like Al, Ba, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, H, K, Mg,  N, Na, O, Si, Sr, Zn, and the molecular band of CN molecule in medicines. LIBS  result also reveals Na and K's distinct concentration, which plays a vital role  in diabetes management. The presence of the CN band and organic elements  indicate the presence of organic molecular compositions in medicines. For  confirmation of organic composition in the drugs, Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy (FT-IR) has been performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on  the LIBS data of the medicines has been used for instant discrimination based on  their elemental/molecular compositions.","According to 'Evaluation of Na and K in anti-diabetic ayurvedic medicine using LIBS', researchers have looked into the ingredients in some Ayurvedic medications used to manage diabetes. They used a high-tech method (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy or LIBS) to find out what elements these medicines contain. They found a bunch of different elements like sodium (Na) and potassium (K), which are really important in controlling diabetes. They also found some organic elements, meaning that these medicines are made of natural compounds. So, if you're considering Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes, just know that science is finding out how these natural remedies could be helping."
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine lately. Is it really that effective and can it possibly help me live a healthier life?,"Ethnopharmacology and natural product drug discovery remains a significant hope  in the current target-rich, lead-poor scenario. Many modern drugs have origin in  traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology. Traditional Indian Medicine -  Ayurveda has a long history and is one of the great living traditions.  Considerable research on pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology and clinical  therapeutics has been carried out on Ayurvedic medicinal plants. Several  preclinical and clinical studies have examined cytoprotective, immunomodulatory  and immunoadjuvant potential of Ayurvedic medicines. The ethnopharmacology  knowledge, its holistic and systems approach supported by experiential base can  serve as an innovative and powerful discovery engine for newer, safer and  affordable medicines.","According to 'Ethnopharmacology and Drug Discovery', traditional Indian medicine, known as Ayurveda, has been around for ages and is still going strong. Researchers have been looking at plants used in Ayurveda for their healing properties. They've found that some of these plants can help protect our cells and boost our immune system. So, Ayurveda could potentially be a great source for new, safe, and affordable medicines. Guess we could learn a thing or two from our ancestors, huh?"
I've heard about this Ayurveda thing with the three doshas. Can you explain how they relate to my health and well-being?,"It has been said that the tridosha theory in Ayurveda originated from the theory  of the three elements of the universe. The names of these three doshas, which  are roughly equivalent to humour, are vata (wind), pitta (bile), and Kapha  (phlegm), corresponding to the three elements of the universe: air, fire, and  water. On the other hand, Buddhist medicine which has a close relation to  Ayurveda is based on the theory of the four elements of the universe which  includes the earth as well as the three elements mentioned above. Greek medicine  on the other hand, is founded on the theory of the four humours, i.e. blood,  yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Furthermore, even in Ayurveda, like in  ""Sushruta Samhita"", the theory of the four humours can be found: this includes  the above-mentioned tridosha plus blood as the fourth humour. ""Timaios"" by Plato  also mentions this. We compared these various theories and pointed out that the  tridosha theory had its origin in the theory of the four elements of the  universe. The process of the formation of the tridosha theory is considered as  follows: (1) ""Earth"" was segregated from the four elements of the universe owing  to its solid properties, and was rearranged into the seven elements of the body  called ""dhatu""; and the other three elements. ""water"", ""fire"", and ""air"", were  integrated as the tridosha theory, namely, the theory of the three humours,  owing to their properties of fluid; (2) ""Blood"", assigned to the element of  ""earth"", was segregated from the tridosha because ""blood"" was considered to be  comprised of the properties of every humour without having its own peculiar  properties. Therefore, the diseases caused by deranged ""blood"" were regarded as  an aggregate disease caused by the other three deranged humours. Then the  category of the disease, caused by deranged ""earth"", did not appear.","According to 'Comparative studies of the tridosha theory in Ayurveda and the theory of the four deranged elements in Buddhist medicine', Ayurveda and Buddhist medicine have different ways of explaining how our bodies work. Ayurveda talks about three elements: vata (like wind), pitta (like bile), and Kapha (like phlegm), which match up to air, fire, and water in the universe. Buddhist medicine adds a fourth element, earth. The Ayurvedic concept is like saying our bodies are run by three kinds of energy, while Buddhist medicine says there are four. But both theories have roots in the idea that our bodies and the universe are made up of the same stuff. It's like how"

I've been hearing a lot about these AYUSH wellness centers in India. Do you think they're worth checking out for my health issues?,"The double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases is a major threat  to the Indian public health system. AYUSH, an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and  Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy, represents the Indian  system of medicine recognized by the Government of India. Mainstreaming of AYUSH  is one of the key strategies of the Indian government for tackling increasing  disease burden through initiatives such as AYUSH wellness centers, telemedicine,  and quality control measures for medications in the AYUSH system of medicine.  Such investment of resources in health systems may require economic evaluations.  However, such evaluations are lacking in the AYUSH system, except for a few in  homeopathy and yoga. In the absence of evidence from economic evaluations,  researchers and decision makers are guided mostly by clinical efficacy while  formulating healthcare strategies. In view of the increasing use of AYUSH across  the country, economic evaluations of the AYUSH system are the need of the hour  to aid healthcare decision making.","According to 'Promoting health economic evaluation studies in the AYUSH system of medicine: the need of the hour', India is dealing with a lot of health issues and the government is trying to tackle this problem using a holistic approach that includes traditional Indian medical practices like Ayurveda, Yoga, and Homeopathy. However, despite these efforts, there isn't enough data to show if this system is cost-effective or not. So, the government needs to look into this more to make sure they're making the best decisions for the country's health."
"So, there's been some talk about traditional Indian medicine helping with COVID-19. Is there any truth to this?","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a great  burden on governments and the medical fraternity globally. Many clinical studies  from the Indian system of Traditional Medicines [Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy,  Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)] have been carried out to find  appropriate solutions. Through a living systematic review and meta-analysis,  this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Traditional System of  Indian Medicine (AYUSH system) in lowering the incidence, duration, and severity  of COVID-19. Methods: We will search the following databases: Pubmed; the  Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL); the Clinical Trials  Registry - India (CTRI); Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles  (DHARA); AYUSH research portal; Google scholar and World Health Organization  (WHO) COVID-19 database. Clinical improvement, WHO ordinal scale, viral  clearance, incidences of COVID-19 infection, and mortality will be considered as  primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be use of O2 therapy or mechanical  ventilator, admission to high dependency unit or emergency unit, duration of  hospitalization, the time to symptom resolution, and adverse events. Data will  be synthesized, with RevMan 5.4 tool and the risk of bias will be assessed with  RoB 2 (for RCTs) and ROBINS I (for NRSIs). Certainty of evidence will be  assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development  and Evaluations) tool. The review will be updated bi-monthly with two updates.  Conclusion: This living systematic review will be the first to address AYUSH  interventions in COVID-19, synthesizing the full spectrum of Indian Traditional  System of Medicine against COVID-19. It will facilitate professionals, guideline  developers, and authorities with up to date synthesis on interventions  periodically to make health-care decisions on AYUSH therapies in the management  of COVID-19.","According to 'Impact of AYUSH interventions on COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review and meta-analysis', there's a big study going on to see if traditional Indian medicine can help with COVID-19.

They're looking at whether these can lower the chances of getting COVID-19, make it less severe, or even shorten how long it lasts. They're also checking if these methods can reduce hospital stays and the need for things like oxygen therapy or ventilators. This research is ongoing and the results are updated regularly to help health professionals make the best decisions."
"I've been feeling super heavy and cold all the time, could this be related to something in Ayurvedic medicine like Vata and Kapha?","Hot (Ushna) and cold (sheet) are two fundamental precepts of Ayurvedic medicine  reflected variously within the context of health and disease. These are  fundamental for being essential attributes of three doshas, namely, Vata, Pitta,  and Kapha, forming the very basis of Ayurvedic constructs of health and disease.  Ushna is the inherent property of Pitta, symbolizing fire both inside and  outside the body. There are pathologies of Pitta where this Ushna property  participates in pathogenesis to present the features like burning, sour  eructation, and fever. In such cases, the course of treatment eventually focuses  on reducing Pitta or reducing the Ushna property of Pitta, in particular. A  similar cold association is found with Vata and Kapha, where the pathogenesis is  reflected as heaviness, cold and cough, and edema. The treatment of Vata and  Kapha diseases eventually focuses upon their reduction or reducing cold-related  pathogenesis, in particular. This is evident that these two form an essential  and integral component of Ayurvedic understanding of health and disease and are  practically applied to make a diagnosis and define the treatment. In this  chapter, we are expanding the details of Ushna and Sheeta constructs of  Ayurvedic medicine and elaborating on their health and disease application.","According to 'Principle of Hot (Ushna) and Cold (Sheeta) and Its Clinical Application in Ayurvedic Medicine', Ayurvedic medicine has a unique way of looking at health. It believes in two basic principles called hot (Ushna) and cold (Sheeta) that are linked to three bodily elements: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. If you're feeling things like burning sensations, sour belching, or fever, Ayurveda would say your 'Pitta' or 'hot' element is acting up. The goal would then be to cool things down. On the other hand, if you're experiencing symptoms like feeling heavy, having a cold or cough, or swelling, your 'V"
I sometimes zone out and lose track of what's happening around me. Could this be related to that Apasmara thing I read about in Ayurveda?,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, meaning science of life, is the  oldest system of medicine in the world. Epilepsy is defined as Apasmara: apa,  meaning negation or loss of; smara, meaning recollection or consciousness. Aura  was recognized and was called Apasmara Poorva Roopa. A large number of symptoms  indicative of aura were listed. Worthy of mention are subjective sensation of  sounds, sensation of darkness, feeling of delusion, and dream-like state. An  actual attack of Apasmara includes falling down; shaking of the hands, legs, and  body; rolling up of the eyes; grinding of the teeth; and foaming at the mouth.  Four major types of epilepsy based on the disturbance of doshas (humors) that  govern the physiological and physiochemical activities of the body are  mentioned. Apasmara is considered a dangerous disease that is chronic and  difficult to treat. Several causes are mentioned. Treatment included correcting  the etiological factors and dietary regimen and avoiding dangerous places that  may result in injuries.","According to 'Epilepsy in ancient India', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system, had its own way to understand and deal with epilepsy. They called it 'Apasmara', which means losing consciousness or memory. They also recognized the early signs of an epilepsy attack, which they named 'Apasmara Poorva Roopa'. This included hearing things that aren't there, seeing darkness, feeling lost, and feeling like you're in a dream. The actual attack was described as falling down, shaking uncontrollably, eyes rolling, teeth grinding, and foaming at the mouth. They believed that epilepsy was a serious and long-term illness that was tough to treat. The Ayurvedic treatment included addressing the root causes, following a"
I've been dealing with chronic pain and nothing seems to help. Could an Ayurvedic approach like adjusting my diet or lifestyle help me manage it better?,"Background: Ayurveda's preventive focus complements its strength with the  interventionist approach of the biomedical in chronic pain self-management.  Patient-centered care (PCC) using ethnomedicine promises greater patient  self-management; however, few studies have examined environmental relationships  and PCC in self-management of chronic pain through Ayurveda. Objective: To  examine how Ayurveda's philosophical focus on whole system frameworks describes  the integration of the individual and the ecological in tailoring an integrative  patient-centered diagnostic and prognostic approach to chronic pain management.  Methods: This qualitative case study conducted in-depth semi-structured  interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India (N = 10) and a qualitative  inductive content analytic approach. Findings: The diagnostic and  interpretational framework of the doshas supports the integration of the  individual and the ecological through (a) the circadian and seasonal cycles  relating mind-body awareness with diet, lifestyle (e.g., yoga), and breath  (e.g., pranayama), and (b) biogeographical and ecosystemic regions relating the  biogeographical and the ecological (e.g., desh) with the regulatory principle of  pain and its physiological and anatomical perception (vata) in an approach that  goes beyond treating pain etiology to a whole person PCC approach. Conclusions:  The study highlights how circadian and seasonal cycles and evolutionary  spatial-temporal factors of biogeographical and ecological regions are employed  in patient assessment and self-management to support patient involvement.  Recommendations for PCC in integrative chronic pain management include  supporting patient ownership of their care through the dosha framework that  relates the individual and the ecological in the patient's own life-context and  supports co-creation of a collaborative plan of care using an ethnomedical  framework.","According to 'Patient Assessment and Chronic Pain Self-Management in Ethnomedicine: Seasonal and Ecosystemic Embodiment in Ayurvedic Patient-Centered Care', Ayurvedic medicine - a traditional Indian form of healing - uses a unique approach to help manage chronic pain. It considers not just the person, but the world around them too. The study found that the rhythms of the day and seasons, as well as our physical surroundings, can influence our health. This means that things like regular sleep, a good diet, activities like yoga, and even breathing exercises can help manage pain. The idea is to give patients more control over their health and work with doctors to create a tailored plan that fits into their lifestyle. So, it suggests that"
Could traditional Indian herbs help with COVID-19 or other respiratory infections?,"Traditional Indian medical practices (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy)  are a vast reservoir of knowledge about medicinal plants. The promising  pharmacological properties of these plants have paved the way for developing  therapy against novel Coronavirus (CoV) infection. The current review will  summarize published works of literature on the effects of traditional Indian  medicinal plants against acute respiratory infection (COVID-19, SARS, Influenza,  and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and registered clinical trials of  traditional Indian herbal medicines in COVID-19. The current study aims to  comprehensively evaluate the data of traditional Indian medicinal plants to  warrant their use in COVID-19 management. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases  were searched along with different clinical trial databases. A total of 22  relevant traditional Indian medicinal plants (35 relevant studies) were included  in the current study having potential antiviral properties against virus-induced  respiratory illness along with promising immunomodulatory and thrombolytic  properties. Further, 36 randomized and nonrandomized registered clinical trials  were also included that were aimed at evaluating the efficacy of herbal plants  or their formulations in COVID-19 management. The antiviral, immunomodulatory,  and thrombolytic activities of the traditional Indian medicinal plants laid down  a strong rationale for their use in developing therapies against SARS-CoV-2  infection. The study identified some important potential traditional Indian  medicinal herbs such as Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes  bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda,  Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and  Kabusura kudineer, which could be used in therapeutic strategies against  SARS-CoV-2 infection.","According to 'Promising traditional Indian medicinal plants for the management of novel Coronavirus disease: A systematic review', some plants used in traditional Indian medicine could be pretty helpful in treating COVID-19. These plants, like holy basil, giloy, and ginger, have properties that can help your body fight off viruses and manage symptoms. Some of these plants are already being tested in clinical trials to see how effective they are. So, it seems like these traditional remedies might actually have some serious potential in helping us deal with this pandemic."

"So, I heard that this Ephedra juice could help with longevity. Is it something I could include in my diet to stay healthy?","Ephedra juice is used as the drink of longevity given even to the new born. This  is an Aryan custom mentioned in Rigveda and followed even by the Romans. To  trace the history of this custom would lead to identifying Soma = Ephedra. The  original species of Ephedra or Soma proper would be Ephedra sinica, the Chinese  plant. It is the one species with yellow stalks. This has been illustrated so  that it confirms Rigveda speaking of Soma as ""golden yellow."" The name Soma is  also a loan word from Chinese meaning ""fire-yellow fibers of hemp."" The plant  Soma is described as ""thousand boughs"" and photographic evidence has been  offered in support. Each stalk is rod-like resembling an arrow as Rigveda speaks  of it.

I've been hearing a lot about traditional Indian medicine lately. What kind of health benefits could practices like Yoga or Ayurveda offer to someone like me?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Indian medicine is one of the oldest  medical systems and remains popular worldwide. Traditional medicine systems in  China and India have historical origins pertaining to mutual learning,  reference, and development from medical theory to the drugs used. The exchange  of traditional medicine between China and India began in the Qin and Han  Dynasties (221 BC-220 AD), prospered in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and  declined after the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). It was also directly related to  the rise and fall of Buddhism. The traditional medicines of the two countries  are highly complementary because of differences in geographical climate and the  modernisation process of traditional medicine. AIM: This review aimed to understand the spread and development of traditional  Indian medicine in China to further promote exchange and cooperation between  China and India in the field of traditional medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE via PubMed,  CNKI, Science Direct, Sci-Hub, and other databases using the terms 'traditional  Indian medicine' or 'Indian medicine' or 'Ayurveda' or 'Yoga' or 'Unani', and  limiting the search to articles published between 1958 and 2019. We analysed the  sources, publication date, type, and topic of the retrieved articles/studies. RESULTS: Based on the results of research on traditional Indian medicine carried  out by Chinese scholars, 518 academic papers and 60 classic works published in  China and abroad were collected. The results showed the following. First,  Chinese scholars have systematically investigated traditional Indian medicine  including its composition, management, and education; the scale of medicinal and  pharmaceutical plants; protective measures of intellectual property rights of  traditional medicine; and international promotion of Yoga. Second, studies have  examined the development status of traditional Indian medicine in China  including the spread of Yoga in the country and the industrial scale of,  education in, existing problems in, and clinical research on Yoga. In addition,  Chinese scholars conducted research on and the translation of classic works and  terms of Ayurveda, and studied the theory, treatment, and medicine thereof.  Third, the historical exchange and trading status of traditional medicine  between India and China have been discussed, including the exchange of  traditional medicine between the two countries, effect of traditional Indian  medicine on Chinese Buddhism, and minority medicine and trade in medicinal  materials between the two countries. CONCLUSION: India attaches great importance to the management of, education in,  and industry of traditional medicine, and has made various efforts to protect  intellectual property rights. Indian Yoga is very popular in China, and Chinese  scholars have conducted some clinical research thereon. However, regulatory  systems and legislation for Yoga are lacking in China. At present, traditional  Chinese medicine scholars have an enhanced understanding of the term Yoga and  less knowledge of the terms Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and similar concepts. We  suggest that Chinese scholars further study the classic works, basic theories,  treatment of clinical diseases, medicinal materials, and prescriptions  compounding traditional Indian medicine. The results of this study highlight  directions for Chinese scholars to pursue in further studying traditional Indian  medicine comprehensively, and will help promote exchange and cooperation between  China and India in the field of traditional medicine.","According to 'Traditional Indian medicine in China: The status quo of recognition, development and research', India and China have a long history of sharing and developing traditional medicine. Apparently, Indian yoga is super popular in China, though there's not enough regulation around it. The paper suggests that Chinese researchers should dive deeper into other Indian medical practices beyond yoga, like Ayurveda and Unani. This could help China and India work together more in the field of traditional medicine and learn from each other's practices."
I've been hearing a lot about this ancient remedy called Mahayograj Guggul for joint pain. Is there any scientific proof that it actually works?,"Mahayograj Guggul is an ancient ayurvedic medicine, prescribed for various joint  disorders like arthritis, gout, and rheumatism. The present research was  envisaged to develop a simple, sensitive, and comprehensive analytical method  for standardization of Mahayograj Guggul. The analysis was conducted for gallic  acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, cinnamic acid, piperine,  guggulsterone-E, and guggulsterone-Z by high-performance thin-layer  chromatography, and additionally ferulic acid, ellagic acid, and picroside I by  ultra high-performance liquid chromatography. These developed methods were  validated as per international guidelines, and were found linear (r2  > 0.99),  sensitive, precise (relative standard deviation < 5%), and accurate with  recovery values (85-105%). The limit of detection and quantification were in the  range of 0.11-23.6 and 0.33-71.51 μg/g. Gas chromatography tandem mass  spectrometry was used to develop Mahayograj Guggul fingerprinting profile and to  identify mid-polar or nonpolar compounds. Proximate analysis was used to  ascertain the functional groups present in Mahayograj Guggul. Ultra  high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography tandem mass  spectrometry were further employed to authenticate quality reproducibility in  the active ingredients of Mahayograj Guggul in six commercial batches. Taken  together, these analytical methods provide a scientific basis and reference for  quality control evaluation of Mahayograj Guggul and similar traditional  broad-spectrum formulations.","According to ""Standardization and validation of phytometabolites by UHPLC and high-performance thin layer chromatography for rapid quality assessment of ancient ayurvedic medicine, Mahayograj Guggul"", scientists have developed a way to test the quality of an ancient herbal medicine called Mahayograj Guggul. This medicine has been used for a long time to treat things like arthritis and gout. The scientists' tests checked for specific ingredients in the medicine and were able to accurately measure them. They even checked six batches from the market to make sure the quality was consistent. This means that you can now be more certain of what you're getting when you buy this medicine."
I've been having some digestion issues and heart palpitations lately. I heard ginger might help - is that true?,"The rhizome of the Zingiber officinale Roscoe, a biennial herb growing in South  Asia, is commonly known as ginger. Ginger is used in clinical disorders, such as  constipation, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting and its use is also  recommended by the traditional medicine for cardiopathy, high blood pressure,  palpitations and as a vasodilator to improve the circulation. The decoction of  ginger rhizome is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine. In this papery by  high-performance liquid chromatography, we have seen that its main phytomarkers  were 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol and 6-shogaol and we report the effects of the  decoction of ginger rhizome on cardiovascular parameters and on vascular and  intestinal smooth muscle. In our experimental models, the decoction of ginger  shows weak negative inotropic and chronotropic intrinsic activities but a  significant intrinsic activity on smooth muscle with a potency on ileum is  greater than on aorta: EC50 = 0.66 mg/mL versus EC50 = 1.45 mg/mL.","According to 'Ayurvedic preparation of Zingiber officinale Roscoe: effects on cardiac and on smooth muscle parameters', ginger, a common spice you might find in the kitchen, has some interesting health benefits. Besides helping with common issues like constipation, stomach upset, or nausea, it seems like it might be useful for heart health and blood pressure too. Researchers have found that a tea made from ginger has some effects on heart rhythm and muscle relaxation. They found it worked particularly well on a type of muscle found in the gut, which might be why it's good for those stomach problems. Anyway, next time you're feeling a bit off, why not try a cup of ginger tea?"

This paper presents a hypothetical model for the removal of toxins from  the physiology employing procedures of Maharishi Ayurveda, a comprehensive  system of natural medicine, which is undergoing renewal. This model combines the  use of principles similar to those which are found in lipid extraction, dialysis  and bulk flow. A means of testing the hypothesis is also presented.","According to 'A model for extraction of both lipid and water soluble toxins using a procedure from Maharishi Ayurveda', there's a lot of harmful stuff in our environment that can mess with our health. This study talks about a way to help our bodies get rid of these toxins using methods from Maharishi Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine. It's kind of like giving your body a really thorough detox, and they've even got a way to test if it works."
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately. What kind of natural remedies does it use and have any of these been scientifically tested or proven?,"Ayurveda is the ancient (before 2500 b.c.) Indian system of health care and  longevity. It involves a holistic view of man, his health, and illness.  Ayurvedic treatment of a disease consists of salubrious use of drugs, diets, and  certain practices. Medicinal preparations are invariably complex mixtures, based  mostly on plant products. Around 1,250 plants are currently used in various  Ayurvedic preparations. Many Indian medicinal plants have come under scientific  scrutiny since the middle of the nineteenth century, although in a sporadic  fashion. The first significant contribution from Ayurvedic materia medica came  with the isolation of the hypertensive alkaloid from the sarpagandha plant  (Rouwolfia serpentina), valued in Ayurveda for the treatment of hypertension,  insomnia, and insanity. This was the first important ancient-modern concordance  in Ayurvedic plants. With the gradual coming of age of chemistry and biology,  disciplines central to the study of biologic activities of natural products,  many Ayurvedic plants have been reinvestigated. Our work on Commiphora wightti  gum-resin, valued in Ayurveda for correcting lipid disorders, has been described  in some detail; based on these investigations, a modern antihyperlipoproteinemic  drug is on the market in India and some other countries. There has also been  concordance for a few other Ayurvedic crude drugs such as Asparagus racemosus,  Cedrus deodara, and Psoralea corylifolia.","According to 'Ancient-modern concordance in Ayurvedic plants: some examples', Ayurveda is an old Indian health care system that's all about looking at the whole person, not just one sick part. It uses special blends of medicinal plants in its treatments. For example, there's a plant called sarpagandha that was traditionally used for high blood pressure, insomnia, and mental health issues. Modern science has found that this plant actually does have a medicinal component that can treat these conditions. The same goes for some other plants used in Ayurveda. It's like the ancient knowledge is getting a high-five from modern science. The researchers also looked at a plant used in Ayurveda to manage cholesterol, and now"
"I heard aconite is super poisonous, but that it's used in Ayurveda. So, like, is it safe after it's been processed or what?","Crude aconite is an extremely lethal substance. However, the science of Ayurveda  looks upon aconite as a therapeutic entity. Crude aconite is always processed  i.e. it undergoes 'samskaras' before being utilised in the Ayurvedic  formulations. This study was undertaken in mice, to ascertain whether  'processed' aconite is less toxic as compared to the crude or unprocessed one.  It was seen that crude aconite was significantly toxic to mice (100% mortality  at a dose of 2.6 mg/mouse) whereas the fully processed aconite was absolutely  non-toxic (no mortality at a dose even 8 times as high as that of crude  aconite). Further, all the steps in the processing were essential for complete  detoxification.","According to 'Can we dispense with Ayurvedic samskaras?', aconite is a super deadly stuff if taken raw. But in Ayurveda, which is like an ancient Indian healthcare system, they process aconite in a way that it becomes safe and can be used for treatments. This study tested both raw and processed aconite on mice, and found that the raw one was super harmful (all mice died), but the processed one had no harm at all, even when given in much bigger dose. So, the conclusion? Every step in the Ayurvedic processing is crucial to make aconite safe to use."
"I've heard about free radicals affecting health. Is there a natural way to manage them, like through diet or lifestyle changes?","This is a comprehensive review of menace of free radicals and its concept and  management in Ayurveda. This article highlights the various exogenous and  endogenous factors responsible for the production of free radicals with special  reference to the formation of unriped and purified metabolites (ama) during the  metabolic activities at different levels of digestion. The purpose of this paper  is to review the management of free radicals which can be designed with  reference to diet and digestion biorhythms, behaviour, emotions and sense.  Ayurvedic concept of free radicals scavenger, revitalisation, role of clarified  butter and pollution control thereby maintaining the optimal health status by  involving minimum of sophisticated technology thus guiding the individual to  lead a harmonious life in unison with nature.","According to 'The menace of free radicals its concept and management in Ayurveda', free radicals are harmful bits that can pop up in your body due to factors like unhealthy food or stress. They're kind of like the junk that piles up in your room when you're not cleaning regularly. The paper suggests handling these free radicals using Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine. This can include eating a balanced diet, keeping a regular sleep schedule, managing your emotions, and even using clarified butter (like ghee). It's all about living in sync with nature!"
I've been having problems with my joints and I've tried different medications but they're not working. Do you think Ayurveda could help me out?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda has its historical roots in India, but has also been  internationalised, partly via migration and partly through an increased interest  in alternative medicine in the West, where studies point toward increased use.  However, there is to date scarce knowledge about the use and experiences of  ayurveda in Sweden. METHODS: We have conducted a case study of a center for ayurvedic healthcare in  Sweden. We have collected information on client background data from the  center's documentation, and compiled data from all clients who visited the  centre for ayurvedic consultation during spring 2014. In total, 55 individuals  were included in the study, and 18 of them were chosen for individual  semi-structured interviews, to gain a deeper understanding of their motives for  seeking, and experiences of ayurvedic health care. The material was analysed and  compiled through a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Among the 55 clients, 91% were female the mean age was 47 years, and  64% gave a specific illness as a reason for seeking ayurveda. The most common  illnesses were respiratory, musculoskeletal, circulatory, tumor, and cutaneous  illnesses. The qualitative results showed that ayurveda was being used in  combination with other methods, including various diets, other alternative  medicine methods and conventional medicine. Some participants recounted having  sought ayurveda as a complement to conventional medicine, or in cases when  conventional medicine had been experienced as insufficient in terms of diagnosis  or treatment. However, some participants experienced it as difficult to follow  the ayurvedic life-style advice in the midst of their everyday life. Many  participants reported positive experiences of pulse diagnostics, which was the  main diagnostic method used in ayurvedic consultation. Some reported concrete,  physical improvement of their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study points towards important aspects of participant  experience of ayurveda, that may be subject to further research. The positive  effects experienced by some clients should be studied more systematically in  order to discern whether they are specific or non-specific. In addition,  interesting knowledge may be gained through further study of the reported  positive experiences of pulse diagnosis.","Based on 'The use of ayurvedic medicine in the context of health promotion--a mixed methods case study of an ayurvedic centre in Sweden', Ayurveda, an alternative medicine from India, is getting more popular in the West, including Sweden. The study looked at people who went to an Ayurvedic center in Sweden and found that most of them are middle-aged women who were dealing with specific health issues. They used Ayurveda along with other treatments like different diets, other alternative medicines, and even conventional medicine. Some turned to Ayurveda because they felt regular medicine wasn't helping them enough. But sticking to the Ayurvedic lifestyle wasn't always easy for them. A lot of them, however, liked the pulse diagnosis"
"I've heard that Ayurvedic medicines come from plants and stuff, but I'm worried about radiation or other harmful things being in them. Should I be concerned?","Purpose: Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicines in the world being  practiced widely in the Indian subcontinent for more than 3000 years, and still  remains as one of the important traditional health care systems. The Ayurvedic  drugs are derived primarily from various parts of the plants, like root, leaf,  flower, fruit or plant as a whole. Plants uptake minerals and other nutrients  from the soil through their root system. Along with other minerals radionuclides  present in the growing media also reach to the plant parts following the same  pathway. Realizing the probable health hazards via the intake of Ayurvedic  drugs, it is important to assess the concentration of natural radionuclides in  commonly used medicinal plants.Materials and methods: NaI(Tl) scintillator-based  gamma-ray spectrometry has been used to determine the activity concentrations of  primordial radionuclides (226Ra, 232Th and 40K) in the most commonly used  medicinal plant parts as ingredients of Ayurvedic medicines in India.Results and  discussion: The average specific activity (Bqkg-1) of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K was  found to be 43 ± 18, 36 ± 15[Formula: see text] and 230 ± 46, respectively. The  estimated annual committed effective doses due to the intake of common Ayurvedic  medicines at prescribed dosage was found to be 39 ± 16 µSv y-1,[Formula: see  text] which is quite low as compared with the radiation dose limit of 1 mSvy-1  from all natural sources, reported by the International Commission on  Radiological Protection (ICRP-60).Conclusions: It is found categorically that  intake of Ayurvedic medicines at normal dosage poses no radiological hazard to  the individual. Present results are significant in the wake of myths that many  hazardous materials including radioisotopes are present at higher levels.  Obtained results also serve as a reference information for the distribution of  radionuclides in medicinal plant species.","According to 'Radionuclide concentrations in medicinal florae and committed effective dose through Ayurvedic medicines', Ayurveda is a super old traditional health care system that's been used in India for more than 3000 years. Most of the medicines are made from various parts of plants, and these plants can absorb stuff like minerals and even radionuclides from the ground. But don't freak out. The study found that the amount of radionuclides in the plants used for Ayurvedic medicines is pretty small. So, even if you're using Ayurvedic medicines regularly, the dose of radiation you get is way lower than the safe limit set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Basically, taking Ayurved"
I've been having some back and neck pain lately. Are there any natural treatments I could try that won't have negative side effects?,"INTRODUCTION: Low back and neck pain are common musculoskeletal disorders with  multiple treatment options. India's traditional medical systems, known as Ayush  (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy)  offer range of interventions and are widely used. In view of limited  documentation of adverse events following Ayush interventions for lumbar and  cervical spondylosis, we synthesized evidence and estimated proportion of  studies reporting adverse events. METHODS: We systematically searched all published documents from biomedical and  multidisciplinary abstract and citation databases and Ayush-specific  repositories from their inception to April 2021. We selected studies as per  inclusion criteria and extracted information, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We  systematically reviewed the qualitative evidence form the selected studies. RESULTS: Majority (94%) of the selected 113 studies were interventional studies  and included 77 (68.1%) journal articles and 35 (31%) academic dissertations.  Among the Ayush systems, considerable proportion was from Ayurveda (32.7%),  followed by Siddha (24.8%), Yoga (22.1%), Unani (15.9%) and Homoeopathy (4.4%).  Almost three-fourths of the studies were on lumbar spondylosis (65%; n = 74),  followed by cervical spondylosis (31%; n = 35), and the remaining four included  both. Thirteen percent of the 113 studies described adverse events [Yoga = 9.7%;  Unani = 1.8% and Homoeopathy = 1.8%]. More adverse events were reported among  the studies on lumbar (9.7%) than cervical spondylosis (2.7%). The nature of  interventions were non-pharmacological (10.6%; n = 12), pharmacological (n = 2;  1.8%) or combined (n = 1; 0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Only one in eight studies reported any adverse event following  Ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis. There could be certain  degree of underreporting of adverse events and requires further exploration.  PROSPERO Registration ID CRD42020167433.","According to 'Adverse events in India's Ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis: a systematic review', a review of 113 studies on traditional Indian healing methods (like Ayurveda, Yoga, and others) for neck and back pain found that only about 13% of them reported any bad side effects. Most of these studies were on treatments for lower back pain, and a majority of the reported side effects came from this group. The review suggests that there might be some underreporting of these side effects, so they're going to look into it more."
I have a lot of joint pain after working out. Are there any natural remedies that could help with this?,"BACKGROUND: Plant species have long been used as principal ingredients of  traditional medicine in far-west Nepal. The medicinal plants with ethnomedicinal  values are currently being screened for their therapeutic potential but their  data and information are inadequately compared and analyzed with the Ayurveda  and the phytochemical findings. METHODS: The present study evaluated ethnomedicinal plants and their uses  following literature review, comparison, field observations, and analysis.  Comparison was made against earlier standard literature of medicinal plants and  ethnomedicine of the same area, the common uses of the Ayurveda and the latest  common phytochemical findings. The field study for primary data collection was  carried out from 2006-2008. RESULTS: The herbal medicine in far-west Nepal is the basis of treatment of most  illness through traditional knowledge. The medicine is made available via  ancient, natural health care practices such as tribal lore, home herbal remedy,  and the Baidhya, Ayurveda and Amchi systems. The traditional herbal medicine has  not only survived but also thrived in the trans-cultural environment with its  intermixture of ethnic traditions and beliefs. The present assessment showed  that traditional herbal medicine has flourished in rural areas where modern  medicine is parsimoniously accessed because of the high cost and long travel  time to health center. Of the 48 Nepalese medicinal plants assessed in the  present communication, about half of the species showed affinity with the common  uses of the Ayurveda, earlier studies and the latest phytochemical findings. The  folk uses of Acacia catechu for cold and cough, Aconitum spicatum as an  analgesic, Aesculus indica for joint pain, Andrographis paniculata for fever,  Anisomeles indica for urinary affections, Azadirachta indica for fever,  Euphorbia hirta for asthma, Taxus wallichiana for tumor control, and Tinospora  sinensis for diabetes are consistent with the latest pharmacological findings,  common Ayurvedic and earlier uses. CONCLUSIONS: Although traditional herbal medicine is only a primary means of  health care in far-west Nepal, the medicine has been pursued indigenously with  complementing pharmacology and the Ayurveda. Therefore, further pharmacological  evaluation of traditional herbal medicine deserves more attention.","According to 'Traditional herbal medicine in far-west Nepal: a pharmacological appraisal', people in far-west Nepal have been using plants as medicine for a long time. These aren't just random plants, they have special properties that can help with health problems. This study was trying to understand more about these plants and how they are used. The researchers found that about half of the 48 plants they studied are used in ways that match up with old-school Ayurveda (an ancient Indian system of medicine) and recent scientific findings. For example, the plant Acacia catechu is used for colds and coughs, just like in Ayurveda and recent studies. They concluded that these traditional herbal medicines are really important in these areas, especially where it"
Is there any basic health advice or traditional Chinese remedies that might help with my everyday wellness?,"Author information: (1)School of Basic Medical Science, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese  Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China.","According to 'Analysis on the unearthed Khotanese remaining prescription P. 2899v in the Library Grottoes at Dunhuang', there was some pretty cool ancient medical knowledge found in a cave in China. This kind of discovery gives us a peek into how people used to handle health issues way back in the day."
"So, Ayurvedic medicine is pretty old-school, right? Do you think it's still as effective as modern treatments for stuff like stress or anxiety?","Ayurveda traces its origins to contributions of mythological and real physicians  that lived millennia earlier. In many respects, Western medicine also had  similar origins and beliefs, however, the introduction of anatomical dissection  and progressive application of scientific evidence based practices have resulted  in divergent paths taken by these systems. We examined the lives, careers, and  contributions made by nine ancient Indian physicians. Ancient texts,  translations of these texts, books, and biographical works were consulted to  obtain relevant information, both for Indian traditional medicine as well as for  Western medicine. Ayurveda has retained principles enunciated by these  physicians, with minor conceptual advances over the centuries. Western medicine  separated from ancient Indian medicine several hundred years ago, and remains  the foundation of modern medicine. Modern medicine is evidence based, and  randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard by which efficacy of  treatment is evaluated. Ayurvedic medicine has not undergone such critical  evaluation to any large extent. The few RCTs that have evaluated alternative  medical treatment recently have shown that such therapy is no better than  placebo; however, placebo treatment is 30% effective. We suggest that foreign  domination, initially by Mughals, and later by the British, may have  contributed, in part, to this inertia and protracted status quo.","According to ""Contributions of ancient Indian physicians--implications for modern times"", Ayurveda and Western medicine started off in similar ways thousands of years ago, but they've gone down different paths. Western medicine started doing things like dissecting bodies and running scientific tests, which made it change into the modern medicine we use today. Ayurveda kept more of the original ideas from these ancient doctors, but hasn't made many big concept changes over time. While modern medicine uses a lot of scientific testing, like randomized clinical trials, to check if treatments work, Ayurveda hasn't really done that. The few tests done on alternative medicine like Ayurveda show that it's about as effective as a placebo (which is basically a fake treatment but"
I'm kinda into rare books and stuff. Could you tell me about some unique ones in Urdu from way back?,"Urdu is a distinct literary language began to develop in India during Mughal  empire. Lots of people read, write and speak, this language in Indian  subcontinent. This brief article will shed light on the seven rare books in Urdu  compiled and published in the period from 19th century to the first half of the  current century. Some books may not have high value but the struggle of the  scholars, is appreciable.","According to 'Ayurvedic literature in Urdu', Urdu, a language that started becoming its own thing in India during the Mughal empire, is pretty popular. This paper is about seven rare Urdu books from between the 1800s and the first half of the 1900s.

I've been hearing about this Agnipurana thing in yoga class. Is it like a health guide or something?,"Agnipurana is one amongst the 18 Purana of the Hindu literature. Its title is so  because it was narrated by Agni to Vaśistha. It consists of 16000 stanzas  distributed in 383 chapters. It has not only the compilation of special topics  from different Ayurvedic texts but also carries information regarding some  missing links, serets and some issues which are not disussed in Ayurveda. There  is deference of opinion regarding the date of this Purana. Medical information  given in Agnipurana was taken from Suśruta Samhita, Astanga Sangraha, Vrnda  Madhava and Cakradatta etc. At some places slokas were reproduced and at some  places zist has been taken. Basic principles, anatomy, physiology, medicine etc.  medical information is available in Agnipurana which is being presented in this  article.","According to 'Medical information in Agnipurana', the Agnipurana is an ancient Hindu text that was told by the god Agni to the sage Vashistha. It's a pretty big book, with 16,000 verses spread out over 383 chapters.

It's kind of like a medical textbook, with information on the basics of the human body, how it works, and how to treat illness. Some of the information in it comes from other old texts, but some of it is original, which makes it a great resource for learning about"
"Why do I look so pale all the time, could it be something to do with my blood?","According to Ayurveda the word 'Pandu' denotes pale or yellowish white colour.  Panduroga (anaemia) is a disease in which man becomes pallor due to deficiency  of Rakta dhatu (blood) in the body. Rakta dhatu is mentioned among the  Saptadhatus of the body. Historical importance of Panduroga and the comparative  study regarding its Nidana-Samprapti, Lakshanas, Upadravas and Chikitsa etc. as  found in Athavaveda, Mahabharata, Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, Chakradatta  and Basava Rajeeyam etc. are being presented in this paper.","According to 'Panduroga: a medico-historical study', Panduroga is a term from Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine, which basically means you're looking pale because you don't have enough blood in your body. It's kind of like being anemic. The paper explores how this condition has been understood and treated throughout history in various ancient texts. So, if you're looking a bit too pale, it might not just be because you're avoiding the sun, you might need to check your blood levels too."
"So, I've heard about this old belief about saving up your semen to stay healthy. Is there any truth to that?","The ancient doctrine of semen conservation has a long philosophical history in  Europe and Asia. In Sanskrit, semen is equated with sukra, the life force. As  early as 600 B.C., the Caraka Samhita taught the importance of sukra, and gave  prescriptions to augment it. In the 18th century, semen conservation theory  reentered Western medicine through Tissot's Treatise on the Diseases Produced by  Onanism. It became the basis of the degeneracy theory of all disease, and of the  masturbation hysteria of the 19th and 20th centuries.","According to 'Semen-conservation doctrine from ancient Ayurvedic to modern sexological theory', there's an old belief dating back to ancient times in Europe and Asia that suggests saving up your semen can be good for your health. The idea even popped up in Western medicine around the 18th century. It might sound weird, but it was taken pretty seriously for a while."
I've been trying to lose weight and nothing really sticks. Do you think yoga or an Ayurvedic diet might help me?,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an Ayurveda/Yoga  intervention for weight loss, using dual-diagnosis inclusion criteria,  dual-paradigm outcomes, and a semistandardized protocol with tailoring according  to the Ayurvedic constitution/imbalance profile of each participant. DESIGN: Seventeen participants enrolled in a weekly intervention for 3 months.  Outcome measurements were performed at baseline, postintervention, and 3 and 6  months follow-up. SETTING: The intervention was conducted through the University of Arizona,  Department of Family and Community Medicine from April through December 2012. SUBJECTS: Participants included 2 men and 15 women recruited from the community  of Tucson, AZ using flyers and hospital message boards. Seventeen enrolled and  12 participants provided complete follow-up data. INTERVENTION: Participants met with an Ayurvedic practitioner twice monthly (six  times) and followed semistandardized dietary guidelines with individual  tailoring to address relevant psychophysiological imbalances obstructing weight  loss and a standardized protocol of therapeutic yoga classes three times weekly  with recommended home practice of two to four additional sessions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was weight loss. Other biomedical outcomes  included body mass index, body fat percentage, waist and hip circumference,  waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure. Unique instruments were designed to  collect data on outcomes associated with the Ayurvedic medical paradigm,  including dietary changes by food qualities, mood/affect, relationships, and  changes in Ayurvedic imbalance profiles. RESULTS: Participants lost an average of 3.5 kg during the 3-month intervention.  Weight loss at 3 and 6 months postintervention increased to an average of 5.6 kg  and 5.9 kg, respectively. Participants who lost 3% of their body weight during  the 12 week intervention, lost on average an additional 3% during the follow-up  period. Psychosocial outcomes also improved. No additional services were  provided to participants during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: A whole-systems Ayurvedic medicine and Yoga therapy approach  provides a feasible promising noninvasive low-cost alternative to traditional  weight loss interventions with potential added benefits associated with  sustainable holistic lifestyle modification and positive psychosocial changes.","According to the study 'Outcomes from a Whole-Systems Ayurvedic Medicine and Yoga Therapy Treatment for Obesity Pilot Study', using Ayurvedic medicine and doing yoga could be a pretty good way to lose weight. The study had people meet with an Ayurvedic practitioner and do yoga three times a week for three months. At the end of the three months, people lost around 7.7 pounds on average, and even continued to lose more weight after the program ended. Not only did they lose weight, but they also reported improvements in their mood and relationships. So, if you're looking to shed some pounds, it might be worth giving Ayurvedic medicine and yoga a shot."
"I've got a persistent cough and some tummy troubles, are there any natural remedies or plants that might help with that?","Atharvaveda is the fourth and last Veda of Hindu literature. Its oldest name was  'ATHARVANGIRASAH', because it was contributed by two sages, ATHARVAN and ANGIRA.  It is also known as 'Bhaishajjvaveda'. Atharvaveda gives information regarding  plants, minerals and animal products with their usage for medical purposes. For  example, 'Apamarga', a plant is useful for cough, piles, itching and abdominal  pain, wherea 'Lavana' is useful for pimples; 'Shankha' useful to protect from  diseases and 'Mriga Shringa' is useful for pulmonary consumption and other  chronic diseases etc.","According to 'Atharvaveda and its materia medica', the Atharvaveda, an ancient Hindu text, talks about how different plants and minerals can be used for health benefits.

I've noticed some white patches on my skin. Could it be something like Vitiligo or leucoderma?,The earliest known reference to Kilăsa was in 2200 B.C. in the period of  Aushooryan. In 1550 B.C. information regarding Vitiligo was noted in the Ebers  Papyrus. Atharvavĕda also carries the description of the disease Kilăsa along  with several herbal prescriptions. Buddhist literature (Pĭtikăs) especially  Vinaya Pĭtika carries the description of Kilăsa. Old Testament also carries the  description of white spots i.e. in the Leviticus chapter 13. In ayurvĕda the  word Kuşţa was used for all types of skin diseases. Both Kilăsa and Switra are  mentioned together in ayurvĕda because of similarity in their aetiology. Kilăsa  is also called as Băhya (external) Kuşţa. It is classified into three types  based on three Dŏşăs. Prognosis of the disease was also described in ayurvĕda.  This disease can be compared with Vitiligo/leucoderma in modern medicine. The  Roman Physician Celsus first coined the term Vitiligo in the 2nd Century A.D.  This article carries medico-historical references of Kilăsa from ancient to  modern literature.,"According to 'Medico-historical study of ""Kilasa"" (vitiligo/leucoderma) a common skin disorder', Kilasa, also known as Vitiligo or leucoderma, is a skin condition that's been around for a really long time, since 2200 B.C. It's a skin disorder that causes white patches on your skin. The condition was even mentioned in ancient texts like Buddhist literature and the Old Testament of the Bible. So, if you know someone with Vitiligo, remember it's not a new thing and it's been studied for thousands of years."
Is it true that stuff from the ocean like shells and coral can be used in natural medicines? Can you tell me more about that?,"Natural resources such as plants, animals and minerals have always been used by  mankind to develop drugs and marine world is no exception. Marine by-products  like conches, pearls, mother of pearl shells, corals and so forth have been used  by traditional Ayurvedic practitioners for centuries. The unique methods of  these preparations are scientifically designed to eliminate unwanted impurities  and convert them into bioavailable form. In this study, Conch (Xanchus pyrum)  was used as a marine resource of calcium carbonate and was converted  pharmaceutically from its aragonite form to calcite. All the steps of  preparations and changes in the properties therein were documented and  validated. Further, traditional as well as modern analytical tools were used to  study its physical and chemical characters to develop a monograph. The physical  characterization included particle size, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning  Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Fourier  Transform Infra-red (FTIR). Metal composition and heavy metal limits were  determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry  (ICPOES). This study revealed the rearrangement of aragonite crystals into  calcite form by grinding, trituration with aloe vera juice and incineration  under controlled conditions. Moreover, the finished product was found to be  devoid of organic matrix that is nacre. This study creates a foundation for the  development of a master formula for commonly used Shankha Bhasma in Ayurvedic  medicines.","According to 'Pharmaceutical Standardization and Physicochemical Characterization of Traditional Ayurvedic Marine Drug: Incinerated Conch Shell (Shankha Bhasma)', scientists have been looking into how ancient Ayurvedic practices used things like conch shells in medicine. They found that these shells, which contain a type of natural calcium, were ground down, mixed with aloe vera juice, and then heated under special conditions to make them safe and easier for our bodies to use. This research could help improve how we use these natural resources in modern medicines."
"So, Ayurveda has been used for a long time in India, even for animals. Are there any natural Ayurvedic practices I could use to improve my overall health?","Ayurvĕda, the oldest existing medical science of India, which is not only  responsible for the health of human beings but also, plays an important in  Veterinary sciences. In India, history of traditional Veterinary medicine dates  back to the era of Mahăbhărata i.e.5000 B.C., recorded in the form of ""Nakula  Samhhită"". Hastăyurvĕda is a treatise on elephants, Palkăpya wrote this Samhită.  The present book is available as a complete Samhită, edited by Pandit Shivadutta  Sharma. Hastăyurvĕda was printed at Anandăśrama press in 1894. Hastăyurvĕda has  160 Adhyăyăs. This Samhită is based on fundamental principles of Ayurvĕda,  containing all aspects of Sharir including Anatomy & Physiology, Rog Vigyăna,  Surgery and Treatment of elephants as well as their care. It is the one and only  complete printed Samhită and rare book on Hastăyurvĕda by Palkăpya.","According to 'Hastyăyurvĕda--a complete treatise on elephants', this is an ancient Indian book all about how to take care of elephants. They used Ayurveda, a really old type of medicine from India, to help with everything from understanding an elephant's body to treating their illnesses and injuries. It's like the ultimate guide for keeping elephants healthy, and it's the only one of its kind that's ever been made into a complete printed book."
"I'm hearing a lot about Ayurvedic supplements lately. But is it true they might contain benzene, which is a carcinogen?","OBJECTIVES: Ayurvedic formulations are becoming the prior choice of people as  health care supplements. The increasing demand for these formulations has led to  extensive development of Ayurvedic pharmaceutical industries worldwide. The  reaction between the preservatives (sodium benzoates and ascorbic acid) used in  these formulations could generate benzene. Benzene is classified as class-1  human carcinogen and responsible for various short and long term health effects. METHODS: In this study, 25 formulations (containing ascorbic acid and sodium  benzoate) of various manufacturers available as over the counter products were  obtained and their benzene content were determined using gas chromatograph with  flame ionization detector. RESULTS: The result showed that 64% of the formulations were free from benzene  contamination whereas 36% of formulations were found to be contaminated with  benzene. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and validated gas  chromatographic method for estimation of benzene in Ayurvedic formulations was  also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that the level of benzene was within permissible  limits, yet the presence of a carcinogen in the marketed formulations intended  for internal use is an alarming situation.","According to 'Ayurvedic formulations containing benzoic and ascorbic acids as additives: benzene formation during storage and impact of additives on quality parameters', some over-the-counter health supplements that use Ayurvedic recipes might have benzene in them. Benzene is something scientists think could cause cancer. The study tested 25 different supplements and found that more than a third of them had some benzene, although it was not more than what's considered safe. Still, it's something to think about if you're using these types of supplements."
"So, does this mean that plants with similar tastes could have similar health benefits according to Ayurveda?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the patterns that shape  traditional medical knowledge is essential for accelerating ethnopharmacological  progress. According to Ayurveda, medicinal plants that belong to different taxa,  but which have similar taste, may display similar (ethno)pharmacological  activities (EPAs) (Bhishagratna, 1998; Sharma and Dash, 2006). AIM OF THE STUDY: To understand the patterns that govern the distribution of  herbal EPAs in Ayurveda and to evaluate the potential concordance between  chemical class or taste of the constituent phytocompounds and EPAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mixed database (PhytoMolecularTasteDB) was constructed  for Ayurvedic medicinal plants by integrating modern data (medicinal plant  composition, phytochemical taste) with traditional data (ethnopharmacological  activities of plant). PhytoMolecularTasteDB contains 431 Ayurvedic medicinal  plants, 94 EPAs, 223 chemical classes of phytocompounds and 438 herbal tastants.  Potential global or individual associations between chemical classes/taste of  the phytoconstituents and EPAs were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: There was no global statistical correlation between the various  chemical classes of phytocompounds and EPAs, although there were several  individual correlations. The results suggest the existence of a global  statistical correlation (besides several individual correlations) between the  plant ""molecular taste"" (various taste-based classes of phytocompounds) and  EPAs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that phytochemical taste may be more relevant  than chemical class for EPAs prediction.","According to 'Taste of phytocompounds: A better predictor for ethnopharmacological activities of medicinal plants than the phytochemical class?', it basically says that in Ayurveda (an ancient Indian system of medicine), the taste of a plant might be a better way to guess what medicinal effects it will have, rather than what chemicals it contains. So, if two plants taste similar, they might have similar health benefits. This could help us understand and discover more about the uses of various plants in medicine."
I've heard some buzz about traditional tribal medicine. Can you tell me more about it and how it might be beneficial for my health?,"BACKGROUND: National policy on medical pluralism in India encourages the  mainstreaming of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) systems  and the revitalization of local health traditions (LHT). In Meghalaya state in  the northeast, the main LHT is its indigenous tribal traditional medicine. This  paper presents the perceptions of tribal medicine and of AYUSH systems among  various policy actors and locates the tribal medicine of Meghalaya within the  policy on medical pluralism currently being implemented in the state, a region  that is ethnically and culturally different and predominantly inhabited by  indigenous peoples. METHODS: A stakeholder mapping exercise identified appropriate policy actors and  46 in-depth interviews were conducted with policy makers, doctors, academics,  members of healer associations and elders of the community. A further 44  interviews were conducted with 24 Khasi and 20 Garo traditional healers.  Interview data were supplemented with document analysis and observations.  Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis that incorporated  elements of grounded theory. RESULTS: In Meghalaya there is high awareness and utilization of tribal  medicine, but no visible efforts by the public sector to support or engage with  healers. The AYUSH systems in contrast had little local acceptance but promotion  of these systems has led to a substantial increase in AYUSH doctors,  particularly homeopaths, in rural areas. Policy actors outside the health  department saw an important role for tribal medicine due to its popularity,  local belief in its efficacy and its cultural resonance. The need to engage with  healers to enhance referral, training, documentation and research of tribal  medicine was made. CONCLUSIONS: The wide acceptance of tribal medicine suggests that tribal  medicine needs to be supported. The results of the study question the process of  the implementation of the 'mainstreaming AYUSH' policy for Meghalaya and  highlight the importance of contextualizing health policy within the local  culture. A potential role for Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) at  sub-national levels is also highlighted.","According to 'Is 'mainstreaming AYUSH' the right policy for Meghalaya, northeast India?', traditional tribal medicine is really popular in Meghalaya, a state in northeast India, and people believe it works well. However, the public sector isn't doing much to support or work with traditional healers. On the other hand, AYUSH systems - which include Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy - are being promoted a lot, even though they're not as widely accepted by locals. The study suggests that it could be more beneficial to focus on supporting and developing tribal medicine, which is already valued and used by the local community, rather than trying to push AYUSH systems.

I've been thinking about trying out some traditional Indian medicine stuff like Ayurveda. Is it true that they might have heavy metals in them?,"Introduction: Ayurveda and Siddha are two important components of the  traditional Indian medicine (TIM). The regulatory mechanisms have been  insufficient, and heavy metal toxicity with TIM preparations continues to be a  public health nuisance, putting integrated medicine practice in jeopardy. The  current study was undertaken to review the potential health hazards of the heavy  metal content in the TIM and formulate patient-safety recommendations for  integrative medical practice. Materials and Methods: Systematic MEDLINE searches  were performed using a combination of relevant MeSH terms and keywords, and case  report/series of Ayurveda or Siddha-induced heavy metal toxicity, published in  the previous two decades, were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the tool  by Murad et al. Results: A total of 220 cases (51 case reports and 14 case  series) were found (lead, n = 156; arsenic, n = 11; mercury, n = 47; thallium,  n = 1; gold, n = 1; combination of heavy metals, n = 4) after screening for the  inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 169 (76.8%) had a low risk of  bias, 113 (out of 135 [83.7%] analyzed) contained higher-than-permissible heavy  metal content in the drug samples, and the majority showed elevated biological  levels of the heavy metals in the body. Conclusion: The heavy metals in TIM are  often the result of adulteration or improper manufacturing and prescribing  practices, despite national and international guidelines recommending quality  standards and protocols for preparing and dispensing TIM. We thus propose  multipronged approaches and provide recommendations at various levels, including  individual, institutional, national policy decisions essential to establish  patient safety of TIM.","According to 'Heavy Metals in Indian Traditional Systems of Medicine: A Systematic Scoping Review and Recommendations for Integrative Medicine Practice', traditional Indian medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha might sometimes contain harmful heavy metals. This happens due to poor quality control during production or even deliberate tainting. These metals, which can include lead or mercury, can get into your body and cause health problems. The study emphasizes the need for better regulation and guidelines to ensure what you're taking is safe. So, if you're considering these treatments, make sure they come from a reliable source and always consult with a healthcare professional."
I heard about this person who got seriously sick from taking an Ayurveda medicine. How can I make sure that the natural remedies I'm using are safe?,"Toxic epidermolysis necrosis (TEN) or Lyell syndrome is a potentially  life-threatening immunological adverse skin disease, which mostly occurs  secondary to the intake of an offending drug. It commonly manifests as a  widespread exfoliating bullous lesion in skin and mucous membrane mimicking  superficial burns and may result in hypovolemic and/or septic shock. Authors  report an unusual case of Lyell's syndrome in a 42-year-old woman, secondary to  the intake of Ayurveda medicine 'Vajra Bhasma' (Diamond Ash) prescribed by an  Ayurveda physician for treatment of her trigeminal neuralgia. After 8th day of  continuous medication intake, she had prodromal illness and rapidly developing  exfoliative skin lesion extended over 80% of total body surface area, breathing  difficulty, dizziness and anuria. The case was successfully managed by timely  diagnosis, adequate hydration and administration of immunoglobulins. After  17 days, the skin epithelium regenerated, and she improved clinically with some  depigmented lesions at discharge, which were normalised without any sequel  during her further follow-up visits in hospital.

Is there any ancient wisdom or natural remedies from these Ayurvedic manuscripts that could help with my constant headaches?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ancient India relied on manuscripts written by  scholars for storing, transferring and retrieving the information pertaining to  culture, traditions, religion, geography and political issues. Similarly,  Ayurveda, an ancient human health care management system in India and most of  its information is available through palm-leaf manuscripts. Though each  palm-leaf can persist for a fairly long time, it suffers gradual deterioration  owing to physical, chemincal and biological factors, thus warranting  digitiation. The palm-leaf manuscripts of Ayurveda are extensively studied for  finding new drug or treatment methods to new-age diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study concerns an unpublished ancient Telugu  palm-leaf manuscript containing Ayurvedic medicine information enscripted on 33  palm-leaves. Since the palm-leaf manuscript is very old, the manual  documentation, translation, digitization and analysis of it may shed light on  hidden ayurvedic information that may be useful to the modern society. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The palm-leaf manuscript with 33 folios were manually  documented and digitized into a Telugu book followed by translation into  English. The scientific names of historical diseases, plants, animals, metals  and minerals were identified based on published sources. RESULTS: A critical scrutiny of the palm-leaf manuscript revealed 120  formulations with 164 plants for 29 different kinds of diseases such as meha and  prameha (urinary problems), eye diseases, skin diseases, respiratory diseases,  fevers, digestive disorders, jaundice, tuberculosis, cancer and so on. Plant and  animal products, metals and minerals mentioned in the said formulations were  identified and listed. CONCLUSION: Basing on our study, it is concluded that the said manuscript  contains mono-or poly-herbo-mineral formulations for the treatment of various  ailments.This information can be incorporated into and compared with available  data bases to find out the effectiveness of the drug or formulation for any  given diseases. Further validation of the formulations can be done by  phytochemical and in vivo pharmacological assays.","According to ""Enumeration of various Ayurvedic formulations listed in an ancient palm-leaf manuscript of Rayalaseema region in Andhra Pradesh state, India"", researchers found an old manuscript in India that had a bunch of Ayurvedic health remedies written on it. They translated it, and found 120 different recipes using 164 plants that can supposedly treat 29 different health problems, including urinary issues, skin and eye diseases, respiratory issues, fevers, digestive problems, jaundice, tuberculosis, and even cancer. Now, they can compare these ancient remedies to modern ones to see if they're effective. This could be a cool way to discover new treatments or medications."
Who were the first people to perform surgeries and how did they learn to do it?,"Surgery and Medicine are inseparably fused today as essential parts of the art  of heeling. Over the millennia of recorded history, Medicine and Surgery have  followed separate and largely independent evolutionary pertains. It is obvious  that medical care could not have been complete without some surgery in ancient  times. This branch of medical skill was not accepted as profession. The  practitioners were members of all low caste, who were illiterates and passed on  their knowledge by oral tradition rather than in writing. The barbers are  celebrity surgeons in ancient India and continued till the recent past it is  evident by Pandyan inscriptions of Tamilnadu of 7th-8th centuries A.D. The  barbers were also the surgeons in ancient and medieval Europe. śuśrta, a great  ancient Indian Surgeon, who is regarded as father of the surgery, designed  surgical equipment with innovative vision and described many surgical  procedures, which laid basis for many advanced technologies in this field.","According to 'Evolution of surgery--śuśrta's innovative skills', surgery has been around for a long time, even in ancient times. Back then, it wasn't really seen as a profession like it is today. Instead, the people who did surgeries were often from lower social classes, including barbers. This might sound weird, but in places like India and Europe, your barber might have also been the local surgeon! There was this really awesome surgeon in ancient India named śuśrta, who is often called the 'father of surgery'. He came up with a lot of surgical procedures and tools that are still used today."
"So, like, how did people treat wounds way back in the day before modern medicine?","The response of living tissues to injury forms the foundation of all surgical  practices. Indeed, from the historical point of view, tissue injury or Vrana or  wound and its sequelae have participated in cure of most of the general medical  problems from the days of Susruta till date. The earlier medical literatures  extensively considered wound care as based on instinctive remedies but on the  other hand, the present concepts cogitate healing of wound based on visual  observations. Basic perception of wound healing only in its interpretation,  which has varied from civilization to civilization. There are various methods  for treating of wounds and have since been passed over by ancient humans to  today's modern surgeons. Therefore, it is very essential to know the historical  aspects of Vrana and its Ropana since the beginning of the tear of medicine as  compare to wound and it's healing from the modern point of view. On the basis of  above said facts an attempt has been made to explore the historical background  of and healing in present paper.","According to 'Historical survey of wound healing', the way we treat injuries has changed a lot throughout history. Back in the day, people used to rely on simple remedies and what they could see with their eyes to help wounds heal. But today, thanks to years of knowledge passed down from generation to generation and advancements in medicine, doctors have more sophisticated methods for treating wounds. This research dives into the history of wound care, as understanding the past can help us appreciate and improve modern practices."
Who's this Dhanwantari dude and why is he such a big deal in Ayurveda?,"The original conception of Ayurveda in its entirety is essentially linked to  Dhanwantari who is considered as God of Hindu Medicine. Dhanwantari is  considered a mythical deity born with ambrosia in one hand and Ayurveda on the  other at the end of the churning of milk ocean. He reincarnated himself in the  Chandra dynasty. He was born to King Dhanwa, learnt Ayurveda from Bharadwaja.  His great grandson Divodasa was also known as Dhanwantari, but was specialised  only in surgical branch of Ayurveda. Sushruta, is said to have learnt the art of  science of surgery from Divodasa Dhanwantara.","According to 'Dhanwantari: the God of Hindu medicine', Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine from India, is believed to have been given to mankind by Dhanwantari, who is considered the God of Hindu Medicine. He was said to have been born with the knowledge of Ayurveda. His great-grandson, also named Dhanwantari, specialized in surgery and taught it to a man named Sushruta. So, in a way, you can think of Dhanwantari as the OG doctor who passed down his medical wisdom through generations."
I've heard about Ayurveda but don't know much about it. Could it offer a different approach to staying healthy compared to regular medicine?,"Ayurveda, the oldest health care system in the world, has unique potential  waiting to be exploited by the advanced practice nurse (APN) practicing in  family health and primary care settings. The background, paradigm,  interventions, scientific research, and strategies to implement Ayurveda in APN  practice are explored. Although little is known about Ayurveda in Western  cultures, it offers many health promotive interventions that can help the APN  fulfill the needs of families who seek a level of wellness not offered by  conventional medicine.","According to 'Providing alternative health care: an ancient system for a modern age', Ayurveda is the world's oldest health care system and it could be really beneficial for modern nurses to learn about it. Even though it's not very well-known in Western countries, Ayurveda has a lot of strategies and treatments that can promote good health. This can be especially helpful for patients who feel like typical medicine isn't fully meeting their health needs."
"Has alternative medicine always been a thing, or is it just popular now?","The author, in an attempt to clarify whether the rise of alternative medicine is  a phenomenon characteristic of our time or whether it existed in the past as  well, has identified at least three alternative medicines, which developed in  ancient Rome, ancient India and in the medieval Islamic world. The circumstances  leading to the development of alternative medicine in the past and in our time  are discussed and compared.","According to 'Alternative medicine in ancient and medieval history', the use of alternative medicine isn't just a trend of our times. It's been around for ages, with examples seen in ancient Rome, India, and the medieval Islamic world. The situations that led to these forms of medicine popping up in the past are pretty similar to why they're becoming popular now."
"Do the Ayurvedic medicines I'm taking have any harmful stuff in them, like PAHs or something?","Ayurvedic medicinal preparations, commonly known as bhasmas, were analysed for  the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). All the  preparations contained PAH. The level of total PAH varied widely (2.32-9.55 ppm)  among the preparations tested. Similarly, the benzo(a)pyrene level also varied  the highest concentration being 9.7 ppm.","According to 'Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in traditional medicinal preparations', there are these things called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - let's just call them PAHs - in Ayurvedic medicines, also known as bhasmas. The amount of these PAHs can vary a lot in different bhasmas. They also found something called benzo(a)pyrene in there, its amount can also change depending on the bhasma. Basically, the stuff they found in the medicine isn't always the same - it changes based on which one you're taking."
I've heard that traditional Chinese medicine can be good for you. What kind of health benefits could I get from it?,"Author information: (1)School of Basic Medical Science, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese  Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China.","According to 'Textual research on relationship between traditional Chinese medicine and medical prescriptions in the Sanskrit formulary Bower Manuscript excavated in Xinjiang', ancient Chinese medicine and old medical scripts found in a document called the Bower Manuscript, which was discovered in Xinjiang, have a lot in common. This suggests that traditional Chinese medicine might have been influenced by or shared ideas with other ancient medical practices."
"So there's this thing called Ayurvedic psychiatry in India, right? Does it mix modern and traditional methods to help with mental health?","In this paper, the author traces two parallel movements of institutionalized  Ayurvedic psychiatry, an emergent field of specialization in Kerala, India: the  'work of purification' and the 'work of translation' that Latour has described  as characteristic of the 'modern constitution.' The author delineates these  processes in terms of the relationship of Ayurvedic psychiatry to (1) allopathic  psychiatry, (2) bhutavidya, a branch of textual Ayurveda dealing with spirits,  and (3) occult violence. The aim is to offer a model of these open and hidden  processes and of Ayurvedic psychiatry's positioning within a hierarchical mental  health field characterized simultaneously by biopsychiatric hegemony and a  persistent vernacular healing tradition. Through these processes, Ayurvedic  psychiatry emerges as a relevant actor. It demarcates itself from both  allopathic and vernacular epistemologies and ontologies while simultaneously  drawing upon aspects of each, and, in this way, shows itself to be both deeply  modern and highly pragmatic.","According to 'Translation and purification: Ayurvedic psychiatry, allopathic psychiatry, spirits and occult violence in Kerala, South India', Ayurvedic psychiatry is becoming a big thing in Kerala, India. This kind of psychiatry is rooted in traditional Indian medicine and is now finding its place in the world of mental health. What's interesting is that it's making its own way, not just copying Western psychiatry methods or sticking strictly to old-school Ayurvedic techniques. It's like they're creating a cool mix of both to create a unique approach to mental health, blending modern and traditional methods."
"I've been hearing about Ayurveda recently. Can it really help with things like knee pain and if so, how reliable is the diagnosis process?","Background: Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine. The customized  Ayurvedic approach consists of a combination of several diagnostic procedures  and subsequent individualized therapeutic interventions. Evaluation of  inter-rater reliability (IRR) of Ayurvedic diagnoses has rarely been performed.  The aim of this study was to evaluate IRR of Ayurvedic diagnosis for patients  with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A diagnostic reliability study of 30 patients  and 4 Ayurvedic experts was nested in a randomized controlled trial. Patients  were diagnosed in a sequential order by all experts utilizing a semistructured  patient history form. A nominal group technique as consensus procedure was  performed to reach agreement on the items to be diagnosed. An IRR analysis using  Fleiss' and Cohen's kappa statistics was performed to determine a  chance-corrected measure of agreement among raters. Results: One hundred and  twenty different ratings and 30 consensus ratings were performed and analyzed.  While high percentages of agreement for main diagnostic entities and the final  Ayurveda diagnosis (95% consensus agreement on main diagnosis) could be  observed, this was not reflected in the corresponding kappa values, which  largely yielded fair-to-poor inter-rater agreement kappas for central diagnostic  aspects such as prakriti and agni (κ values between 0 and 0.4). Notably,  agreement on disease-related entities was better than that on constitutional  entities. Conclusions: This is the first diagnostic study embedded in a clinical  trial on patients with knee osteoarthritis utilizing a multimodality whole  systems approach. Results showed a contrast between the high agreement of the  consented final diagnosis and disagreement on certain diagnostic details. Future  diagnostic studies should have larger sample sizes and a methodology more  tailored to the specificities of traditional whole systems of medicine. Equal  emphasis will need to be placed on all core diagnostic components of Ayurveda,  both constitutional and disease specific, using detailed structured history  taking forms.","According to 'Reliability of Ayurvedic Diagnosis for Knee Osteoarthritis Patients: A Nested Diagnostic Study Within a Randomized Controlled Trial', Ayurveda, which is an ancient Indian medical practice, was used to diagnose knee arthritis in a group of patients. When four Ayurvedic experts looked at the same patients, they often agreed on the final diagnosis, but they didn't always agree on the smaller details of their diagnoses. This means that while they all agreed that a patient had knee arthritis, they sometimes disagreed on the specifics of the patient's health and body type according to Ayurvedic principles. The study suggests that in the future, researchers need to focus on the smaller details and use larger sample sizes when using Ayurveda to"
"I've been feeling really off lately and I'm not sure why. Could it be something like what this Ayurvedic medicine thing is talking about, like an imbalance in my body's metabolic principles?","OBJECTIVE: This is a preliminary report on the development of a scale to measure  the symptoms of unmāda (psychosis) attributable to tridosa (metabolic  principles) by using the concepts of Ayurvedic medicine. DESIGN: The 67-item unmāda specific symptom scale was developed on the basis of  translation of Sanskrit verses describing vātaja (V), pittaja (P), and kaphaja  (K) unmāda (specific symptoms of psychosis due to the imbalances of metabolic  components) and by taking the opinions of experts (15 Ayurveda experts, 5  psychiatrists, and 5 psychologists). SETTINGS: The setting for this study was Spandana Psychiatric Nursing Home  Bangalore, India. SUBJECTS: The scale was administered by an unblinded assessor to 30 consecutive  patients with nonaffective psychotic disorders. RESULTS: The unmāda specific symptom scale was associated with excellent  internal consistency. The Cronbach's alpha for V, P, and K scales were 0.98,  0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The split-half reliability for V, P, and K scales  were 0.97, 0.97, and 0.88 respectively. Scores on vātaja, pittaja, and kaphaja  scales were inversely correlated, suggesting that they are mutually exclusive.  The three subgroups of psychoses--paranoid schizophrenia, schizophrenia  (unspecified), and unspecified nonorganic psychosis--had significantly different  loadings on the three scores, having high scores on vātaja, pittaja, and  kaphaja, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The tridoshas in psychotic disorders can be measured reliably by  this instrument. The scores on each of these doşas help in differentiating three  types of psychosis (according to Ayurveda) that have good correspondence with  prevailing classification. However, this scale must also be applied to the other  28 separate subcategories of the psychoses that are identified in the  International Statistical Classifications of Diseases (version 10) and to the 10  variants of psychosis as defined by the American Psychiatric Association  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-R to help better understand the true  utility for use here with the various subcategories of schizophrenia.","According to ""Measuring the tridosha symptoms of unmāda (psychosis): a preliminary study"", researchers in India have come up with a new way to understand and measure symptoms of severe mental disorders like psychosis, using principles from traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda. They focused on three elements, known as vātaja, pittaja, and kaphaja, which are like metabolic components in our body. The study showed that these elements can be used to differentiate between different types of psychosis. This could be a cool new approach to better diagnose and understand these disorders. However, they need to test it further on more types of mental conditions to see if it's really useful."
I'm trying to get in shape but don't want to overdo it. What kind of exercise routine would be best for my health?,"When considering the history of exercise physiology, authors begin with  Hippocrates and the ""Golden Age"" of Greece before mentioning Galen and the  contributions from Rome. However, this approach has omitted the information from  the ancient civilizations of India which flourished before and during the  emergence of Mycenaen cultures. Specifically ignored have been 1) the tridosa  doctrine (humoral theory), which as early as 1500 B.C., emphasized that disease  occurred because of a displacement of one or more of the three humors, with  health being achieved when the humors were in equilibrium and 2) the perspective  of Susruta (Sushruta) who was a 600 B.C. physician who included exercise in his  prescriptions to prevent and treat diseases. Susruta not only advocated exercise  to maintain equilibrium among the humors, notably kapha, he promoted exercise to  minimize the consequences of obesity and diabetes. To be effective, exercise had  to be daily and moderate in intensity and never excessive or to exceed the  half-maximum limit for exhaustion, because disease or even death could ensue. It  is concluded that Susruta's concepts pertaining to chronic exercise and to the  health benefits of exercise were ""remarkably modern"" and that future authors on  the history of exercise physiology should include contributions from ancient  India.","According to 'Susruta of India, an unrecognized contributor to the history of exercise physiology', the idea of exercise for health isn't as new as we think. An ancient Indian doctor named Susruta recommended daily, moderate exercise way back in 600 B.C. to stay healthy and fight off diseases like obesity and diabetes. He believed too much or too intense exercise could actually cause harm, so balance was key. His ideas are pretty similar to what fitness experts advise today. So, next time you hit the gym, remember you're following a wellness tradition that's been around for over 2,000 years!"
Does the Vămana Purăna mention any natural remedies or medicinal plants that could help with common health problems?,"Purăna and Itihăsa (history) have been the allied subjects since the early Vĕdik  times. They have been regarded as supplementary to each other. The word 'Purăna'  as an adjective means ancient or old. Its earliest use as a noun in the sense of  'ancient lore or old narrative' (or works containing ancient lore's or old  narratives) is found in the Atharvavĕda and the Brăhmanas. This Vămana Purăna  contains information on medicinal plants which are used in ăyurvĕda for treating  different kinds of ailments. This article carries the list of medicinal plants  referred in Vămana Purăna with their scientific names, context and references.","According to 'Medicinal plants referred in Vămana Purăna', this ancient text, called the Vămana Purăna, talks about old-school remedies for different health problems using certain plants.

So if you're into natural remedies, you might find it pretty interesting."
"I've heard about this ancient ""immortal"" food-elixir Soma from Hindu mythology. Is there a modern equivalent or recipe that I could try for general health benefits?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Food is medicine and vice versa. In Hindu and  Ayurvedic medicine, and among human cultures of the Indian subcontinent in  general, the perception of the food-medicine continuum is especially well  established. The preparation of the exhilarating, gold-coloured Soma, Amrita or  Ambrosia, the elixir and food of the 'immortals'-the Hindu pantheon-by the  ancient Indo-Aryans, is described in the Rigveda in poetic hymns. Different  theories regarding the botanical identity of Soma circulate, but no  pharmacologically and historically convincing theory exists to date. We intend  to contribute to the botanical, chemical and pharmacological characterisation of  Soma through an analysis of two historical Amrita recipes recorded in the Bower  Manuscript. The recipes are referred therein as panaceas (clarified butter) and  also as a medicine to treat nervous diseases (oil), while no exhilarating  properties are mentioned. Notwithstanding this, we hypothesise, that these  recipes are related to the ca. 1800 years older Rigvedic Soma. We suppose that  the psychoactive Soma ingredient(s) are among the components, possibly in  smaller proportions, of the Amrita recipes preserved in the Bower Manuscript. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Bower Manuscript is a medical treatise recorded in  the 6th century A.D. in Sanskrit on birch bark leaves, probably by Buddhist  monks, and unearthed towards the end of the 19th century in Chinese Turkestan.  We analysed two Amrita recipes from the Bower Manuscript, which was translated  by Rudolf Hoernle into English during the early 20th century. A database search  with the updated Latin binomials of the herbal ingredients was used to gather  quantitative phytochemical and pharmacological information. RESULTS: Together, both Amrita recipes contain around 100 herbal ingredients.  Psychoactive alkaloid containing species still important in Ayurvedic, Chinese  and Thai medicine and mentioned in the recipe for 'Amrita-Prâsa clarified  butter' and 'Amrita Oil' are: Tinospora cordifolia (Amrita, Guduchi), three Sida  spp., Mucuna pruriens, Nelumbo nucifera, Desmodium gangeticum, and  Tabernaemontana divaricata. These species contain several notorious and  potential psychoactive and psychedelic alkaloids, namely: tryptamines,  2-phenylethylamine, ephedrine, aporphines, ibogaine, and L-DOPA. Furthermore,  protoberberine alkaloids, tetrahydro-β-carbolines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines  with monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I) activity but also neurotoxic properties  are reported. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that Soma was a combination of a protoberberine  alkaloids containing Tinospora cordifolia juice with MAO-I properties mixed  together with a tryptamine rich Desmodium gangeticum extract or a blending of  Tinospora cordifolia with an ephedrine and phenylethylamine-rich Sida spp.  extract. Tinospora cordifolia combined with Desmodium gangeticum might provide a  psychedelic experience with visual effects, while a combination of Tinospora  cordifolia with Sida spp. might lead to more euphoric and amphetamine-like  experiences.","According to 'Soma, food of the immortals according to the Bower Manuscript (Kashmir, 6th century A.D.)', ancient Indian recipes for a special kind of food or drink called Soma, thought to be the food of the gods, might have actually had some ingredients that could mess with your mind a bit, like a natural high. The researchers looked at two old recipes from a 6th century text and found that they had around 100 different plant ingredients. Some of these plants are known to contain stuff that can affect your brain and mood. They think the original Soma might have been a mix of these plants, giving different effects depending on the combo - some might have been more like a halluc"
"I've been hearing a lot about these traditional Indian medicines, AYUSH. What are they all about and why are people using them over regular medicine?","Background Albeit Indian system of medicine has been practised since long  however it has got recent prominence after some policy decisions made to make it  more accessible to the people of India. Methods A two fold search strategy was  adopted to obtain the literature; search through PUBMED and hand search through  cross references. Of the 58 articles obtained through both the search approaches  13 articles were finally included in the review. Results The studies reviewed  assessed the utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people  adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. Utilization was  observed in a particular geographical area (states) and by a specific group of  people such as tribal and general population, medical practitioners and  religious groups. Perception about AYUSH system was mixed with different  segments of the society. Preference among the general population revolved around  distrust or frustration with allopathic medicine, cost effectiveness,  accessibility, non-availability of other options and less side effects of AYUSH  medicines. Moreover people primarily adopted AYUSH systems of medicine based on  their personal experiences and recommended the same to other people as well.  Conclusions A mixed response was observed through this systematic review with  regard to utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people  adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. A higher level of  awareness and governmental patronization is required to make it available to the  common man at the last corner of the society for the benefit of the former and  the system as well.","According to 'Utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India: a systematic review', traditional Indian medicine is gaining popularity. This could be because people are frustrated with regular medicine, they find traditional medicine cheaper, it's easily accessible, or they don't have other options. Another big reason is that traditional medicine tends to have fewer side effects. The results are mixed, though, and different regions and groups in India use and view it differently. The paper suggests the Indian government needs to do more to make sure everyone knows about and can access traditional medicine."
"I've heard about this AYUSH thing, which is a mix of Ayurveda, Yoga and other traditional stuff. Is it really effective and how can I learn more about it?","For the first time, we have a comprehensive database on usage of AYUSH (acronym  for Ayurveda, naturopathy and Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) in India at  the household level. This article aims at exploring the spread of the  traditional medical systems in India and the perceptions of people on the access  and effectiveness of these medical systems using this database. The article uses  the unit level data purchased from the National Sample Survey Organization, New  Delhi. Household is the basic unit of survey and the data are the collective  opinion of the household. This survey shows that less than 30% of Indian  households use the traditional medical systems. There is also a regional pattern  in the usage of particular type of traditional medicine, reflecting the regional  aspects of the development of such medical systems. The strong faith in AYUSH is  the main reason for its usage; lack of need for AYUSH and lack of awareness  about AYUSH are the main reasons for not using it. With regard to source of  medicines in the traditional medical systems, home is the main source in the  Indian medical system and private sector is the main source in Homeopathy. This  shows that there is need for creating awareness and improving access to  traditional medical systems in India. By and large, the users of AYUSH are also  convinced about the effectiveness of these traditional medicines.","According to 'Spread of Traditional Medicines in India: Results of National Sample Survey Organization's Perception Survey on Use of AYUSH', there's a new database that looks at how Indian households use traditional medicines and therapies like Ayurveda, naturopathy, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The study found that less than a third of Indian households use these traditional methods. The reasons why people turn to them are mostly due to strong faith in their effectiveness. On the flip side, the main reasons people don't use them are because they don't feel the need or they're not aware of them. Most people get their traditional medicines from home or private businesses, especially for homeopathy. The takeaway is that there's"
"So like, what's the deal with traditional medicine like ayurveda and yunani in India? How has it changed and been shaped over time?","This is a study of the emergence of new institutional arenas for ayurveda and  yunani medicine, collectivized at the time as 'indigenous medicine,' in a  semi-autonomous State (Mysore) in late colonial India. The study argues that the  characteristic dimensions of this process were compromise and misalignment  between ideals of governance and modes of pedagogy and practice. Running counter  to a narrative that the Princely States such as Mysore were instrumental for the  'preservation' of ayurveda, this study analyzes the process of negotiation and  struggle between a variety of actors engaged with shaping the direction of  institutionalized 'indigenous medicine'. In examining the entanglements over the  priorities of the state administration and the conflicting desires and ideals of  protagonists, the study problematizes the idea of studying the encounter between  the 'state' and 'indigenous medicine,' in order rather to highlight their  co-production and the tensions which were generated in the process. While  institution-making for ayurveda and yunani in Mysore State assumed distinctive  translocal forms, themes of divergence that were unresolved during the time of  this study, over the role of the state, the politics of validation, appropriate  curricula and pedagogy, and their relation to practice and employment, continue  to inform the trajectories of state-directed health provision through  'indigenous medicine' on larger scales [India, health-care, ayurveda, yunani,  education].","According to the research in 'Compromised: making institutions and indigenous medicine in Mysore State, circa 1908-1940', traditional Indian medicine, like Ayurveda and Yunani, wasn't just preserved by local governments in colonial India. Instead, it had to adapt and compromise to fit into new institutions and policies. This process wasn't always smooth and there were disagreements about things like teaching methods, validation, and the role of the government. This early conflict has actually shaped how these traditional medicines are used and taught in India today."
I've been dealing with some uncomfortable butt stuff recently. Could it be hemorrhoids and what could be causing it?,"The disease Arśas (hemorrhoids), an ano-rectal disorder is as old as mankind.  Suśrta farther of surgery described the Arśas under heading of 'Mahagadas'  (eight major diseases). Due to inconsistency of human diet and social  obligations, a large proportion of the population is suffering from hemorrhoids.  As per Ayurveda, the etiological factors are broadly classified as Sămănya  (Non-specific) and Viśĕsa (Specific). Viśĕsa again sub divided in to Sahaja and  Janmottara. Suśrta classified this disease on the basis of clinical  manifestations in to six types, where as Caraka and Văgbhata classified in to  two according to discharging nature and causative factors respectively.","According to 'A literary review of Arśas (haemorrhoids)', hemorrhoids are a common problem that have been around since humans have. They're often caused by our diet and lifestyle choices. The study breaks down the causes into two categories: general ones that can apply to anyone, and specific ones that depend on the individual. They also mention that there are six different types of hemorrhoids based on their symptoms, but others believe there are only two types, based on what causes them and whether or not they bleed."
"I've heard about this Ayurveda stuff, is there a way I can use it along with modern medicine to feel better?","The validity of herbometallic bhasmas described in Ayurveda is nowhere  acknowledged by biomedical science. To unravel the knowledge of bhasmas, an  algorithm integrating ayurveda- and science-based experiments needs to connect  the basic science of rasa shastra, the study of herbometallic medicines in  ayurveda, to clinical data.","According to 'Elucidating the nanomaterialistic basis for ayurvedic bhasmas using physicochemical experimentation', the benefits of Ayurvedic bhasmas - a type of traditional Indian medicine often made from herbs and metals - aren't widely recognized by modern medical science. However, a new approach combining Ayurvedic practices and scientific experiments could help us understand how these medicines work. This could lead to them being more widely used and accepted in the future."
"My friend and I have been trying to get pregnant for a while with no luck. Are there any natural or alternative methods we could try, like Ayurveda or something?","BACKGROUND: Treatment of female infertility has been growing globally in recent  years. In spite of improvements in medical strategies and the improved outcomes  for infertile couples, treatment attempts remain largely unsuccessful. A growing  number of patients pursue complementary and alternative medicine treatment  options like Ayurveda that offers a variety of inpatient and outpatient  treatments for infertility. CASE REPORT: A case of a 38 year-old woman with infertility of unknown origin is  presented. She received 18 conventional fertility treatments in 5 different  fertility centers and 3 different countries. After several complications, the  patient quitted conventional treatment and admitted to an Ayurvedic outpatient  clinic where she received a complex Ayurvedic treatment, which included  botanicals, dietary and lifestyle advice, manual therapy, yoga, and spiritual  elements. The patient then became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy boy in  2012. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurveda may be a useful complementary option in the case of futile  conventional treatment attempts in female infertility. Nevertheless, the  evidence base for Ayurvedic interventions remains weak and requires  well-designed clinical trials. This case raises some questions, such as whether  the exposure to a large number of assisted reproduction procedures can lead to  more health problems than health benefits. The Ayurvedic approach to fertility  strives first to improve the health of the patient leading to a higher  likelihood of pregnancy. As this is a case report, we are not able to exclude  temporal factors stimulating the pregnancy. However, the chronology suggests  that this approach might have been an important factor in the eventual  pregnancy.","According to 'The Effect of a Complex Multi-modality Ayurvedic Treatment in a Case of Unknown Female Infertility', sometimes the usual medical treatments for infertility don't always work, as was the case for one 38-year-old woman. After trying loads of different treatments and not having any luck, she decided to try something different and turned to Ayurveda, a type of alternative medicine. This included things like herbal treatments, changes to her diet and lifestyle, yoga, and spiritual guidance. After following this new routine, she was able to get pregnant and had a healthy baby boy. This doesn't mean Ayurveda is the magic solution for everyone struggling with infertility, and there needs to be more research into its effectiveness. But it does show"
"So, there's this book called Madhava Nidana which talks about diseases and stuff. Can it help me understand why I keep getting headaches?","Mădhavakara, the author of renowned work on 'Nidăna-Rŏgaviniścaya', popularly  known as Mădhava Nidăna. It may be the first or earliest compendium detailed  description of the diseases based on Nidăna Pancăkam (Five groups of subjects  concerned to aetio-pathogenesis). He was the son of Indukara according to the  colophon of a manuscript of Văcaspati's commentary on Mădhava Nidăna. He is  probably lived between 700-800 A.D., because he is quoted by Vrnda, who belongs  to 8th century A.D. The book Mădhava Nidăna was translated in to Arabic as  evidenced by the writings of Ali Ibn Sahl 849-850 A.D. and other Arabic authors.  Hence, he probably lived between 700-800 A.D. Madhava Nidana is a popular work  on Nidăna (aetiopathogenesis) and it is the best in the field of ayurvĕda.  ""Nidăne Mădhavam srestah"" and it is popularly known by the name of the author,  but the title of the work is ""Rugviniscaya"" or ""Rŏgaviniscăya"". The subject  matter explained in 73 chapters. The 1st chapter deals with Nidănapancakam and  the other chapter's deals with diseases. The major contribution of Mădhava is  the new order of arranging diseases, description of new diseases and recognizing  some disorders as independent diseases. The other works attributed to Mădhava  are Mădhavacikitsă, Paryăyaratnamăla etc. The important commentaries on  Madhavanidana are ""Madhukŏśa"" by Vijayarakşita and Srĭkaņţhadatta and  ""Atankadarpana"" by Vidyavăcaspati. The work is translated into English, Italian,  Hindi, Bengali, Telugu etc., including some regional languages of India.","According to 'Biography of Mădhavakara: his scholarly contribution', Mădhavakara was an important figure in medical history who lived around the 700-800 A.D. He wrote a famous book called 'Mădhava Nidăna'. This book was one of the first that went into detail about the causes and development of diseases. Mădhavakara was known for organizing diseases in a new way, describing new diseases, and identifying certain health issues as standalone diseases. His work was so influential that it was translated into Arabic back in the day and into various other languages including English and Italian in more recent times. He also wrote other works that have been commented on and studied by scholars over time"
"I've heard about this plant called Nux vomica being used in Ayurvedic medicine, but isn't it poisonous? How is it made safe to use?","Strychnos nux vomica Linn.(Loganaceae) commonly known as Nux vomica (Kupeelu),  is a poisonous plant and its seeds are used widely in Ayurvedic system of  medicine since time immemorial. Ayurveda advocates that nux vomica seeds are to  be administered in therapeutics only after going through certain purificatory  measures (Shodhana). There are more than six media: cow's urine (Go mutra),  cow's milk (Go dugdha), cow's ghee (Go ghrita), Kanji (thin gruel), castor oil  (Eranda taila) and fresh ginger juice (Ardraka swarasa) etc., which have been  reported in different classical texts of Ayurveda for proper processing of nux  vomica seeds. In this study, an attempt has been made to purify the seeds by  using three different methods as described in ancient treatise by using cow's  urine and cow's milk as media alone and together. This study revealed that all  the methods studied reduced the toxicity of strychnine and brucine contents in  comparison to the raw seeds as determined by HPTLC. Out of these three methods  maximum reduction in strychnine and brucine contents was found when the seeds  were purified by keeping them in cow's urine for seven days followed by boiling  in cow's milk for three hrs.","According to 'Effect of purificatory measures through cow's urine and milk on strychnine and brucine content of Kupeelu (Strychnos nuxvomica Linn.) seeds', the seeds of the Nux vomica plant, which are usually poisonous, can be made safer to use in Ayurvedic medicine through a specific cleansing process. This involves soaking them in cow's urine for a week and then boiling them in cow's milk for three hours. This process reduces the harmful elements in the seeds, making them safer for therapeutic use."
I've been struggling with my weight and I heard about this Ayurveda thing. Can it really help me manage my weight and health without breaking the bank?,"Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are increasing to epidemic  proportions globally. There are 400 million clinically obese adults worldwide  and there are more than 220 million people who have diabetes. The global impact  of these disorders is immense in terms of human suffering and economic burden.  There is an urgent need for a more effective understanding of these disease  processes and their management, including the use of natural strategies that are  affordable and efficacious. The health care system known as Ayurveda has much to  offer in this regard. Ayurveda describes a set of complex clinical disorders,  collectively called Prameha, that are characterized by frequent abnormal  micturition. The clinical conditions associated with Prameha correlate in many  ways with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. The etiology,  classification, pathogenesis, and management of Prameha are discussed at length  and in detail in the Ayurvedic texts. The theoretical background and  comprehensive set of strategies Ayurveda utilizes to treat Prameha may be  valuable in managing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus in an  efficacious and cost-effective manner.","According to 'Ayurvedic concept of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus', there is a massive global issue with obesity and diabetes. Ayurveda, an ancient health care system, might have some answers. It talks about a group of conditions, called Prameha, that have a lot in common with obesity and diabetes. Understanding and using Ayurvedic strategies could potentially provide a cheaper and effective way to manage these health issues."
What is JWARA mentioned in Ayurveda and how can it affect my health?,"""JWARA"" is important and critical among all the diseases, because it affects  each and every living being. Hence, it has been given first place in the  classical texts of Ayurveda. Atharvaveda (AV) has also referred Jwara with the  name Takman (son of God Varuna) and drugs like Kustha, Jangida and Anjana have  been prescribed for its management. References with regard to Jwara are also  found in other non-medical literature Viz., Mahābhārata, Purānas etc. Acārya  Suśruta has mentioned that, man comes to this world with Jwara and departs with  it. Jwara affects the whole body, the organs of senses and also the mind.  According to mythology, Jwara was originated from the hot and destructive breath  of Lord Siva, which was produced from his nostrils during the paroxysms of grief  and rage on the death of his wife, Durga. It attacks all persons of all ages and  in all conditions. Jwara is the king of all diseases, destroyer of all creatures  and severe hence a physician should be practically cautious in treating it. All  these medico-historical aspects of Jwara have been presented in this article.","According to 'JWARA (fever)- a medico historical perspective', every living being, regardless of age or health condition, gets affected by a condition called Jwara. This term is a way the old Ayurvedic texts describe fever, even saying it's the most significant of all diseases. Some old stories say Jwara came from a god's hot, angry breath. So, just like a fever can make you feel hot and miserable, it's seen as a destructive force in these old texts. The paper also mentions that there were specific remedies recommended for treating Jwara. It's a reminder that being careful and thoughtful in treating fever is important because it can affect your whole body and even your mind."
I've been hearing a lot about alternative medicine practices like Yoga and Ayurveda. Is it common to combine these with regular medical treatments in India?,"The government of India has, over the past decade, implemented the ""integration""  of traditional, complementary and alternative medical (TCAM) practitioners,  specifically practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha,  Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy (collectively known by the acronym AYUSH), in  government health services. A range of operational and ethical challenges has  manifested during this process of large health system reform. We explored the  practices and perceptions of health system actors, in relation to AYUSH  providers' roles in government health services in three Indian states - Kerala,  Meghalaya, and Delhi. Research methods included 196 in-depth interviews with a  range of health policy and system actors and beneficiaries, between February and  October 2012, and review of national, state, and district-level policy documents  relating to AYUSH integration. The thematic 'framework' approach was applied to  analyze data from the interviews, and systematic content analysis performed on  policy documents. We found that the roles of AYUSH providers are frequently  ambiguously stated and variably interpreted, in relation to various aspects of  their practice, such as outpatient care, prescribing rights, emergency duties,  obstetric services, night duties, and referrals across systems of medicine. Work  sharing is variously interpreted by different health system actors as  complementing allopathic practice with AYUSH practice, or allopathic practice,  by AYUSH providers to supplement the work of allopathic practitioners.  Interactions among AYUSH practitioners and their health system colleagues  frequently take place in a context of partial information, preconceived notions,  power imbalances, and mistrust. In some notable instances, collegial  relationships and apt divisions of responsibilities are observed. Widespread  normative ambivalence around the roles of AYUSH providers, complicated by the  logistical constraints prevalent in poorly resourced systems, has the potential  to undermine the therapeutic practices and motivation of AYUSH providers, as  well as the overall efficiency and performance of integrated health services.","According to ""Getting the water-carrier to light the lamps"": Discrepant role perceptions of traditional, complementary, and alternative medical practitioners in government health facilities in India,"" the Indian government is trying to mix traditional and alternative medicine practices, like Yoga and Ayurveda, into its healthcare system. However, the roles of these practitioners aren't always clear, which can lead to confusion and mistrust among doctors and patients. For example, some people aren't sure if these practitioners should be able to prescribe medication, handle emergencies, or refer patients to other doctors. Despite these challenges, there are some cases where the integration is working well. But overall, the lack of clarity about their roles could weaken the motivation of these practitioners and the effectiveness of the"
I'm not sure what kind of doctor I should see for women's health issues. Can a gynecologist help with that?,"Author information: (1)Krankenhaus Rotthalmünster, Abteilung für Gynäkologie, AyurSan-Klinik,  Rotthalmünster, Deutschland.","According to 'Integrative management using Ayurvedic medicine in a patient with advanced malignant mixed Muellerian tumor - a case report', Ayurvedic medicine (a type of traditional Indian healing method) was used to help manage a serious type of cancer. So, it's like using old-school healing practices to help treat modern health problems."
I've heard about Ayurvedic medicine a lot lately. Can it really help with my health issues and is it safe to use?,"Four thousand years ago, the medical knowledge of the Indian subcontinent was  codified into a system called the Ayurveda. Ayurveda remains a vital system of  medicine and drug therapy in India and elsewhere. Plant alkaloids are the  primary active ingredients of Ayurvedic drugs. Today the pharmacologically  active ingredients of many Ayurvedic medicines are being identified and their  usefulness in drug therapy being determined.","According to 'Beginnings of drug therapy: drug therapy in ancient India', the ancient medical wisdom from India, known as Ayurveda, is still used today and is pretty important in medicine, especially in India. Many Ayurvedic medicines are made from plant stuff that have active ingredients that can help in treatment. Scientists are now figuring out what these active ingredients are and how they can be used in modern medicine."
I've been having some digestive issues and trouble with my skin lately. Do you think that using something like Tri-phalā could help balance things out?,"In India, since ancient times Tri-phalā (meaning ""three fruits"" in Sanskrit) has  been considered to be a combination of the following fruits: -Harītakī  (Terminalia chebula, Retz.), Āmalaka (Embelica officinalis Gaertn), and  Vibhītaka (Terminalia belerica Roxb.). These plants are also listed in the  Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Harītakī and Āmalaka have also been used for  medicinal purposes since ancient times in Japan under the Japanese names of (see  text) (Kariroku) and (see text) (Annmaroku), respectively. Both have been  carefully preserved as treasured drugs in the nationally important Shosoin  treasure storehouse. This study attempts to clarify the description of Tri-phalā  in the Nāvanītaka, which is the second part of the Bower Manuscript (Bower Ms.),  and examines the reasons why these plants were combined. This paper begins with  a summary description of Tri-phalā in the context of traditional Asian medicine,  followed by the delineation of drug selection principles in Ayurveda. Tri-phalā  formulas in the Nāvanītaka are then examined. The Carakasamhitā (CS) treats  Tri-phalā as a purifier and tonic (rasāyana), describing it as a formula for  rejuvenation and longevity. On the other hand, the Susrutasamhitd (SS) regards  Tri-phalā as having the efficacy of balancing kapha (phlegm) and pitta (bile),  and also as being a medicine to promote excretion and enhance digestive  functions for better nutritional intake. It is described to have an effect of  curing diseases by keeping the tridhāu (theree element) valance. Tri-phalā is  thus used as an ingredient of laxatives for diseases that result from kapha  imbalance and tonic. The Aşţāngahŗdayasamhitā (AHS) considers Tri-phalā to have  a particular superiority among cure-all medicines with the power to dispel  illness. It controls kapha and overcomes blood diseases. Tri-phalā formulas  found in the Nāvanītaka were prescribed for the treatment of abdominal tumors  induced by vāyu (wind) disorder as well as for coughs caused by pitta and kapha  disorder. Tri-phalā was also administered to facilitate nutrient absorption,  regulate bowel function, and promote excretion. Tri-phalā thus restores the  balance of tridhāu by facilitating water distribution in the body. For these  reasons, the optimal combination of Tri-phalā was then established to adjust  kapha for most efficient purification effects.","According to 'Tri-phalā (Three Myrobalans) as Described in the Second Part of the Bower Manuscript, the Nāvanītaka', Tri-phalā is a mix of three fruits that has been used in traditional Indian medicine for a long time. It's like a super supplement that helps your body get rid of toxins, improves digestion, and can even help with certain diseases. Think of it like a natural detox drink that can help you stay healthy and feel better."
"I've heard about this ancient health guide called ""Charaka Samhita"". What kind of natural health tips does it have that I could use in my daily life?","The article considers the findings about pseudo-doctoring represented in one of  the most ancient medical sources on our planet--treatise ""Charaka Samhita""  (Carakasamhitā). This treatise is the most important text of Ayurveda, a  traditional medical system developed in the Hindustan sub-continent during  millenniums.","According to 'The traditional Ayurvedic medicine about pseudo-doctoring as exemplified by ""Charaka Samhita""', the text talks about fake doctors in ancient times. Ayurveda, a super old medical system from India, had ways to spot these fraudsters, kind of like how we can tell dodgy internet scams today. It's pretty cool that they were dealing with the same kind of issues back then!"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda medicine recently. Can you explain what it is and why it's become so popular?,"The Ayurveda medicine as one the three traditional systems of healing developed  during millennia at the Hindustan subcontinent (the ancient India). Nowadays,  Ayurveda medicine is widely used in many countries. The present day researchers  mark out and analyze several periods in its history.","According to 'The stages of development of Ayurvedic medicine', Ayurveda is an ancient healing system that started in India thousands of years ago. It's pretty popular across the world today, and researchers are studying the different phases of its history."
I've heard that chronic inflammation can lead to serious diseases. Are there any natural remedies or herbs that could help reduce it?,"Inflammation, although first characterized by Cornelius Celsus, a physician in  first Century Rome, it was Rudolf Virchow, a German physician in nineteenth  century who suggested a link between inflammation and cancer, cardiovascular  diseases, diabetes, pulmonary diseases, neurological diseases and other chronic  diseases. Extensive research within last three decades has confirmed these  observations and identified the molecular basis for most chronic diseases and  for the associated inflammation. The transcription factor, Nuclear Factor-kappaB  (NF-kappaB) that controls over 500 different gene products, has emerged as major  mediator of inflammation. Thus agents that can inhibit NF-kappaB and diminish  chronic inflammation have potential to prevent or delay the onset of the chronic  diseases and further even treat them. In an attempt to identify novel  anti-inflammatory agents which are safe and effective, in contrast to high  throughput screen, we have turned to ""reverse pharmacology"" or ""bed to  benchside"" approach. We found that Ayurveda, a science of long life, almost  6,000 years old, can serve as a ""goldmine"" for novel anti-inflammatory agents  used for centuries to treat chronic diseases. The current review is an attempt  to provide description of various Ayurvedic plants currently used for treatment,  their active chemical components, and the inflammatory pathways that they  inhibit.","According to 'Identification of novel anti-inflammatory agents from Ayurvedic medicine for prevention of chronic diseases: ""reverse pharmacology"" and ""bedside to bench"" approach', inflammation, which has been linked to a bunch of serious illnesses like cancer and diabetes, is controlled by a certain factor in your body that regulates over 500 different things. And guess what? There are natural substances in Ayurvedic plants, a type of traditional medicine that's been around for 6,000 years, that could potentially slow down or even prevent these illnesses by reducing inflammation. So, maybe it's worth exploring some natural remedies from Ayurveda to stay healthy."
- I've been having some issues with my ears. Does the Sushrutra Samhita mention any ancient remedies that might still work today?,"Sushrutra Samhita is essentially a multi-volume textbook reporting the surgical  practices of ancient India. It covers all aspects of surgery. However, specific  references are made to otorhinological conditions, their description and  subsequent treatments often being described in some detail. In this paper we  outline the structure of the document and attempt to explain its underlying  philosophies. We highlight the specific references to otological diseases and  their treatment and draw the obvious comparisons with modern otological  practice.","According to 'Otology in ancient India', Sushrutra Samhita is like an old-school medical textbook from ancient India. It talks about all kinds of surgery but goes into detail on issues related to ear, nose and throat conditions. The paper tries to explain the ideas and beliefs that shaped these early medical practices. Interestingly, some of the ear treatments they used back in the day aren't too different from what doctors do now."
"Can ancient religious texts like the Mahabharat, Ramayan, or Ayurveda offer any advice for dealing with skin problems?","In view of the description of Medical citations; Vedic literature, Buddhist  literature, Jain literature, Mahabharat, Ramayan etc. have also got significant  importance. Like other diseases, the description regarding Kushtha (different  skin disorders) is also available in all these treatises. These are akin to the  description available in Ayurveda. From the above, it is apparent that  description of different diseases mentioned in Ayurveda are also available in  religious literatures.","According to 'Kushtha (skin disorders) in vedic and other religious literatures - A review', ancient religious texts like the Mahabharat and Ramayan, along with others, contain descriptions of skin disorders similar to those found in Ayurveda. This means that these old-school books could be a treasure trove of information about how to deal with different skin issues. So, next time you're dealing with a bad breakout, maybe an ancient scripture could have some answers!"
Is there any ancient wisdom from the Vŗkşăyurvĕda of Parăśara that can help me lead a healthier lifestyle today?,"Vŗkşăyurvĕda of Parăśara is a great contribution to the Botany in ancient India.  N.N. Sircar and Roma sarkar edited this text with English translation. Notes  with comparative references of modern botany were added. This book can be placed  in all probability in between 1st century B.C to 4th century A.D by its  linguistic style.

It discusses medicinal properties of Aśvattha along with Soma and Kuştha.  Aśvattha is associated with the triad of Gods-Brahma, vişņu and siva. Reference  to Aśvattha is found in Rămăyaņa, Mahăbhărata, Bhagavadgĭta, Buddhistic  literature, Arthaśăstra, Purănăs, Upanişads etc. non-medical literature also.  According to Ayurvĕda it has several synonyms. Most of them symbolize its  sacredness.

I've been hearing a lot about the benefits of exercise and yoga for both your body and mind. Is there any ancient wisdom or techniques that I could incorporate into my routine?,"BACKGROUND: Many western literature on ancient exercise science were available.  Unfortunately ancient Indian contribution in this area was ignored. AIM: The aim of this approach was to search ancient Indian literature on science  of exercise. METHOD: The researcher reviewed thoroughly complete Caraka Samhita (nearly ten  thousand prose and verse) and the outcome was first time reported in this paper. RESULT: More than one hundred and twenty slokes (aphorism) on exercise (vyayama)  were discovered from Caraka Samhita. Oldest definition of exercise was found  from Caraka Samhita, which was percolated from the world's oldest record of  medicine practice. Caraka Samhita has been divided into eight section and it was  observed that in each section vyayama (exercise) was specially referred whenever  needed. The good effect, bad effect, contraindication and feature of correct  exercise were mentioned in Caraka Samhita. The season and time of vyayama has  also been mentioned. Caraka Samhita,also the world's oldest living evidence of  exercise therapy literature prescribed twenty types of kaphaja (phlegm) diseases  and many other diseases (obesity and diabetes etc.) can be cured or minimize the  consequences through vyayama. According to Caraka Samhita, human is the  combination of the body, mind and soul. This Samhita clearly suggested vyayama  (exercise) for the body and yoga for mind and soul. CONCLUSION: From the ancient time India was familiar with the science of  exercise and its beneficial effect. It was forgotten due to local ignorance and  western influence. The contribution of Caraka Samhita and other ancient Indian  literature on the science of exercise should be incorporated in all the  appropriate places as early as possible.","According to 'Science of exercise: ancient Indian origin', ancient Indian texts have a lot to say about exercise that we've kind of forgotten about. The researchers dug through this really old text called the Caraka Samhita, which has more than 120 sections talking about exercise. It not only defines what exercise is, but also talks about the good and bad sides of exercise, and even when's the best time to do it. The text also suggests that exercise can help manage or even cure some health issues like obesity and diabetes. It's pretty cool because it also ties in exercise for the body and yoga for the mind and soul. So, this research wants to remind us about the important role of exercise from an ancient perspective."
"So, the Bible mentions some medicinal plants and old health practices, right? Are there any cool or useful ones that could help me stay healthy today?","The study of history of medical science from non-medical sources needs no  apology. At first the discussion of what was thought in the past rather than  what is known now appears to be of merely antiquarian value.

The Hebrews can be proud of having preserved in the Old Testament many old  medical practices and traditions, which throw light on ancient medicine. The  Bible is genuinely documented book representing the wisdom, medical knowledge  and the culture, of a nomadic race. This article contains information of some  medicinal plants, which are useful for treating different kinds of ailments and  some with nutritious qualities.","According to 'Diet, dietetics and flora of the Holy Bible', the Bible is not just a religious book, it's also a cool history book that has a lot of info about old health practices.

I've been hearing about this Vicharchika skin condition a lot lately. Is it something I should worry about? Can you break it down for me in simple terms?,"Vicharchika which is one of the common skin diseases, is most prevalent among  masses whether rural or urban. A critical peep with regard to this into the  various Ayurvedic Classics reveals that, the various kushtha rogas (including  Vicharchika) were known to ancients of remote antiquity. Though all Ayurvedic  classics have described eighteen varieties of Kushthas dividing into the two  main groups viv. Mahakushthas and Kshudra Kushthas, but they differ in  nomenclature, order, description, doshas involved and prognosis etc.","According to 'Historical review of Vicharchika as per Ayurvedic classics', Vicharchika is a common skin condition that has been known and studied for a long time. It's part of a group of skin diseases called Kushthas. There are 18 different kinds of Kushthas that ancient Ayurvedic texts talk about.

"Did people in ancient India have a lot of stomach issues, and did they find any cool natural remedies that we still use today?","The diseases of the Annavaha Srotas (Gastro-Intestinal tract) seem to have been  very frequent in ancient India as is evidenced by vivid descriptions on various  gastro-intestinal tract diseases in a great length in the treatises of Caraka,  Susruta, Vagbhata etc., and some Indian medical classics. The discussions of  these diseases reveal a comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy, physiology,  pathology of these diseases and study of their treatment is not only edifying  but throws much light on the evolution of our ancestral magnifying knowledge of  these diseases, which is most identical of present modern Gastro-enterology.","According to 'Diseases of Annavaha Srotas (gastroenterology): historical view point', people in ancient India knew a lot about gut health.

I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately. Do you think it could help me figure out why I've been feeling sick so often?,"The reputation of a physician depends more upon his skill in diagnosis and  prognosis. Hence very much importance is given in Ayurveda for the diagnosis of  diseases from a consideration of their etiology, symptoms and prognosis, with an  aim to arrive at a correct diagnosis before starting any treatment. Madhavakara  has brought to perfection the branch of pathology in his work ""Madhava Nidana"",  which represents an attempt towards the revival of the etiopathogenesis,  clinical pathology and diagnosis of a large number of diseases together at one  place from classical sources.","According to 'Definition of Nidana Panchaka (first chapter of Madhavanidana)', being a good doctor isn't just about treating diseases - it's also about figuring out what's causing them in the first place. In Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, there's a lot of focus on understanding the cause and symptoms of a disease before starting any treatment. Madhavakara, an ancient Indian physician, was really good at this and even wrote a book called ""Madhava Nidana"" that covers how to diagnose a bunch of diseases. So, in a nutshell, a good doctor needs to be a good detective too!"
"So, this ""Amavata"" thing is linked to my mood swings too? Can this Satvavajaya therapy help me feel better mentally as well as physically?","Amavata which is popularly correlated with Rheumatoid disease, is characterised  by its eternal course, uncertain progression and unpredictable series of  exacerbations and remissions.

From the time  immemorial the phenomenon of infertility was prevalent through out the world and  this may persist till the human race exists. Every human being has inherent,  intense desire to continue his (one's) own race; to become a mother is one of  the most cherished desires of every woman.

Who was Bhăvamiśra and how did he modernize ancient medical practices like ayurveda?,"Bhăvamiśra, the author of Bhăvaprakăśa was a great scholar in Samsŗt and ancient  medical science.

"I've been feeling off lately, do you think it could be related to my diet and how can Ayurveda help?","Most health problems develop due to the wrong eating habits and cooking methods.  Ayurvĕda deals with the pathya, apathya or pathya vyavastha (planning of diet-  dietetics) in a very scientific and holistic way of Dietetics. The diet planning  mentioned in our classical literature is very rational and based on certain  principles. Lot of importance is given to the diet with regard to its  processing, quality, quantity and so on. Due consideration is given to the  atmosphere, psychological condition, status of health, digestion etc. of the  person while dealing with this issue.

I've heard some old health practices used metals and minerals for healing. Is there any truth to that and how does it work?,"The old age Ayurvedic claim about the therapeutic importance of metals and  mineral bhasmas are time tasted. To make available the evidence for use of  metals and minerals in therapeutics and to provide the knowledge of processing  techniques in ancient India it is very much necessary to look over the history.  Rasa săstra is the branch of Ayurvedic science which deals with the  pharmaceutical processings of the metals and minerals. Svarna Măksika is one of  the most important materials described in various Rasa literatures as well as in  Sarmhităs and in other Ayurvedic texts. Going through the different literatures  its different features, geological distributions and various processing  techniques like sŏdhana, mărana are found. In Samhită period only the features  were described but during 7th Cen. AD & onwards its processings were found. Now  a day Svarrna Măksika is correlated with chalcopyrite by modern metallurgists.  The features of chalcopyrite are also given to assist the more study in this  regard. In the current paper it is tried to collect and compile all the related  area about Svarna Măksika from all possible ancient literary resources as well  as from possible modern texts, to facilitate further research.","According to 'Historical review of Svarna Măksika,' ancient Indian medicine, known as Ayurveda, has a long history of using metals and minerals for healing.

I've heard about these old medicine manuscripts in India. Can they teach us anything about natural remedies or treatments?,"It seems the survey for medical manuscripts has not been done thoroughly so far  in India particularly in Andhra Pradesh. Though few Researchers toured many  important places and collected a number of manuscripts, but still there are many  villages and several families of physicians and scholars possessing many  manuscripts, are not covered. One of the aims and objects of the Indian  Institute of History of Medicine is to procure and study the rare and uncared  medical manuscripts. There are many difficulties in this task as many of the  families in possession of the manuscripts are generally not prepared to hand  over the ancestry property i.e., manuscripts to any individual or institution  due to their sentiments, though they are not able to preserve or make use of  same properly. However, efforts were made by the Institute in this direction,  visiting several families of hereditary physicians residing in different part of  Andhra Pradesh, and procured 12 such valuable palm leaves manuscripts pertaining  to Ayurveda and preserved in the Institute. A brief descriptive catalogue of  these manuscripts is presented here.","According to 'A brief descriptive catalogue of Ayurvedic palm leaves manuscripts procured and preserved in the Indian Institute of Medicine', there are still tons of old medical writings in India that haven't been fully looked into yet. Even though some researchers have been on the hunt, there are still villages and families that have loads of these documents, especially in Andhra Pradesh. The Indian Institute of History of Medicine is trying to get hold of these manuscripts, but it's quite hard because many families aren't that willing to give up these family heirlooms, even if they can't really keep them safe or use them. However, the Institute has managed to get their hands on 12 of these manuscripts related to Ayurveda and they're keeping them safe"
Who can I reach out to if I want to know more about the history of medicine?,"Author information: (1)Institut für Geschichte der Medizin, München.  florian.mildenberger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de","According to 'A wanderer between cultures--Reinhold F.G. Mueller (1882-1966) as Indologist and historian of medicine', the paper explores the life of Reinhold Mueller, who was known for studying Indian culture and history of medicine.

Does studying abroad or doing international service learning help with personal and professional growth in the healthcare field?,"PURPOSE: Awareness of global issues and cultural competence are essential for  health professions students. Educational programs utilize International Service  Learning (ISL) to address global issues and diverse cultures. This study  describes short- and long-term benefits of ISL on Doctor of Physical Therapy  (DPT) students. PROCEDURES: The ISL included study of Ayurveda, clinical service, collaborative  learning, and cultural activities. A mixed-methods design included the Cross  Cultural Adaptability Index (CCAI) administered to 14 students pre- and post-ISL  and qualitative analysis of reflective papers. Interviews of participants were  completed 2 to 3 years later. FINDINGS: Overall CCAI scores showed a statistically significant difference of  0.001 (p<0.01) pre and post ISL. Three subscales also showed a statistically  significant difference (p<0.01). Qualitative analysis of reflective papers  revealed three categories of impact: environmental connectedness, personal  growth, and professional growth. Interviews conducted years following the ISL  indicate that participants attribute several aspects of their professional and  personal way of being to the ISL, including the importance of whole person care. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have shown benefits to health professions students  immediately following an ISL. This study demonstrates that benefits persist  years later. The long-term impact strengthens the rationale for including ISL  during professional education.","According to 'Impact of an International Service Learning Experience in India for DPT Students: Short- and Long-Term Benefits', studying and volunteering abroad can really help physical therapy students grow both personally and professionally. The research shows that students who went to India to learn about Ayurveda, a traditional healing method, and help out in clinics gained a better understanding of different cultures and global issues. This wasn't just a short-term thing - even years later, the students said that the experience still influences the way they work and live, emphasizing the importance of seeing and treating patients as whole people, not just a set of symptoms. So, if you're considering a study abroad program, it may be a great move for your future career and personal development."
Are there any natural remedies or plants that I can use to help with my anxiety and stress?,"Man has been fascinated by nature since he evolved from his primitive ancestors,  the apes. No doubt to start with, he hunted for food mainly by killing the wild  animals, but if there was anything on which he could depend upon with any  confidence towards its availability, it was the plant. Not only the fact that a  large number of plants provided him with food but also the fact that they  provided him with curative medicine and shelter, were perhaps the reasons why he  worshiped them more than the animals which also gave him food. There are a large  number of plants, which are used by the people all over India for curse against  witchcraft or to remove the effect of the evil eye and sickness. The use of the  flora in India to relieve mankind from their sufferings was known from the  ancient days. This includes all food, fuel, shelter, drugs, cosmetics etc. The  standards have been maintained for several centuries since the disciples were  trained in the forest close to the natural flora. In the present paper certain  useful methodologies are evaluated for preparing standard Herbal formulations  and focus mainly on two things namely drug (Dravya) and industry (pharmaceutical  industry).","According to 'Controversies in drug and industry--its measures: a view point', humans have been relying on plants for a lot of things since the beginning, from food and shelter to medicine. In India, many plants are even used as remedies against curses or the evil eye. The paper discusses different ways to prepare these traditional plant-based remedies and how they can be used in the pharmaceutical industry. So, the next time you're out in nature, remember that plants are not just there for looks - they have a lot to offer!"
What's the deal with this ancient Indian text called the Arthaśastra? Does it have some cool health tips from back in the day?,"Kautilya's Arthaśastra which was written somewhere in 321-300 B.C. on ancient  Indian Polity, holds a unique place in Indian history and culture. It was  discovered at Tanjavore district of Mysore in Karnataka. The Manuscript of  Arthaśastra (Devanagiri script) traced by Sri Munisri Jinavijayajee of Patna.  Mr. Shyama Sastry had first published the translated text in 1909 as Volume 37  of the Bibliotheca Sanskrta of Mysore. There are 150 chapters in this work. The  author of this work, Kautilya is also known as Visnugupta or Canakya. The author  himself in the concluding verse of the Arthaśastra quoted his name as  Visnugupta. The later writers on his works also designated his name as Cinakya.  It was also translated into German and Russian languages. The plants and herbs  having medicinal value were compiled the Arthaśastra to bring out the knowledge  of the period and how the people honored, patronized, considered their own  indigenous system as a part of their life. Same information is being presented  in this article.","According to 'Medicinal plants referred in Kautilya's Arthaśastra', an ancient Indian text called the Arthaśastra was found that talks a lot about how people used to use plants and herbs for medicine. This document, which is over 2000 years old, shows that people deeply valued and integrated natural remedies into their everyday lives. It's pretty cool to think that folks back then were into plant-based health, long before it became trendy!"

I've heard that the Banyan tree has medicinal properties. How can it be used for health benefits?,"Nyagrŏdha the Banyan tree (Ficus bengalensis Linn.) is a sacred medicinal plant  since Vedic times. The English name Banyan is given by the Britishers to this  tree because under the tree Banias i.e., the Hindu merchants used to assemble  for business. The triad Ganges, the Himalayas and the Banyan tree are symbolise  the images of India, hence it is considered as National Tree. Ficus means fig  and bengalensis means belonging to or is of Bengal. To the most of Indians it is  Sacred and symbolizes all three Gods of Hindus. The bark represents Lord Visnu,  Brahma the roots and Siva the branches. Since Vedic times its small branches are  used in Yajña (a sacrificial rite) and known for its giant structure. Alexander  the Great is said to have camped under a banyan tree, which was big enough to  shelter his whole army of 7,000 men. As per Vĕda it checks the environmental  pollution and one of the source of Lăksă (Lac). Its medicinal importance is well  documented in Ayurvĕda literature. However, more research needs for  understanding the medicinal properties of this symbolic tree.","According to 'Medico-historical review of Nyagrŏdha (Ficus bengalensis Linn.)', the banyan tree, which is considered a national symbol in India, has been seen as holy since ancient times. It's so big that legend says Alexander the Great's entire army could camp under one. The tree has been used in traditional rituals and is believed to help with environmental pollution. There's also a suggestion that it might have health benefits, but more research is needed to know for sure."
I've heard about astrology being linked to health. Can horoscopes really help me understand what's going on with my body and how I can take care of it better?,"The whole universe is intermingling into a unit in the period of globalization.  Different cultures, life-styles and sciences are co-operating with each other in  this situation. World Health Organization is working towards collaborating all  prevalent medical sciences for attainment of good health and family welfare for  each and every individual by 2020. Astrology is a part of Indian heritage.  Astrology means the art of predicting or determining the influence of the  planets and stars on human affairs. The origin of this word is from Greek word  astron, star + logos (discourse). The account of deeds of good and bad during  the present life and previous lives, their consequences of health or ill health  during this life i.e. what, when and how the things takes place will be clearly  known through Astrology. Highly advanced knowledge related to Astrology on  medicine is preserved in Indian scriptures and the knowledge was transmitted  from generation to generation. It is also a good source for health promotion,  preventive, curative and other medical aspects. Brief direction related to  astrological medical aspects is also available in Ayurvedic literature  (Carakasamhită, Suśrutasamhhită, Aşţăngasangraha, Aşţăngahŗdaya,  Sărngadharasamhită , Băvaprakăśa etc.) Some Ayurvedic practitioners, scholars  and scientists realize the need of astrological knowledge related to medicine in  the present time. In ancient times physician, astrologer and purŏhita (Hindu  priest) simultaneously looked after the health and family welfare of individual,  families and country. Astrologer guides medication and suitable time for the  better cure of ailments. Even the medicinal herbs were collected and treated at  appropriate time for their efficacy. Astrology and Ayurvĕda are inseparable  sciences of life. Hence, in this article, a concise astrological evaluation  related to health promotion, preventive and curative aspects of Astrology is  being presented.","According to 'Health promotion, preventive and curative aspects of diseases in astrology', astrology, which is a big part of Indian culture, can actually play a role in our health. Astrology is all about predicting how the planets and stars can impact our life, including our health. This knowledge has been passed down through generations and is even found in some ancient Indian medical texts. Back in the day, astrologers, doctors, and priests would work together to look after people's health. They believed that the timing of medical treatments and even when herbs were collected could be guided by astrology for better results. So, the paper suggests that astrology might have some valuable insights for promoting good health and preventing and treating diseases."
Does this old Ayurvedic book from Jammu and Kashmir have any cool natural remedies I could try out for my headaches?,"This work reviews the contents of an Ayurvedic treatise ""Sri Ranbira Cikitsa  Sudha Sāra"" authored by Kaviraj Neel Kanth in the year 1931 of Vikrami, in  'Takari' script, the official script during the reign of his highness Maharaja  Ranbir Singh of Jammu and Kashmir.

"I'm interested in trying out some Ayurvedic remedies, but how can I be sure they're made properly and are safe to use?","Safety and efficacy of a drug mainly depends on the method of preparation. To  assess the quality of a finished product, there should be some basic standards  as well as methods of preparation. There are several parameters for testing the  quality of a chemical drug, which have, are true indicators. So, there is no  problem in assessing a synthetic drug's quality. As far as the preparation used  in Ayurvĕdic system of medicine, a drug formulation or design may not be a  problem, because many formulations are well documented in classical texts. But,  there is confusion with respect to standards to be followed while preparing a  formulation as well as basic parameters to assess the quality of the finished  product. In Ayurvĕda, pañcavidhakaşăyakalpana are the basic pharmaceutical  preparations, from which all the other preparations are developed. A specific  method for each and every preparation and some basic standards of finished  products are mentioned in Ayurvĕdic texts to maintain their quality. This  information may some times vary from text to text. To overcome this problem  Sărangdhara mentioned detailed information about various formulations with  respect to their methods of preparation as well as basic standards and are  documented in Sărangdhara Samhita.","According to the 'Standardization of Ayurvĕdic formulations: a scientific review', the safety and effectiveness of a drug depends a lot on how it's made. Just like cooking a meal, there's a recipe to follow. For most modern medicines, it's easy to judge their quality because there are clear, agreed-upon standards. But for traditional Ayurvedic medicines, it's a bit trickier. There are basic recipes in old texts, but there's some confusion about the best way to make them and how to judge the final product. It's like trying to cook grandma's famous stew but everyone in the family has a slightly different version of the recipe. To help fix this, a text called the Sărangdhara"
I've been hearing a lot about this Udumbara plant. Can it really help with stuff like stomach problems or heavy periods?,"Udumbara is well known drug for its use since ancient times. Atharvaveda  considers this as a divine plant and much used in religious sacrifice. It is  also called as Yajñodumbara. It grows abundantly in all parts of India. In  Ayurveda bark, leaves and unripe fruits etc. are used externally and internally  to cure many diseases like Pravahika (Dysentery), Pradara (Menorrhagia),  Raktapitta (Haemoptysis) etc. Thus its medico-historical importance and other  details have been presented in this article.","According to 'Udumbara (Ficus glomerata Roxb.): a medico-historical review', the Udumbara plant, which is common in India, has been used since ancient times to treat various health problems. Different parts of the plant, like its bark, leaves and unripe fruits, are used in different ways to help with issues like severe diarrhea or heavy periods. So, this plant has a long history of being pretty handy for health."
I've noticed some grey and white spots on my skin lately. Are there any natural remedies from Ayurveda that might help?,"In the doctrines of Ayurveda the twak rogas are known by the general term  Kushtha. Atharvaveda describes the twak roga in the name of Kilasa, palita, with  the clinical picture of grey and white spots, generally from deeper layers of  skin and referred the herbal remedies. Almost all the samhitas uniformly  classified Kushtha as Maha Kushtha and Kshudra Kushtha, but there is difference  of opinion about the number in each group. The historical perspectives of the  Twak rogas (Kushtha) are being presented according to Rigveda, Atharvaveda,  Charaka, Sushruta, Vagbhata, Madhavakara Todaramalla.","According to 'Historical perspectives of the twak rogas (Kushtha)', Ayurveda, an ancient form of medicine, has a term ""Kushtha"" for skin conditions. It describes skin issues like grey and white spots coming from deep layers of the skin. Various texts from history have different ways of classifying Kushtha, but all mention natural, herbal remedies for treatment. So, if you've got some weird spots on your skin, maybe looking into some herbal treatments wouldn't be the worst idea!"
Who is Kăyastha Camunda and what are some key points from his work 'Jwaratimirabhăskara' that could help me with my health?,"Out of the treasure of Ayurvĕdic literature, a few texts have come in to lime  light while some are in dark and available in incomplete form.

Who's this Narahari Pandita guy and why is his work about plants and stuff important?,"Narahari Pandita, who was the son of Iśvarasuri and resident of Kashmir was an  erudite scholar of all branches of Sanskrit learning and was also well versed in  regional languages of Karnataka, Maharastra and Andhra. His work Raja-Nighantu  is also known as Nghantu Raja or Abhidhana Cudamani. His date may be placed in  17th century A.D. i.e. after Bhavamiśra. Some of the new and more interesting  plants added are, Brahmadandi, Dhumrapatra, Ekavira, Hastiśundi, Jambu, Jhandu,  Samudraphala, Svetamli, Sveta, Vrścika etc. Thus information about Narahari and  his work is presented in this article.","According to ""Biography of Narahari -- the author of Raja-Nighantu"", Narahari Pandita was a really smart guy from the 17th century who lived in Kashmir and knew a lot about Sanskrit and other local languages from places like Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra.

"So, Ayurveda isn't just for older people, right? Can it help me feel healthier and maybe even boost my immune system?","Ayurveda considers Rasāyana as one of the foremost branches of Astānga Ayurveda  and have rightly justifies its status by the place its given in the Ayurvedic  treatises. The word Rasāyana should not be mistaken as a therapy exclusively  related to old age. It can be applied from pediatrics to geriatrics. Suśruta  defies Rasāyana as a measure, which prolongs and provides positive health,  improves mental faculties and provides resistance and immunity against diseases.  Caraka states that the means of obtaining optimum nourishment to the Dhātus are  called Rasāyanas. This paper is dealt in two ways - components, which accelerate  or trigger an early onset of aging and measures adopted to reverse them.","According to 'The biology of aging (JARA): an ayurvedic approach', Ayurveda, an ancient form of medicine, has something called Rasāyana. It's not just for older people; anyone can use it from babies to grandparents. It's all about keeping you healthy, boosting your brain power and building up your body's defense system against diseases. This research paper talks about two main things: the stuff that speeds up aging and the methods that can help to slow it down."
"So, like, does the way ancient Indian medicine approached health problems have anything to do with how we should handle depression or anxiety today?","In ancient India, two branches of knowledge are concerned with human suffering,  trying to theoretically explain as well as to practically overcome its reasons:  (practical) philosophy and medicine. In spite of being concerned with the same  problem, both rest on different premises: philosophy on highly abstract insights  into the core of the phenomenal world, the atman, which is a priori free from  suffering; and classical (- classical as opposed to modern, westernized -)  medicine on concrete daily manifestations of suffering. Both kinds of occupation  with human suffering implicitly follow a common method, the abstract, i.e.  structural investigation and expression of which we call methodology. This  methodology being explicitly stated in medical texts, we speak of medical  methodology, regardless of the (most probably inanswerable) question in what  branch of knowledge this methodology has been originally developed. The article  is divided into two parts. In the first part, the Buddha's denial of a  transcendent atman is investigated with regard to its implications concerning  the problem of human suffering. Not being able to accept the solution proposed  in the Upanisads, the Buddha conceives a new explanation and solution of the  problem. For that purpose, he explicitly reiterates the medical methodology,  thus attaining a fourfold progressive method which consists in: (1) experience  of suffering, (2) diagnosis, (3) prognosis, (4) solution. In account of this  method's isomorphy to the medical method, Buddhism was regarded as a medical  discipline. The second part of the article is focussed on the third step of the  methodology, the prognosis. According to medical texts, the physician has to  decide in advance whether an illness is curable or not; in the latter case, he  is advised to refrain from treating it. Although this position might be  justified from a pragmatic point of view, it remains unsatisfying when  considered with regard to a categorial system of ethics as it is expounded by  Buddhism. But Buddhism does not only challenge this attitude, it enhances a  solution which integrates prognosis and universal, categorial ethics. The final  paragraph of the article shows how this solution influences later medical texts.","According to 'Interrelations of Buddhism and classical Indian medicine', ancient India had two main ways of dealing with human suffering - philosophy and medicine. Philosophy took a deep dive into the nature of existence and believed that our inner self, or 'atman', doesn't experience suffering. On the other hand, classical medicine dealt with the everyday physical signs of suffering. Interestingly, both methods had a similar approach to problem-solving that's also found in modern medical practice. This approach is to first experience or identify the suffering, then diagnose it, predict its course, and finally find a solution. The research also discusses how Buddhism, which rejected the concept of an eternal inner self, used this same method to address suffering. This led some to view Buddhism as a kind"
"Are there any natural remedies, like essential oils or herbs, that can help fight off bacteria and keep me from getting sick?","The aromatic substances of natural origin are used medicinally in Ayurveda, and  can have diverse bio-dynamic actions. The existing methods like agar-cup method  or disc diffusion method are not adequate to study the exclusive antibacterial  effects of the volatile components of aromatic oils due to lack of ideal  diffusion and evaporation from the surface. Hence an attempt is made to develop  a novel approach to assess the antibacterial activity of few aromatic herbs like  Eugenia caryophyllus, Thymus vulgaris, Cinnamonum zeylanium, Cuminum cyminum;  these were extracted with hexane filled in tiny sterile tubes and the volatile  components were tested for their antibacterial properties using standard strains  of gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria grown on agar slants. The results are  expressed as a percent of inhibition of the area on the slants, from the top of  the extract tube. Of the four herbs selected, volatile components of Thymus  vulgaris were most effective againsts all the seven test organisms.","According to 'A novel approach to study antibacterial properties of volatile components of selected Indian medicinal herbs', some essential oils from certain herbs have properties that can kill bacteria. The research found that out of several herbs, thyme was found to be the most effective at killing bacteria. But, the normal methods we use to test this don't work well due to the oils evaporating too quickly. So, the researchers developed a new way to test it. This could open up new possibilities for natural, plant-based ways to fight bacteria."
"So, there's this thing called Tridŏsa theory in āyurvĕdik Medicine, right? Do you think it has been updated or changed with all the new technology and science stuff we have now?","After the All India Conference held by the Tridŏsa Carcha Parisat as far back as  in 1935, modern review of Tridŏsa theory, the basis of ăyurvĕdik Medicine,  should be undertaken in the light of contemporary advances in science and  technology.","According to 'Modern review of Tridosa theory, the basis of Ayurvedic Medicine', it's time to take another look at Ayurvedic Medicine, an old healing system from India, in light of new scientific discoveries and tech advancements. Just like how we update our phones with the latest software, we should also update our understanding of this ancient medical system."
I've heard about these ancient healing methods called Ayurveda. Are there any cool remedies or techniques in it that I could use in everyday life?,"The Atharvaveda (AV) is by all accounts a curious compendium of medicine in its  various stages of evolution and contains the most primitive as well as some of  the most highly developed stages of therapy. In AV the word Brahma was used in  the sense of Physician. The name Atharvan is almost synonymous with Bhesaja or  medicine. The AV represents the charm system of the Ayurveda of the Vedic age.  The refrain of AV is that, charms and amulets are more efficacious than herbs  and medicine. Kãyaçikitsa (general medicine) is one of the eight branches of  Ayurveda, which has exhaustive mention in the AV and helps to establish the  continuity of medical tradition in the Vedic period. Hence some scholars had  mentioned Ayurveda as Upaveda or Upãnga of AV. AV mentions a large number of  diseases both major and minor some where in clear terms and some where vaguely.  The term used in AV for disease is Yaksma. Classification of the diseases based  on a etiological factors is not found in AV. Thus this article depicts the views  expressed in AV i.e. regarding causative factors, classification and number of  medical disorders with special reference to Yakşma (Consumption).","According to 'General medicine in Atharvaveda with special reference to Yaksma (consumption/tuberculosis)', the Atharvaveda (AV) is an ancient medical text that shows how healthcare evolved. It's like the grandpa of Ayurveda, a type of traditional Indian medicine. AV recognized that charms and amulets were just as important as actual medicine, kind of like how you might wear your lucky socks for a big game. It also talks about lots of different diseases, even though it doesn't really categorize them. One disease it does mention is Yaksma, which is basically an old term for tuberculosis. So, if you're into history or medicine, this could be a cool thing to check"

Such an attempt was also made during the reign of Maharaja  Ranbir Singh of Jammu & Kashmir, when ""Ranbir Prakash"" a compendium of  different. Ayurvedic texts came into existence. In the present paper it is tried  to bring forth the different therapeutic regimens for the management of  different skin afflictions described under Kushtha roga in the ""Ranbir Prakash"".","According to 'Skin diseases - management with reference to Ranbir Prakash', about 5% of people have some kind of skin issue.

Did people in ancient India know about Parkinson's disease and did they have any natural treatments for it?,"The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism was identified in ancient India even  before the period of Christ and was treated methodically. The earliest reference  to bradykinesia dates to 600 bc. Evidences prove that as early as 300 bc,  Charaka proposed a coherent picture of parkinsonism by describing tremor,  rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances as its components. The scenario  was further developed by Madhava, Vagbhata, and Dalhana all through history. The  15th-century classic ""Bhasava rajyam"" introduced the term kampavata, which may  be regarded as an ayurvedic analogue of parkinsonism. The pathogenesis of  kampavata centered on the concept of imbalance in the vata factor, which  controls psychomotor activities. The essential element in therapy was the  administration of powdered seed of Mucuna pruriens, or atmagupta, which as per  reports, contains 4%-6% of levodopa. In addition to proving the existence and  identification of parkinsonism in ancient India, the study points to the  significance of ancient Indian Sanskrit works in medical history.","According to 'The history of parkinsonism: descriptions in ancient Indian medical literature', Parkinson's disease is not a new phenomenon. It was identified and treated in ancient India, centuries before Christ. They even had a name for it, kampavata, and believed that it was caused by an imbalance in the vata factor, which controls our psychomotor activities - basically our ability to move and react quickly. The treatment they used was a powder from the seed of a plant called Mucuna pruriens, which interestingly contains a natural form of levodopa, a drug used today to manage Parkinson's symptoms. This study shows that ancient Indian Sanskrit works have a lot to contribute to our understanding of medical history."

CASE PRESENTATION: A 36 years old moderate built male patient complains of  blackish skin rashes with itching, pain and scaling all over the body for three  months. Based on the symptoms, Dosha (Biological humors) involved were assessed  as Kapha (binding factors) and Vata (vital force of life) and suggestive of  Kitibhakushta. Diagnosis of the Plaque psoriasis was further confirmed by  biopsy. Classical Kushta treatment was adopted here. As Poorvakarma  (pre-operative procedures), Rukshana (Dehydrating therapy) was done and then  Snehapana (intake of medicated ghee) was administered. Then classical Vamana  (emetic therapy) and Virechana (purgative therapy) were performed. This took  almost one month. After Samsarjana (special diet) patient was administered  Manibhadragula as Shodhana Rasayana for a period of one month. At the end of  Manibhadragula intake, remarkable changes were observed in all the symptoms.  There were significant changes seen in PASI, DLQI and photographs taken before  and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Here the special mode of administration of Manibhadragula as  mentioned in Ashtanga Hridaya helps for Shodhana and the Shodhana itself has  Rasayana action. Drugs also have Rasayana property. This made the authors to  propose a new concept called Shodhana Rasayana. Classical treatment by  considering the condition of Roga (disease) and Rogi (patient) helps for  management of Kushta.","According to 'Management of psoriasis with Ayurveda Panchakarma and Manibhadragula as Shodhana Rasayana - a case report', psoriasis, a skin condition that causes itchy and scaly rashes, might not always get better with typical treatments. But, there's an alternative method that seems to work. This study looked at a guy who had psoriasis and treated him with traditional Indian (Ayurvedic) techniques. They basically gave him a special diet, made him throw up and poop (to cleanse his body), and gave him a medicine called Manibhadragula. After a month of this, his symptoms improved a lot. So, maybe this Ayurvedic method could be a new way"
Who was this Susruta dude and why is his work still relevant to modern day urology?,"PURPOSE: Susruta, a pioneer surgeon of antiquity, practiced around 1000 BC in  India. We review his many contributions with special reference to the management  of urological ailments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information gleaned from the available English  translation of 3 volumes of Susruta's treatise in surgery is analyzed with  commentaries and historical perspectives chronicled by Oriental and Occidental  historians. RESULTS: Susruta belonged to the period between 600 and 1000 BC. His conceptions  of anatomy, physiopathology and therapeutic strategies were of unparalleled  brilliance, considering the early age in the history of mankind with no  supportive knowledge base preceding his era. His discussions of many aspects of  urological diseases are often reaffirmed in the principles of urology today. CONCLUSIONS: Through his rational understanding, elaborate teachings and  practice of the art of surgery, and many urological ailments in particular  Susruta has earned the glory of being the pioneer urologist of antiquity.","According to 'Susruta, the pioneer urologist of antiquity', Susruta was a surgeon who lived somewhere between 600 and 1000 BC in India, and was way ahead of his time. This dude was seriously smart, especially when it came to understanding the body and how to treat diseases. What's really cool is that a lot of his ideas about urological diseases - stuff related to the urinary system - still hold up today. So basically, Susruta was the original urology rockstar."
I've heard of this plant called Asparagus racemosus from India that's supposed to have health benefits. What can it do for me and is it safe to use regularly?,"Asparagus racemosus (Willd.) is a widely found medicinal plant in tropical and  subtropical parts of India. The therapeutic applications of this plant have been  reported in Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional system of  medicine, such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. The crude, semi-purified and  purified extracts obtained from different parts of this plant have been useful  in therapeutic applications. Numerous bioactive phytochemicals mostly saponins  and flavonoids have been isolated and identified from this plant which are  responsible alone or in combination for various pharmacological activities. This  review aims to give a comprehensive overview of traditional applications,  current knowledge on the phytochemistry, pharmacology and overuse of A.  racemosus.","According to 'Asparagus racemosus: a review on its phytochemical and therapeutic potential', this plant, commonly found in tropical areas of India, has been used for ages in traditional medicine for its health benefits. The plant contains special chemicals that have various health-boosting properties. However, the paper also warns about the potential risks of overusing this plant. So, it's like adding spices to your food - a little can enhance the flavor, but too much can ruin the dish."
"So, I've been hearing a lot about this alternative medicine stuff. Is it really becoming more popular and accepted in the US?","To assess the current level of acceptance in the United States of complementary  and alternative medicine, recent research into the prevalence, acceptance,  accessibility, and recognition of complementary and alternative therapies were  reviewed. Several signs point to an increasing acceptance of complementary and  alternative medicine in the United States; the use of complementary and  alternative medicine is significantly increasing, many aspects of Chinese  medicine and Ayurveda are becoming mainstream, practitioners in the United  States are beginning to be licensed, and insurance companies are beginning to  cover some complementary and alternative therapies. Remaining challenges to true  acceptance include the restrictive Western mindset, the absence of published  studies, a lack of consistent manufacturing processes and quality standards, and  a fear of adulteration. Although the field still faces many challenges,  alternative and complementary medicine, including Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic  medicine, is becoming more accepted and accessible in the United States.","According to 'The current acceptance, accessibility and recognition of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine in the United States in the public, governmental, and industrial sectors', more and more people in the U.S. are starting to use complementary and alternative medicine like Chinese and Ayurvedic treatments. They're even becoming part of mainstream healthcare, with some doctors now licensed in these fields and insurance companies starting to cover these services. There are still some hurdles to overcome though, like getting people to understand these methods and ensuring that these treatments are made consistently and safely. It's becoming more accepted, but there's still a way to go."
"I've heard that certain plants can help with kidney stones. Is that true and if so, which ones should I look into?","ETHANOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The process of formation or appearance of a  urinary stone anywhere in the renal tract is known as urolithiasis. It is a  longstanding health problem, known to exist since early age of civilization.  Records about symptoms, signs and treatment strategies of urinary stones  diseases are found in the several ancient texts of traditional medicines such as  Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Siddha and Unani. In Ayurveda,  urolithiasis has been considered as one of the eight most troublesome diseases.  Ayurvedic management and cure of urinary stone involves herbal formulas,  alkaline liquids and surgical procedures. Whereas, TCM recommends polyherbal  drugs, acupuncture and mexibustion for treatment of the urinary stones. Among  these therapies, herbal remedies are in practice till today for the treatment  and cure urinary stone diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature about  pathophysiology of urinary stones and antiurolithiatic plants was undertaken  using the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of  Knowledge and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from publications from  all years until Dec., 2015 by combination of the search terms and Boolean  operators; 'urinary stone' OR 'kidney stone' AND 'plant' OR 'medicine' OR  'antiurolithiatic plants'. Outputs were restricted to those completed studies  only published in English. In this review, literatures about plants which are  used as diuretic and/or in treatment urinary tract infections have not also been  considered. The Plant List and Royal Botanical Garden, Kew databases were used  to authenticate botanical names of plants. Books and monographs published in  English were used to collect information about historical records of  antiurolithiatic plants. RESULTS: Recent pharmacological interventions accredited ancient  antiurolithiatic claims to several plants and their formulations. The majority  of antiurolithiatic plants were found to either dissolve the stones or inhibit  the process of urinary stone formation. Plants such as Phyllanthus niruri L. and  Elymus repens (L.) Gould, as well as herbal products including 'Wu-Ling-San'  formula, 'Cystone' and 'Herbmed' have been proved their utility as promising  antiurolithiatic medicines in the different phases of clinical trials. In  addition, some of the isolated phytochemicals such as berberine, lupeol, khelin,  visnagin, 7-hydroxy-2',4',5'-trimethoxyisoflavone and  7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone were reported to have potent antiurolithiatic  activity. CONCLUSION: In ancient medicinal texts, antiurolithiatic potential has been  ascribed to several plants and their formulations. Present scientific studies  provide scientific evidences for few of these claims however, they are  insufficient to establish many of these plants and herbal formulations as  therapeutic remedies for the treatment and management of urinary stones.  Conversely, findings of pre-clinical and clinical studies about some plants and  herbal formulations are promising, which underlines the utility of herbal  remedies as alternative medicines for the treatment and management of urinary  stones in the future.","According to 'Herbal remedies for urinary stones used in India and China: A review', urinary stones, also known as kidney stones, have been a health issue since ancient times. Traditional medicines like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) have used a variety of treatments, including herbs, specific diets, and even some surgical procedures. These traditional remedies are still in use today. Some plants and herbal products have been proven to help dissolve the stones or stop them from forming. However, while some of these traditional treatments have been backed up by scientific studies, more research is needed to truly confirm their effectiveness. So, it's fair to say that herbal remedies could potentially be a future alternative for treating and managing kidney stones."
"I've been dealing with a stuffy nose and sinus issues for a while now. Could Ayurvedic treatments help me out, or is there not enough research to tell yet?","OBJECTIVES: This article provides a comprehensive systematic review and  qualitative analysis of the current research investigating Ayurveda chronic  rhinosinusitis (CRS) treatment. CONTENT: PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews was followed and our search  utilized MEDLINE, Embase, Ayush Portal, and Cochrane Library databases. Articles  published prior to March 2022, 10 or more patients that investigated Ayurveda as  a treatment for CRS in humans were included. This resulted in thirteen articles  meeting inclusion criteria. Ayurvedic treatments included herbal medications for  oral consumption, nasal instillation, and steam inhalation used alone or in  combination. All studies concluded that Ayurvedic therapy led to improvements in  subjective CRS symptoms and objective radiographic and hematologic criteria.  However, all 13 studies had a significant risk of bias due to study design and  statistical methods utilized. SUMMARY: Ayurvedic therapy may be a useful CRS treatment for some patients and  overall appears to be well tolerated. However, definitive recommendation for  when Ayurvedic treatments would be beneficial in the treatment of CRS remains  not possible. OUTLOOK: Given the overall positive effects shown in the current published  evidence and growing interest in complementary and integrative therapies,  Ayurvedic treatments for CRS deserve further investigation in the form of  well-designed controlled trials.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis: a systematic review of randomized and non-randomized trials', Ayurveda might be a good option to treat chronic sinus infections. The study looked at various Ayurvedic treatments, like herbal medicines, nasal drops, and steam inhalation. They found that these treatments helped improve symptoms in lots of people! But, it's important to note that all 13 studies they looked at had some risk of bias. So, while Ayurveda might help with sinus issues, we can't definitively say when it would be the best course of action. That's why more research needs to be done. But if you're interested in non-traditional treatments, it might"
"I've been having some issues with my face feeling a bit weird and off-balance. Could it be this Ardita thing, and would trying out those Ayurvedic oil treatments help at all?","BACKGROUND: Ardita (facial paralysis) is a medical condition that disfigures or  distorts the facial appearance of the sufferer causing facial asymmetry and  malfunction. Ardita patients may benefit from considering alternative treatments  such as Ayurveda, including Taila Nasya (nasal instillation of medicated oil). OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in the treatment of Ardita. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Studies conducted on adult sufferers  (18-70 years) of Ardita (chronic or acute) in any setting were considered.  Studies including participants who were pregnant or suffered allergic rhinitis,  fever, intracranial tumor/hemorrhage and bilateral facial palsy were excluded. INTERVENTION(S)/COMPARATOR(S): Standalone treatment of Nasya (at all dosages and  frequencies) compared to Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic treatments  was considered. Comparisons between different interventions including Taila  Nasya alone, Taila Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic interventions and  Ayurvedic interventions that did not include Taila Nasya were also considered. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Ardita symptoms, including facial distortion,  speech disorders and facial pain, were measured. TYPES OF STUDIES: All quantitative study designs (experimental,  quasi-experimental and observational) were considered. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant studies were identified following a comprehensive  literature search. References provided within these key studies identified  additional resources. Indian universities were also contacted for results of  Ardita studies undertaken in their institutions.A three-step search strategy  aimed to find studies of published and unpublished studies was undertaken.  Studies published in the English language were considered for inclusion,  irrespective of publication date/year. Following an initial limited search of  MEDLINE and CINAHL, the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of  the index terms used to describe each articles were analyzed. From the  identified keywords and index terms, searches were undertaken across all  relevant databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus, Centre  for Review and Dissemination databases, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP),  EMBASE, EBM Reviews, DHARA, Google Scholar, MedNar and ProQuest Dissertations.  Finally, reference lists of identified theses and articles were searched for  additional studies. Universities and website operators related to Ayurvedic  research in India were contacted, including the National Institute of Ayurveda  for relevant studies. Besides this, the University of Adelaide librarian was  contacted to retrieve those studies identified in the reference lists of theses  and articles. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were critically assessed by the review author  and a secondary reviewer prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized  critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted by the primary reviewer using the  standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Different interventions and comparators across studies precluded  meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Only two pseudo randomized studies with a small number of participants  met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study with 20  participants, divided equally into two groups compared the effectiveness of two  nasal instillations in alleviating four Ardita symptoms. The second study of 15  participants each in two groups compared the effectiveness of nasal instillation  with placement of medicated oil on the head on seven Ardita symptoms.  Observational measurements of Ardita symptoms were graded as Mild, Moderate or  Marked at baseline and after one month. The study conducted on 30 participants  using Nasya intervention showed participants had better relief from the symptoms  of facial pain, speech disorder and earache within the range of 78.2% to 90.9%,  graded as Marked. Along with statistical data available in the studies, this  review found low levels of evidence favoring Taila Nasya intervention. The  review did not include any studies examining effectiveness of Nasya compared to  conventional treatment for Ardita. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents extremely limited evidence from only two small  experimental studies that administration of Nasya oil alone may provide some  relief from Ardita symptoms of facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to  shut eyelids/upward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. No  strong conclusions may be drawn from the evidence included in the review due to  the limited number of studies, limited number of participants and poor quality  of studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Practitioners should advice Ardita patients that  there is extremely limited evidence suggesting the potential effectiveness of  Nasya oils alone or Nasya in conjunction with other Ayurvedic treatments in  managing symptoms. However, given the absence of a strong evidence base,  practitioners should be guided by clinical wisdom and patient preference. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Well controlled clinical trials comparing standalone  Nasya therapy to other Ayurvedic treatments and/or conventional medicine for  Ardita symptoms need to be conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in treating Ardita.","According to 'The effectiveness of ayurvedic oil-based nasal instillation (Nasya) medicines in the treatment of facial paralysis (Ardita): a systematic review', if you're dealing with Ardita, which is basically a condition that causes facial paralysis, there's a treatment from Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine, you could consider. It involves putting medicated oil in your nose, known as Nasya treatment. However, the evidence that this works is super limited. Just two small studies have been done, and they showed that it might help with symptoms like facial distortion, speech issues, and even dribbling saliva. But, given that there's very little research done on this, it's a good idea to talk it"
"I've been dealing with a lot of stomach ulcers and inflammation lately. Are there any natural remedies, like plants or something, that could help me out?","Pongamia pinnata root has been advocated in Ayurveda for treatment of various  inflammatory and infective conditions including ulcers. Sequential petroleum  ether, benzene, chloroform, acetone and ethanolic extracts of P. pinnata roots  when administered in the dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p. in rats was found to have  anti-inflammatory, analgesic activity while pentobarbitone-induced 'sleep time'  was reduced by all the extracts except petroleum ether which, however, enhanced  it. They were also found to possess antiulcer effects when administered either  by i.p. (45 min before) or oral route (45 min before or for 4 days) against  restraint-stress or pylorus-ligated gastric ulcers in rats, the maximum  protection being afforded by petroleum ether and ethanol extracts. The mechanism  of antiulcer effect could either be due to decrease in acid-pepsin secretion and  augmentation of mucin secretion as observed with ethanol extract, while  petroleum ether extract might be producing the effect by virtue of its  anti-stress activity.","According to 'Pharmacological actions of Pongamia pinnata roots in albino rats,' the roots of the Pongamia pinnata plant, a traditional medicine in Ayurveda, can help with inflammation, pain, and ulcers. The research found that when given to rats, different extracts from the plant's roots had different effects. For example, most of the extracts reduced sleep time induced by a sedative, but the petroleum ether extract actually increased it. The petroleum ether and ethanol extracts were especially good at protecting against ulcers, possibly by reducing acid secretion, increasing mucus secretion, or reducing stress."
"So, can different weather conditions or environmental factors make it easier to catch COVID-19?","Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the  disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 transmission on  different levels showed that the cold and dry climate, hot wind and relative  humid wind, maximum wind speed, turbulent wind, intensified recirculating flow  were causing transmission higher than factors. The role of environmental factors  described in Ayurveda like air, water, soil, season, frequent earthquakes,  sunlight exposure, frequent thunderstorm with lightening, and factors from  arthropods were revalidated in perspective of COVID-19 transmission. The authors  searched the information regarding epidemic diseases in Ayurveda textbooks.  Pubmed, Science Direct, Wikipedia, Elsevier, Lancet, and Springer were  approached for the latest knowledge relating to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Google  Scholar search engine was thoroughly checked upon for scientific evidence  regarding the Ayurveda drugs. Various environmental factors like soil, air,  water, frequent earthquake disasters, wildlife animals, aquatic birds, space,  inevitable disastrous factors, weather or seasonal hazards, violent thunderstorm  with lightning, intermediate hosts, sunlight exposure etc. were considered for  their role in the genesis of the disease. The Ayurvedic concepts behind the  etiology and development of epidemics are the same as modern epidemiological  theories. The mysteries of many aspects of the current pandemic might be  deciphered by traditional medicine knowledge and thus adding upon to the  integrative medicine concept.","According to 'Transmission modes of COVID-19 disease pandemic in the light of ancient wisdom of Ayurveda medicine: a review', catching and spreading COVID-19 isn't just about being around sick people. Things like the weather, wind speed, and even stuff like earthquakes and thunderstorms can change how much the virus spreads. Just like the Ayurvedic medicine says, our environment plays a huge role in disease. So, it's not just about washing hands and wearing masks, but also about where we are and what's happening around us."
Is Ayurvedic treatment like using Rumalaya or Shunti-Guduchi a good alternative for managing my osteoarthritis pain?,"Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing systems within complementary and  alternative medicine. However, the evidence for its effectiveness is  unsatisfactory. The aim of this work was to review and meta-analyze the  effectiveness and safety of different Ayurvedic interventions in patients with  osteoarthritis (OA). 138 electronic databases were searched through August 2013.  Randomized controlled trials, randomized crossover studies, cluster-randomized  trials, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials were eligible. Adults with  pre-diagnosed OA were included as participants. Interventions were included as  Ayurvedic if they were explicitly labeled as such. Main outcome measures were  pain, physical function, and global improvement. Risk of bias was assessed using  the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 19 randomized and 14 non-randomized controlled  trials on 12 different drugs and 3 non-pharmaceutical interventions with a total  of 2,952 patients were included. For the compound preparation, Rumalaya, large  and apparently unbiased effects beyond placebo were found for pain (standardized  mean difference [SMD] -3.73; 95 % confidence interval [CI] -4.97, -2.50; P <  0.01) and global improvement (risk ratio 12.20; 95 % CI 5.83, 25.54; P < 0.01).  There is also some evidence that effects of the herbal compound preparation  Shunti-Guduchi are comparable to those of glucosamine for pain (SMD 0.08; 95 %  CI -0.20, 0.36; P = 0.56) and function (SMD 0.15; 95 % CI -0.12, 0.36; P =  0.41). Based on single trials, positive effects were found for the compound  preparations RA-11, Reosto, and Siriraj Wattana. For Boswellia serrata, Lepidium  Sativum, a Boswellia serrata containing multicomponent formulation and the  compounds Nirgundi Taila, Panchatikta Ghrita Guggulu, and Rhumayog, and for  non-pharmacological interventions like Ayurvedic massage, steam therapy, and  enema, no evidence for significant effects against potential methodological bias  was found. No severe adverse events were observed in all trials. The drugs  Rumalaya and Shunti-Guduchi seem to be safe and effective drugs for treatment of  OA-patients, based on these data. However, several limitations relate to  clinical research on Ayurveda. Well-planned, well-conducted and well-published  trials are warranted to improve the evidence for Ayurvedic interventions.","According to 'Ayurvedic interventions for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis', there's a type of alternative medicine called Ayurveda that's getting pretty popular. This research looked into whether or not Ayurveda can help people with osteoarthritis, a condition where your joints become painful and stiff. They found that some Ayurvedic treatments, like a drug called Rumalaya and a herbal mix called Shunti-Guduchi, could help reduce pain and improve overall condition. However, other treatments, like Ayurvedic massage and steam therapy, didn't show any major benefits. It's worth noting that this is based on limited research, so it's not set in stone. But if you're dealing with"
I've been hearing a lot about martial arts being good for your health. How exactly does practicing something like kalarippayattu from South India help improve my body and mind?,"This paper describes three interconnected conceptions of the body in  kalarippayattu, the martial tradition of Kerala, South India. It traces  continuities and discontinuities among concepts and practices recorded in  classic source texts and contemporary martial practice for each of the three  'bodies of practice'. The first is the fluid body of humors and saps. The second  is the body as superstructure composed of bones, muscles, and vital spots  (marma-s), which supports the fluid body. The concepts and practices of the  first two bodies are based on the regional tradition of Ayurveda. They  constitute the external physical body (sthula-śarira). The third, subtle or  interior body (suksma-śarira) is thought to be encased within the physical body.  It provides an experiential map of practice and is the basis for higher stages  of meditation. The long-term practice of the martial art (1) makes the body  fluid so that healthful congruence of the humors occurs, (2) establishes an  intuitive and practical knowledge of vital points (marma) useful in fighting  (prayogam) and in treating injuries, and (3) purifies the subtle body and  awakens the internal vital energy (prana-vayu) that is manifest as the power  (śakti) of the master in combat or medical practice. The paper concludes with a  discussion of the interrelationship between these three concepts of the body in  the accomplished practice of the martial practitioner.","According to 'Three bodies of practice in a traditional South Indian martial art', the martial art form from South India, kalarippayattu, works on three different levels of the body. The first part is like the liquid part of your body, think of it as your blood and other fluids. The second part is your physical body, so all your bones and muscles. The third part is the more spiritual side, like your feelings and thoughts. Practicing this martial art helps balance the fluids in your body, teaches you about the important parts of your body that can be used in fighting or healing, and helps find peace and power within yourself. It's like a workout for your mind, body, and soul."
I've been feeling super stressed out lately. Are there any natural remedies or plants that might help me cope better?,"Plants from all over the world such as Eleutherococcus senticosus, Panax  ginseng, Raponticum carthamoides, Rhodiola rosea, Withania somnifera and Ocimum  sanctum have been extensively evaluated for their adaptogenic potential.  However, none of them has been successfully introduced as an adaptogen in the  clinic. This paper discusses some of the problems in evaluation of adaptogens  which have precluded their inclusion as clinically useful drugs. We further  discuss our results with six rasayana plants from Ayurveda, which were studied  for their adaptogenic potential. The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of  selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis,  Withania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered  orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose,  following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and  chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these  stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective  parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced  alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a  normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.  All the plants reversed the effects of cisplatin on gastric emptying, while  Tinospora cordifolia and Asparagus racemosus also normalized cisplatin induced  intestinal hypermotility. Tinospora cordifolia was also tested for its ability  to modulate the changes occurring in the phagocytic activity of peritoneal  macrophages after exposure of rats to either carbon tetrachloride or horse  serum. It was found to normalize the phagocytic function irrespective to the  direction of change, complying to the definition of an adaptogen. All the plant  drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies  on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced  immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress  induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked.  Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical  damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to  depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent  data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia suggest that it may induce genotypic  adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.","According to 'Adaptogenic properties of six rasayana herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine', scientists have been looking at different plants from around the world to see if they can help our bodies deal better with stress. They haven't found one that can be used in hospitals yet, but they did find some interesting stuff with six plants from traditional Indian medicine called Ayurveda. 

These plants were given to animals, who were then put under different types of stress. The results showed that these plants helped protect the animals from the harmful effects of the stress. One of these plants, Tinospora cordifolia, was even able to help balance out the body's responses to harmful substances, which is a key characteristic of what scientists call an '"
I've heard that some plants can boost my energy naturally. Any suggestions from the world of Ayurveda?,"A lot of medicinal plants, traditionally used for thousands of years, are  present in a group of herbal preparations of the Indian traditional health care  system (Ayurveda) named Rasayana proposed for their interesting antioxidant  activities. Among the medicinal plants used in ayurvedic Rasayana for their  therapeutic action, some of these have been throughly investigated. In the  present paper seven plants (Emblica officinalis L., Curcuma longa L., Mangifera  indica L., Momordica charantia L., Santalum album L., Swertia chirata Buch-Ham,  Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) are viewed for their historical, etymological,  morphological, phytochemical and pharmacological aspects. The plants described  contain antioxidant principles, that can explain and justify their use in  traditional medicine in the past as well as the present. In order to identify  the plants with antioxidant activity in Ayurveda, a formulation of some  rasayanas with well defined antioxidant properties has been examinated. For this  purpose, we have considered Sharma's work on the preparation MAK4, MAK5, MA631,  MA 471, MA Raja's Cup, MA Student Rasayana, MA Ladies Rasayana.","According to 'Review on some plants of Indian traditional medicine with antioxidant activity', certain plants used in Ayurveda, an ancient Indian healthcare system, are packed with antioxidants. These include seven plants that you might have heard of like turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and mango (Mangifera indica L.).

That's why they're part of a special group of herbal preparations called Rasayana. Some of these preparations have been studied thoroughly, showing they indeed have amazing antioxidant powers. So, including these plants in your diet could be a cool, natural way to boost your overall health!"
I've got this persistent skin issue that's really bringing me down. Could Ayurvedic treatments like purging and stuff help me feel better overall?,"BACKGROUND: Chronic skin conditions can have a negative impact on one's quality  of life, affecting their physical, functional, and emotional well-being. Whereas  biopurifactory measures (panchakarma) of Ayurveda claims to provide better  quality of life after treatment. Hence current study is planned to provide  evidence in patients with skin disorders, undergoing Ayurvedic treatment. METHODOLOGY: Sixty patients with skin disorder, who underwent purification  therapies like therapeutic emesis and therapeutic purgation, were randomly  placed in 2 groups to assess quality of life. Quality of life assessment was  done with the help of Skindex-29 among the patients before and after Ayurvedic  purification therapy. Thereafter, the quality of life assessment was done on the  first follow-up. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in the quality of life  domains-emotions, functioning, and symptoms-after the Ayurvedic management was  observed with P value <.001. CONCLUSION: Study concludes that there is improvement in quality of life among  patients with skin disease after undergoing Ayurveda purification therapies.","According to 'Assessment of Quality of Life in Patients With Skin Disorders Undergoing Ayurvedic Panchakarma (Biopurification) as Management', Ayurvedic treatments like detox therapies for skin problems can really improve your life. Not just physically, but also emotionally and in day-to-day functioning. The study showed that people who underwent these treatments felt a significant positive change in their lives. So, if you're struggling with a chronic skin condition, Ayurvedic purification therapies might be worth looking into."
"I've been thinking about trying some herbal remedies for my health issues, but I'm worried about harmful stuff in them, like heavy metals. Are they safe to use?","Traditionally, the herbal drugs are well established for their therapeutic  benefits. Depending upon their geographical sources sometimes the trace and  heavy metals' content may differ, which may lead to severe toxicity. So, the  toxicological and safety assessment of these herbal drugs are one of the major  issues in recent days. Eight different plant species including Aloe vera,  Centella asiatica, Calendula officinalis, Cucumis sativus, Camellia sinensis,  Clitoria ternatea, Piper betel and Tagetes erecta were selected to determine  their heavy and trace metals content and thereby to assure their safer  therapeutic application. The trace and heavy metals were detected through atomic  absorption spectrometry analysis. The selected medicinal plant materials were  collected from the local cultivated regions of West Bengal, India, and were  digested with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid as specified. Absorbance was  measured through atomic absorption spectrometer (AA 303) and the concentration  of different trace and heavy metals in the plant samples were calculated. The  quantitative determinations were carried out using standard calibration curve  obtained by the standard solutions of different metals. The contents of heavy  metals were found to be within the prescribed limit. Other trace metals were  found to be present in significant amount. Thus, on the basis of experimental  outcome, it can be concluded that the plant materials collected from the  specific region are safe and may not produce any harmful effect of metal  toxicity during their therapeutic application. The investigated medicinal plants  contain trace metals such as copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron  (Fe) and nickel (Ni) as well as heavy metals such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and  mercury (Hg), which were present within the permissible limit.","According to 'Determination of trace and heavy metals in some commonly used medicinal herbs in Ayurveda', researchers checked out some common plants used in herbal medicine, like Aloe Vera and Green Tea, to see if they had any harmful metals in them. They collected these plants from local areas in West Bengal, India, and used a machine to measure if these plants had any heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury. Good news is, these plants were all in the clear and didn't have any dangerous levels of metals. This means they're safe to use and won't give us any metal poisoning when we use them for their health benefits."
I've heard that some plants can help with pink eye. Do you know any natural remedies I could try?,"Conjunctivitis is a major occular external infection in tropical countries.  Although not a very serious disease, it gives much discomfort and sometimes  leads to partial blindness or blindness due to corneal involvement.  Conjunctivitis has been known to occur in epidemic proportions in different  parts of the world, mainly African and Asian regions. The indigenous cure of  conjunctivitis using herbal products has been popular for centuries. This paper  is an attempt to compile information on plants mentioned as a cure for  conjunctivitis during ethnobotanical surveys between 1933 and 2000. Plants  mentioned as a cure in various systems of medicine, namely Siddha and Ayurveda,  are also included.","According to 'A review of plant species used to treat conjunctivitis', pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is a big issue in hot countries. It's not usually super serious, but it's definitely annoying and can sometimes even lead to blindness if it affects the transparent front part of your eye. Pink eye outbreaks can happen all over the world, but they're especially common in Africa and Asia. The paper looks at how for hundreds of years, people have been using plants to treat pink eye. It pulls together information from surveys done between 1933 and 2000 about which plants have been used in traditional medicine systems like Siddha and Ayurveda to help with this issue."
"I heard that the ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, was used to prevent aging effects. Are there any simple Ayurvedic tips I could follow to stay healthy?","Research on aging in India has been well documented since ancient times. As way  back as 3000-1500 BC, the Indian medical system of Ayurveda was used as a means  for the prevention of the effects of aging and generation of disease in organs  or the whole organism, respectively. In recent years, the focus has been  demographic studies on different aspects of aging and has been in isolation.  Molecular aspects of aging have been addressed only by a few groups of  scientists which has focused on regulation of gene expression, DNA damage and  repair, development of immunochemical reagents to detect oxidative DNA damage  and assessing the levels of circulating antibodies to reactive oxygen species  modified DNA (ROS-DNA), etc. This review aims to recapitulate various research  studies on aging since 3000 BC to date.","According to 'Aging research in India', studying how people age has been a thing in India since as far back as 3000-1500 BC! They used to use Ayurveda, a traditional Indian healing system, to help prevent aging and disease. Nowadays, the research is more focused on how different aspects of aging affect us, but there's also some super science-y stuff about genes and DNA damage. Basically, scientists are still figuring out all the ins and outs of why we age and how to slow it down."
I've heard that Parkinson's can start showing symptoms at any age. Are there any natural remedies or herbs I can take now to possibly prevent or manage it in the future?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants like Mucuna pruriens L.(DC) and  Withania somnifera L.(Dunal) have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to  manage neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. AIM: The aim of this review is to share the role of Ayurveda's insights,  traditional usage and contemporary investigations for translational, integrative  applications to manage Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High impact journals for Parkinson's diseases,  traditional textbooks from Ayurveda as well as relevant clinical and para  clinical studies with botanicals are selectively incorporated to evolve the  aforesaid translational application. RESULTS: . A. CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING AND EXISTING THERAPEUTIC GAPS: Parkinson's disease  (PD) is a complex multi-system, neurodegenerative disease. Though predominantly  perceived as a motor disease, it also has debilitating non- motor features,  which are frequently missed and not treated. Major treatment goals are to  increase striatal dopamine levels with precursor-substitution and/or reduce its  breakdown. As the disease progresses, a steady increase in the dose of levodopa  is inevitable. However, higher doses cause motor complications of dyskinesia and  dystonia and compromise medical treatment. B. ROLE OF MUCUNA PRURIENS L.DC), THE  MOST PROMISING BOTANICAL FROM AYURVEDA: Ayurveda offers a natural source of  levodopa - the seeds of Mucuna pruriens L.(DC)- which have a long standing safe  use in the condition. Its clinical studies have shown pharmacokinetic profile  distinct from synthetic levodopa, which is likely to reduce the untoward motor  complications. Additionally, its seed extracts have shown neuroprotective  benefits which are unrelated to levodopa. C. AYURVEDIC REGIMENS AND MEDICINAL  PLANTS FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE AND SYMPTOMATIC BENEFITS: Other regimens  (Panchakarma) and medicinal plants used in Ayurveda have been subjected to  exploratory studies with promising early results in the condition. The  debilitating non motor symptoms in patients have shown response with one of the  regimens - medicated oil enema (basti). Effects of two medicinal plants Withania  somnifera(L.)Dunal and Curcuma longa Linn in Parkinson's Disease related models  have been discussed in detail. We have also shared a shortlist of medicinal  plants most likely to be useful in management of specific features of the  disease such as cognitive decline, mood disorders, risk of osteoporosis amongst  others. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda with its medicinal plants and treatment approaches, can  strengthen the therapeutic armamentarium of PD to improve clinical outcomes, if  these leads are systematically further investigated by well-designed longer term  studies.","According to 'Management of Parkinson's disease in Ayurveda: Medicinal plants and adjuvant measures', certain plants that have been used in traditional Indian medicine might help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms. This includes a plant called Mucuna pruriens, which naturally contains levodopa - a chemical usually given to Parkinson's patients to help manage their symptoms. This natural version might even cause fewer side effects than the synthetic one. Other plants and treatments used in Ayurveda have also shown promising early results in managing symptoms, especially non-motor symptoms that often get overlooked. However, more long-term studies are needed to confirm these benefits."
I've heard that some herbs might help in cancer prevention. Are there any specific types I should include in my diet?,"This paper critically examines the Ayurvedic concept of cancer diathesis and its  pathogenesis in terms of the theory of Tridosa, Sapta Dhātus (body tissues), the  Agni or body's biologic fire, Srotámsi (i.e., channels of the body), and the  generic sequence of events in the genesis of a disease (e.g., Satkriyākala). All  this depicts a new paradigm of the disease state. This paper also examines the  scope of plant drugs used in the treatment of cancer. A retrospective  meta-analysis of observations on 85 plant drugs reported to have an anticancer  effect indicates that herbs with Katu, Tikta, Kasāya Rasa (bitter, pungent, and  astringent taste), Usna Virya (e.g., hot biopotency), and Katu Vipāka (catabolic  active metabolites), and herbs with dry, coarse, light, and sharp biophysical  properties have significantly greater possibilities of producing anticancer  effects.","According to 'An assessment of the Ayurvedic concept of cancer and a new paradigm of anticancer treatment in Ayurveda', the Ayurvedic idea of cancer is all about balancing your body's natural functions, which they call Tridosa, and making sure everything is running smoothly. This includes stuff like your body's 'biologic fire', the channels your body uses to move stuff around, and how diseases start and progress. The paper also talks about how certain herbs might be good for treating cancer. They found that herbs with certain characteristics - like being hot, bitter, pungent, or astringent - and those that have dry, coarse, light, and sharp properties, might be especially good at fighting cancer."
I've been hearing a lot about this plant called Ashwagandha. Is it true that it can help prevent or even treat breast cancer?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha has been used as an ayurvedic  medicine in the form of 'Rasayana' (as a tonic) even before 3000 BCE in India.  As per Ayurveda, it has long been used traditionally for the treatment of  inflammation, weakness, impotence, pulmonary tuberculosis. This plant is also  beneficial in lumbago and leucorrhea in the female. In the recent past, Withania  has shown its anti-cancerous activity in various experimental models. In  addition, Withania also possesses many other properties such as anti-oxidant,  anti-stress, adaptogenic, and regenerative which will eventually be beneficial  and safe in treating cancer patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review aims to provide experimental evidence along with a  deeper insight into molecular mechanisms of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.)  Dunal) through which it acts as a chemotherapeutic agent against different types  of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature searches with the help of electronic online  databases (Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scopus, Springer Link, ScienceDirect,  ResearchGate, PubMed) were carried out. The timeline for collection of data for  the review article was from 2000 to 2019. The plant name was validated from The  Plant List (2013). Version 1.1. Published on  http://www.theplantlist.org/(accessed 21st March 2020). RESULTS: Various forms of Withania somnifera were used and several in vitro, in  vivo, and clinical studies were reported by researchers. They found ashwagandha  to exhibit anti-apoptotic, anti-metastatic, anti-invasive and anti-inflammatory  properties and gave the evidence that ashwagandha has a capability for averting  and treating breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Various in vitro and in vivo studies suggested Ashwagandha may  possess a potential for treating breast cancer, especially ER/PR positive breast  cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. A clinical trial has also been  conducted in the past that suggested its potential in refining quality of life  in breast cancer patients. Studies directed towards molecular pathways have  helped in unravelling the key mechanisms of ashwagandha. Future research should  be directed towards translational studies involving breast cancer patients.  These will reinforce the ancient power of our Ayurvedic medicine.","According to ""Keeping abreast about ashwagandha in breast cancer,"" Ashwagandha, a plant that's been used in traditional Indian medicine for centuries, could be a new ally in the fight against breast cancer. Researchers have found that this plant has a bunch of beneficial properties, such as being anti-stress and helping cell regeneration. But most importantly, it's shown some promising signs of being able to prevent and treat breast cancer. There's still a lot of research to be done, but it could potentially be a natural way to improve the quality of life for people battling this disease."
"So, I came across this thing called Ayurvedic bhasma, which is apparently some kind of nanomedicine. Is it safe to use and can it help with any health issues?","Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicine, practiced in Indian sub  continent. We are working to calibrate classical parameters of good  manufacturing practices of Ayurvedic bhasma on parameters and language of  contemporary science. Bhasma in accordance of classical expectation are Swarna  bhasma, Makshika bhasma, Abhrak bhasma, Tamra bhasma and Louha bhasma. X-ray  diffraction, TEM and particle size analysis revealed that these bhasma are in  nanometer dimension. These bhasma may be considered as nanomedicine and are free  from toxicity in therapeutic doses.","According to 'Ayurvedic bhasma: nanomedicine of ancient India--its global contemporary perspective', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, uses tiny particles called bhasma to help treat people. These bhasma, which are so small they're measured in nanometers, are being studied to understand how they fit into modern science. The cool thing is, they're seen as a type of nanomedicine and don't seem to have toxic effects when used in the right amounts."
Why are there so few Dalit people practicing Ayurvedic medicine in Nepal?,"Ayurvedic medicine thrives in Nepal. Even so, barriers of untouchability that  have long prevented Dalits from establishing equal relationships with upper  castes have made medical education out of reach for them. Hence, nearly all  Ayurvedic practitioners are high caste men. Forty years ago, an ""untouchable""  man from the Himalayan foothills with a thirst for knowledge about Ayurveda  traveled south into India where he changed his caste and ""became"" a Brahman for  14 years as he studied the theory and practice of Ayurvedic medicine in a  Haridwar college. Rasaliji's life story, recorded initially in 2000 and  continued through 2007-2008, encompasses a period of rapid modernization that  spawned a state health policy promoting biomedicine, a proliferation of  pharmaceutical drugs, and a national election that swept the Communist Party of  Nepal-Maoist into power and saw an unprecedented 9 percent Dalits elected to the  Constituent Assembly. This article presents Rasaliji's current concerns with the  state of medicine and social justice in Nepal.","According to 'Untouchable healing: a Dalit Ayurvedic doctor from Nepal suffers his country's ills', there's a dude in Nepal who really wanted to study Ayurvedic medicine, a type of traditional healing. The problem was, he was part of the Dalit caste, which is considered the lowest and they were often discriminated against. To get around this, he moved to India, claimed to be from a higher caste, and spent 14 years studying. His story happened during a time when Nepal was changing a lot, with more modern medicine coming in and political shifts happening. Now, he's worried about the state of healthcare and social justice in Nepal."
"I'm trying to live a healthier lifestyle. Can following Ayurveda practices, like good nutrition and diet, really help reduce my stress and emotional ups and downs?","Āyurveda, the science (ved) of life (ayu), owing its origin to Veda, the oldest  recorded wisdom of human civilization written in 3500 BCE, contains extensive  knowledge of various diseases and their therapeutic approaches. It essentially  relied on nature and the immune system of an individual, and therapeutic  interventions were introduced only to augment the immune system. Āyurveda had  eight specialties, including psycho-neuroscience (a combination of psychology,  clinical psychology and psychiatry) and a unique promotive therapy encompassing  nutrition, rejuvenation and geriatrics. The symptoms of various brain disorders,  including memory disorder, were well defined. The goal of Āyurveda was to help  an individual to achieve his cherished goal of leading a healthy life of 100  years. To achieve this, great emphasis was laid on nutrition, diet and a good  conduct by the two great exponents of Āyurveda viz. Carak and Suśruta. By  following these regimens, an individual could lead a less stressful life free  from emotional disturbances. Both Carak and Suśruta had believed that these in  combination with rasayana (rejuvenating) plants could enable an individual to  lead a healthy life of 100 years.","According to 'Brain enhancing ingredients from Āyurvedic medicine: quintessential example of Bacopa monniera, a narrative review', Ayurveda, an ancient health practice from over 5000 years ago, is all about living a long, healthy life. It focuses on using nature and your body's immune system to stay healthy. Apart from using natural remedies, Ayurveda also emphasizes the importance of eating right, staying fit, and maintaining a positive mindset. By following this lifestyle, the stress levels can be reduced, and emotional disturbances can be avoided. So, if you're looking to live a healthier and potentially longer life, Ayurveda could offer some interesting insights."
"So, there are these things called roxburghiadiol A and roxburghiadiol B in Aglaia roxburghiana. What are they and can they benefit my health in any way?","Two new 14 alpha-methylsterols, roxburghiadiol A and roxburghiadiol B, were  isolated from the leaves and fruits of Aglaia roxburghiana. Previously their  structures were tentatively assigned as 4-bisnormethyl-24-methylene-cycloarta-3  beta, 7 alpha-diol and 4-bisnormethyl-24-methylene-cycloarta-3 beta, 6  alpha-diol, respectively. A reinvestigation using 2D-nmr technique has confirmed  the structure 2 for roxburghiadiol B as previously reported, and roxburghiadiol  A is now found to be the corresponding 6 beta epimer 1.","According to 'Roxburghiadiol A and roxburghiadiol B, two 14 alpha-methylsterols from Aglaia roxburghiana', scientists found two new compounds in the leaves and fruits of a plant called Aglaia roxburghiana.

"So, this plant called 'Sarapunkha' seems to have a lot of health benefits. Is it something I could use to naturally improve my health?","Tephrosia purpurea (L.) Pers. is popularly known as 'Sarapunkha' in classical  Ayurvedic texts. It is a perennial plant belonging to the family Fabaceae, and  occurs throughout the Indian subcontinent. T. purpurea is traditionally used to  treat splenomegaly, cirrhosis, cough and cold, abdominal swelling and as an  antidote in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Phytochemical investigations  indicate the presence of semiglabrin, pongamole, lanceolatins A and B, rutin,  lupeol, and β-sitosterol. Flavonoids including (+)-tephrorin A and B,  (+)-tephrosone, an isoflavone, 7, 4'-dihydroxy-3', 5'-dimethoxyisoflavone and a  chalcone, (+)-tephropurpurin were isolated from the whole plant. Pharmacological  activities of different parts of the plant reported include anti-inflammatory,  antiulcer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiallergic, antidiabetic,  hepatoprotective, antitumor and insect repellent activity. In the present  review, the literature on the phytochemical and pharmacological investigations  of Tephrosia purpurea (L.)

Scientists have discovered that it contains a bunch of chemicals that are good for our health. These include anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, and antioxidant properties. It's even been found to have potential anti-cancer and diabetes-fighting abilities. So, it seems like this plant is a real powerhouse of health benefits!"
I've heard about this Ayurvedic mix called 'Trikatu'. What's in it and what's so special about it?,"'Trikatu' is an Ayurvedic preparation containing black pepper, long pepper and  ginger, which is prescribed routinely for a variety of diseases as part of a  multidrug prescription. These herbs along with piperine (alkaloid of peppers)  have been shown to possess diverse biological activities in mammalian systems. A  review is presented of these studies and it has been suggested that their use in  the Indian system of medicine could be due to their bioavailability enhancing  action on other medicaments.","According to 'An Ayurvedic formulation 'Trikatu' and its constituents', Trikatu is a natural remedy that blends black pepper, long pepper, and ginger.

I'm interested in Ayurveda and its health benefits. How can I find good articles or reliable information about it?,"BACKGROUND: Literature searches for articles on Ayurveda provide special  challenges, since many of the Indian journals in which such articles appear are  not indexed by current medical databases such as PubMed and Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials. AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive search strategy on  Ayurveda topics and to map the existing databases containing Ayurveda journal  publications. METHODS: We have developed a literature search procedure that can recover the  great majority of articles on any given topic associated with Ayurveda. RESULTS: Our system is formulated in an easily reproducible fashion that all  researchers can use. Using the keywords related to Ayurveda and vitiligo, we  searched 41 databases that may contain complementary and alternative medicine  publications. Only 11 databases yielded results; PubMed contained 9 articles.  Each of 14 other databases named in our search procedure averaged 23 articles.  International Bibliographic Information of Dietary Supplements, for example,  gave 22, of which 1 satisfied our eligibility criteria. ""Annotated Bibliography  of Indian Medicine"" gave 47, of which 7 satisfied eligibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This article proposes guidelines enabling comprehensive searches to  locate all types of Ayurvedic articles, not necessarily only randomized  controlled trials.","According to 'Conducting literature searches on Ayurveda in PubMed, Indian, and other databases', it's tough to find all the articles on Ayurveda - a traditional medicine system from India - because a lot of them are in Indian journals that aren't listed in the usual medical databases.

What kind of natural remedies could I expect if I went to a traditional healer in India?,"BACKGROUND: Traditional medicine in India can be classified into codified  (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) and non-codified (folk medicine) systems.  Both the systems contributing equally to the primary healthcare in India. The  present study is aimed to understand the current scenario of medicinal practices  of non-codified system of traditional medicine in Belgaum region, India. METHODS: The study has been conducted as a basic survey of identified  non-codified traditional practitioners by convenience sampling with semi  structured, open ended interviews and discussions. The learning process, disease  diagnosis, treatment, remuneration, sharing of knowledge and socio-demographic  data was collected, analysed and discussed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty traditional practitioners were identified and  interviewed for the present study. These practitioners are locally known as  ""Vaidya"". The study revealed that the non-codified healthcare tradition is  practiced mainly by elderly persons in the age group of 61 years and above  (40%). 73% of the practitioners learnt the tradition from their forefathers, and  19% of practitioners developed their own practices through experimentation,  reading and learning. 20% of the practitioners follow distinctive ""Nadi  Pariksha"" (pulse examination) for disease diagnosis, while others follow bodily  symptoms and complaints. 29% of the traditional practitioners do not charge  anything, while 59% practitioners receive money as remuneration.Plant and animal  materials are used as sources of medicines, with a variety of preparation  methods. The preference ranking test revealed higher education and migration  from villages are the main reasons for decreasing interest amongst the younger  generation, while deforestation emerged as the main cause of medicinal plants  depletion. CONCLUSION: Patrilineal transfer of the knowledge to younger generation was  observed in Belgaum region. The observed resemblance in disease diagnosis, plant  collection and processing between non-codified traditional system of medicine  and Ayurveda require further methodical studies to establish the relationship  between the two on a more objective basis. However, the practice appears to be  at crossroads with threat of extinction, because of non-inheritance of the  knowledge and non-availability of medicinal plants. Hence conservation  strategies for both knowledge and resources at societal, scientific and  legislative levels are urgently required to preserve the traditional wisdom.","According to 'Non-codified traditional medicine practices from Belgaum Region in Southern India: present scenario', traditional medicine is still very much alive in India, especially in the Belgaum region. These practices, known as non-codified medicine, are typically passed down from generation to generation. The practitioners, often elderly folks, are known as ""Vaidya"". They diagnose diseases by checking your pulse or looking at symptoms and use plants and animal materials to make their remedies. Some of these practices are similar to Ayurveda, a type of traditional Indian medicine. However, the study found that fewer young people are interested in this type of medicine due to reasons like higher education and moving away from villages. Also, loss of medicinal plants due"
I've heard about Doshas in Ayurveda. How can I figure out my Dosha type to better understand my health?,"INTRODUCTION: The Ayurvedic theory of Tri-Dosha offers a unique framework for  understanding human differences in health and disease. The Doshas could be  readily applied in clinical studies to control for such differences the same way  sex, age, height and weight are routinely used except that clinical evaluation  is required and methods vary. No open-source questionnaire has been shown to be  reliable for self-assessment. Therefore, we undertook this study to develop a  reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire with characteristics suitable for  use in clinical research. METHODS: A review of published questionnaires and translations of classic  Ayurvedic texts along with an analysis of item-total correlations and ANOVAs by  Dosha for 735 responses to a 37-item ipsative questionnaire from an Ayurveda  products company served as the basis for generating 108 Dosha-specific test  items featuring a 7-point Likert scale. We used item-total and inter-item  correlations from a convenience sample of 176 individuals to identify the best  performing items. We then solicited repeat responses to the resultant 39-item  questionnaire (13 for each Dosha) from these and other website visitors and  calculated test-retest reliability as the intraclass correlation coefficient for  absolute agreement (ICC 2,1) for each Dosha. RESULTS: The final questionnaire gives normally distributed results. Among 76  self-selected adults, the test-retest reliabilities for Vata, Pitta and Kapha  Dosha scores are all above 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is possible to quantify the three  Doshas with adequate reliability for most clinical studies.","According to 'Development of a reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire', researchers have created a new questionnaire that helps people understand their health based on Ayurvedic principles. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medicinal system that believes every person has a unique balance of three energies, or Doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Just like we use factors like age, height, and weight to understand our health, this questionnaire can help account for differences in health and well-being based on your Dosha balance. The questionnaire was tested and tweaked to make sure it was reliable, and the results look promising. So, it's like a personality test for your health that could help you understand your body better!"
"I've heard of Ayurveda and Yoga, but not much about their role in public health. Can they really help with managing stuff like COVID-19?","There is a lot of discussion on COVID-19 control strategies from the mainstream  approaches, but it is also necessary to examine the contributions of the  Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Riga and Homeopathy (AYUSH)  sector, which is now being brought into public health interventions nationally.  Although the AYUSH sector had previously joined the management of dengue and  chikungunya outbreaks in some Indian states, its participation has remained  contentious and there is reluctance in mainstream public health discourses to  seriously examine their interventions. This is a commentary on the efforts made  by the Ministry of AYUSH, state AYUSH directorates, AYUSH research institutions,  and public hospitals, based on official documents as well as official statements  reported in the media, with the aim of bringing out concerns in the process of  adapting traditional textual knowledge and practices to public health  requirements of the current age.","According to 'AYUSH for COVID-19: Science or Superstition?', there's a lot of debate right now about how different health techniques, like those used in traditional Indian medicine, could help in managing COVID-19. These methods have been used in the past for other diseases like dengue and chikungunya. However, some people aren't sure if they really work or not. The government and various health organizations are trying to figure out how these traditional practices can be adapted to meet the needs of today's public health issues."
I've heard that chemotherapy and radiation treatments can really mess with your body. Are there any natural ways or home remedies to help handle these side effects?,"Chemotherapy drugs and radiotherapy are highly toxic and both damage adjacent  healthy cells. Side effects may be acute (occurring within few weeks after  therapy), intermediate or late (occurring months or years after the therapy).  Some important side effects of chemotherapy are: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  mucositis, alopecia, constipation etc; whereas radiation therapy though  administered locally, can produce systemic side effects such as fatigue,  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, alteration in the taste, sleep disturbance,  headache, anemia, dry skin, constipation etc. Late complications of these  therapies also include pharyngitis, esophagitis, laryngitis, persistent  dysphagia, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, infertility and cognitive deficits. These  arrays of side effects have a devastating effect on the quality of life of  cancer survivors. Due to the inadequacy of most of the radio-protectors and  chemo-protectors in controlling the side effects of conventional cancer therapy  the complementary and alternative medicines have attracted the view of  researchers and medical practitioners more recently. This review aims at  providing a comprehensive management protocol of above mentioned  chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects based on Ayurveda, which is an ancient  system of traditional medicine practiced in Indian peninsula since 5000 BC. When  the major side effects of chemo-radiotherapy are looked through an ayurvedic  perspective, it appears that they are the manifestations of aggravated pitta  dosha, especially under the group of disorders called Raktapitta (haemorrhage)  or Raktadushti (vascular inflammation). Based on comprehensive review of ancient  vedic literature and modern scientific evidences, ayurveda based interventions  are put forth. This manuscript should help clinicians and people suffering from  cancer to combat serious chemo-radiotherapy related side effects through simple  but effective home-based ayurveda remedies. The remedies described are commonly  available and safe. These simple ayurveda based solutions may act as an  important adjuvant to chemo-radiotherapy and enhance the quality of life of  cancer patients.","According to 'Ayurveda for chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects in cancer patients', cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause a lot of side effects. You might feel sick, lose your hair, feel tired all the time, or even have problems with your throat and stomach. These treatments can also lead to other issues like memory problems or fertility issues. Recently, researchers have been looking at traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, for help. They noticed that many of these side effects seem similar to what Ayurveda calls an imbalance of the ""pitta dosha"". The paper suggests that Ayurveda might offer some simple and safe home remedies to help manage these side effects, which could make life a bit easier for people going through"
"So, I've been hearing about this Ayurvedic thing where your health is all about balancing Vata, Pitta, and Kapha... can you explain it in simple terms? And like, how can I tell if mine are out of","In ayurvedic system of medicine, it is considered that a living system is made  of panch-mahabuta, in the form of Vata, pitta and kapha at the physical level  and satwa, raja and tama at the mental level. This covers the psychosomatic  constitution and commonly known as the Tridosh theory. The imbalance in these  body humours is the basic cause of any type of disease manifestation. Till date,  several objective parameters have been proposed to monitor the level of these  basic humours but none of them is complete. In this exercise, now it is proposed  to consider free radical theory of diseases as one of the objective parameters.  To be more specific, vata can be monitored in terms of membrane bound signal  transduction, pitta as the process of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of  different proteins (signalling moieties and enzymes) and kapha can be viewed as  the degree of gene expression as protein synthesis. This can be correlated with  the ojas of the body or total body defence mechanism.","According to 'Molecular approach to ayurveda', your body and mind are made up of different elements according to Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine. When these elements are not in balance, you might feel sick or out of sorts. The research proposes a new way to measure these elements. For instance, one of these elements, Vata, can be measured by seeing how signals are transmitted across your body's cells. Pitta can be gauged by the process of adding and removing phosphate groups from proteins in your body - think of it like turning switches on and off. And Kapha, another element, can be seen in how much your genes are expressing or producing proteins. All these can help us understand our body"
"So, I've heard that traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine believe diet can really affect your health. Can you explain some of their food recommendations and why they make them?","In some ancient systems of medicine, health was understood as a state of  balance, and diet was considered essential to achieving and maintaining that  balance. Traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda are based on this premise.  Here we present an overview of these two traditional systems' views on diet and  eating. This article aims to explain the reasoning behind some of the  recommendations that practitioners of these forms of medicine may be making.","According to 'Introduction to traditional Asian therapeutic diets: two enduring perspectives', traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine believe that what you eat is super important for keeping your health in check. It's like they're saying, ""You are what you eat."" So, if you've ever wondered why some folks recommend certain foods over others, it's because they're trying to create a balance in your body to keep you healthy."
"I've been using some Indian Ayurvedic remedies lately. Are there any risks I should know about, like heavy metal poisoning or something?","The popularity of traditional remedies has greatly increased in westernised  countries over recent years. Although many of these remedies are used safely,  there have recently been an increasing number of case reports being published of  heavy metal poisoning after the use of traditional remedies, in particular,  Indian Ayurvedic remedies. This study reviews the data on published cases, along  with the history of Ayurvedic medicine in an attempt to provide an insight into  why heavy metals, in particular lead, mercury and arsenic are added in such  large concentrations to these remedies.","According to 'A review of the clinical and toxicological aspects of 'traditional' (herbal) medicines adulterated with heavy metals', the use of traditional remedies, especially Indian Ayurvedic ones, is on the rise in Western countries. However, there's been an uptick in cases of heavy metal poisoning from these remedies. It seems they often have high amounts of heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic. So, if you're into herbal treatments, be careful and do some research before trying anything new."
"I've heard about this Ayurvedic medicine, cyavanaprāsh, that's supposed to boost your immune system. Is it legit, and where can I find it?","The paper discusses the many forms and representations of cyavanaprāsh,  Ayurveda's best-selling medicine, already mentioned in Caraka's Compendium (c.  200 CE). The medicine's compositions, applications, and meanings, change over  time and from locality to locality. Cyavanaprāsh is, for example, a patriotic  formula, a booster of the immune system, a modern geriatric drug, and one of the  elements in canonical Ayurvedic treatments. In the beginning of the 19th century  cyavanaprāsh was a patriotic formula for fortifying Indian bodies and the  nascent Indian nation. Nowadays the medicine is a Fast Moving Consumer Good  (FMCG) and a money maker for Dabur India Ltd., the world largest Ayurvedic  manufacturer. Instead of vitalising the nation its consumption now promises to  make urban middle class consumers effectively modern. Branding and modern  science must make Dabur Chyawanprash attractive in the eyes of these consumers.  Ayurveda and cyavanaprāsh are also part of a global counter culture marked by  neo-Orientalism and Ayurvedic medicines as facilitators of spirituality. The  marketing of cyavanaprāsh by India's largest Ayurvedic manufacturer is used as a  case study for discussing the proliferation of Ayurvedic brands and its critics.  The imaging of Ayurvedic brands such as Dabur Chyawanprash threatens to obscure  the fact that Ayurveda represents a unique way of looking upon health, disease  and the human body. The proliferation of brands also makes Ayurvedic medicines  more expensive and puts pressure on the natural environment as the main supplier  of Ayurvedic ingredients.","According to 'Assembling cyavanaprāsh, Ayurveda's best-selling medicine', cyavanaprāsh is a popular Ayurvedic medicine that's been around since around 200 CE. It's used for a bunch of different things and its use has changed over time and place. For example, it was once used as a symbol of Indian patriotism and to strengthen the people and the country. Nowadays, it's a big seller for Dabur India Ltd., the world's biggest maker of Ayurvedic stuff. It's now marketed as a way to help city-dwelling middle-class people feel more modern. The way it's marketed is part of a bigger global trend where Ayurvedic medicine is seen as a spiritual thing"
I've been using some Ayurvedic remedies recently. Should I be worried about any potential health risks?,"PURPOSE: We report a case of a 30 years old Indian sailor with microcytic anemia  (Hb 9.9), persistent abdominal pain, emesis, dark stool, hyperchromic urine,  latent jaundice and asthenia. Lead intoxication was confirmed (blood lead value  of 102 μg/dL). The patient assumed Ayurvedic medicines in the previous months.  Ayurveda is an ancient form of Indian traditional popular medicine aiming to  re-establish health and body function through herbal preparations, heavy metals  are often added. Our purpose was to treat the patient and to establish the  source of poisoning. METHODS: After testing blood and urine lead concentration of other 3 crew  members and analyzing over than 150 products used on the ship professional  exposure was excluded. We analyzed the two Ayurvedic drugs assumed by the  patient with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The patient  underwent three chelation cycles with Calcium Disodium  Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) while monitoring blood and urinary lead  levels. RESULTS: The final blood lead level at discharge, after three chelation cycles,  was 36.27 μg/dL. One of the two drugs contained extremely high concentrations of  lead and mercury. The three different mixtures of this preparation showed lead  concentrations of 12,638.54 mg/kg (Sample 2A), 23,043.02 mg/kg (Sample 2B),  21,352.97 mg/kg (Sample 2C); these levels are much higher than the highest  values reported in literature for the indian soil (32 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: This case and similar cases raise the safety alert on complementary  and alternative medicines; Ayurvedic medicine users should be carefully informed  about potential risks and signs of poisoning.","According to 'Lead poisoning from Ayurvedic treatment: a further case', a sailor got really sick after taking some traditional Indian medicine, called Ayurvedic medicine. This medicine sometimes has heavy metals like lead added to it. The doctors tested the guy and found out he had a lot of lead in his blood. They also found out that the medicine he took had a crazy amount of lead and mercury in it, way more than what's usually in the soil in India. After treating him for a while, they got his blood lead level down but this situation is a reminder that not all alternative medicines are safe. So, if you're using Ayurvedic or any kind of alternative medicine, make sure you know about the possible risks and signs of"
I've been using some ayurvedic remedies I found online. How can I be sure they're safe and not just loaded with alcohol?,"BACKGROUND: A large part of the population of India prefers the traditional  medicine (ayurvedic formulations) for primary health care. However, the  effective quality control of herbal medicine is still a big challenge. Numerous  reports indicate noncompliance with Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice  (GMP) guidelines by the manufacturers which may lead to adverse drug reactions  or toxic effects. Asava and arishta are the classical herbal dosage forms  wherein fermentation occurs during production leading to the generation of  ethanol. The presence of ethanol in these preparations may lead to their misuse.  The self-generated ethanol is responsible for extraction of active constituents  and acts as a self-preservative. As the procedure for preparation for asava and  arishta is same, the ethanol content is also expected to be the same  irrespective of the manufacturer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess and compare the  ethanol content of some traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations available  in the market. METHOD: In this study, 20 formulations from 3 different manufacturers available  as over-the-counter products were obtained and their ethanol contents were  determined using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were noted in the ethanol content  of various ayurvedic formulations. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and  validated gas chromatographic method for estimation of ethanol in fermented  ayurvedic formulations was also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSION: The data generated during study reflected poor compliance of GMP  guidelines by the manufacturers and hence the quality is being grossly  compromised posing a safety hazard.","According to 'Ethanol content in traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations: Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice regulations - compromised health', ayurvedic medicines, which are pretty popular in India, might have more alcohol content than they should. Some companies that make these traditional medicines aren't following the rules properly. This could be risky because too much alcohol in these medicines might be harmful. They checked 20 different products from 3 companies and found that the amount of alcohol in them varied a lot, which isn't a good sign."
"Is India's traditional medicine system really at risk of disappearing, and how might a different health policy help save it?",External pressures have combined to erode the practice of India's traditional  medical systems to such an extent that they are in danger of becoming extinct. A  better balanced national health policy could go a long way towards reversing  this trend.,"According to 'National health policy for traditional medicine in India', the traditional methods of Indian healthcare are at risk of disappearing due to various external pressures. However, having a better health policy in the country could help preserve these traditional practices."
"I've heard that some herbs might help with epilepsy, do you know if there's any truth to that?","Epilepsy, that comprises a wide spectrum of neuronal disorders and accounts for  about one percent of global disease burden affecting people of all age groups,  is recognised as apasmara in the traditional medicinal system of Indian  antiquity commonly known as Ayurveda. Towards exploring the molecular level  complex regulatory mechanisms of 63 anti-epileptic Ayurvedic herbs and  thoroughly examining the multi-targeting and synergistic potential of 349  drug-like phytochemicals (DPCs) found therein, in this study, we develop an  integrated computational framework comprising of network pharmacology and  molecular docking studies. Neuromodulatory prospects of anti-epileptic herbs are  probed and, as a special case study, DPCs that can regulate metabotropic  glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are inspected. A novel methodology to screen and  systematically analyse the DPCs having similar neuromodulatory potential  vis-à-vis DrugBank compounds (NeuMoDs) is developed and 11 NeuMoDs are reported.  A repertoire of 74 DPCs having poly-pharmacological similarity with  anti-epileptic DrugBank compounds and those under clinical trials is also  reported. Further, high-confidence PPI-network specific to epileptic  protein-targets is developed and the potential of DPCs to regulate its  functional modules is investigated. We believe that the presented schema can  open-up exhaustive explorations of indigenous herbs towards meticulous  identification of clinically relevant DPCs against various diseases and  disorders.","According to 'Insights about multi-targeting and synergistic neuromodulators in Ayurvedic herbs against epilepsy: integrated computational studies on drug-target and protein-protein interaction networks', researchers are looking into how certain herbs used in traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) could help treat epilepsy. They're using computer systems to study how these herbs interact with the body and specifically how they might help control seizures. The study found some promising leads, but more research is needed to fully understand how these plants can be used in epilepsy treatment."
I've been taking some ayurvedic medicines for a while now. Could they be the reason I've been feeling off lately?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, Indian traditional system of medicine, is practiced  commonly in South East Asia and in many parts of the world. Many ayurvedic drugs  contain heavy metals and may lead to metal toxicity. Of these, chronic lead  poisoning is the most common. Chronic arsenic poisoning following the use of  ayurvedic medication, though reported, is rare. CASE REPORTS: We describe three patients who presented with features of chronic  arsenic poisoning following prolonged ayurvedic medication use. The diagnosis of  chronic arsenic poisoning was confirmed by high arsenic levels in the blood,  urine, hair, and nails in all the three patients and in ayurvedic drug in two  patients. The ayurvedic medication was discontinued and treatment with  D-penicillamine started. At 6 months after treatment, blood arsenic levels  returned to normal with clinical recovery in all of them. CONCLUSION: Arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication is much less common  than lead poisoning, though mineral ayurvedic medicines may lead to it. We used  D-penicillamine as chelator and all of them recovered. Whether withdrawal of  medication alone or D-penicillamine also played a role in recovery is unclear  and needs to be assessed.","According to the study 'Chronic arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication', some traditional Indian medicines, known as Ayurvedic medicines, can actually make you sick if taken for a long time. This is because they might have heavy metals like arsenic in them. The researchers found three people who got seriously sick from arsenic poisoning after using these medicines for a while. The sickness was confirmed by finding high levels of arsenic in their blood and other body parts. They got better after they stopped taking the medicine and started a new treatment. It's not super clear if just stopping the medicine or the new treatment was what made them better. So if you're considering Ayurvedic medicines, maybe think twice and consult with a health professional before starting"
"I've been taking this Ayurveda Bhasma stuff for my stomach issues, but I heard it might be bad for my liver. Is that true?","Ayurveda Bhasma is a metallic-mineral preparation homogenised with herbal juices  or decoctions and modified with heat treatment to apparently detoxify the heavy  metals. It is widely recommended for the treatment of many disease conditions by  practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine in the absence of good  quality clinical trial evidence on its safety and efficacy. Heavy metal-induced  liver injury is widely reported in the literature, and heavy metal adulteration  of non-Bhasma-related Ayurveda and herbal products has been well described. We  report a patient who developed severe liver injury requiring listing for liver  transplantation for improved survival, after consumption of Bhasma for  dyspepsia. This case describes the first documented case and toxicology analysis  of Ayurveda Bhasma associated with severe drug-induced liver injury. Physicians  must be alert regarding patient's use of supposedly safe Ayurveda Bhasma that  may promote acute severe liver injury in the absence of other known aetiologies.","According to ""Ayurveda metallic-mineral 'Bhasma'-associated severe liver injury"", you should be careful with Ayurveda Bhasma, a type of traditional medicine. Despite claims that it can treat various illnesses, a guy who took it for his upset stomach ended up with severe liver damage and needed a liver transplant. So, even though it's marketed as a safe, natural treatment, it may not be as harmless as you think. Always check with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment."
"So, like, can my personality traits and physical quirks be used to predict how I might react to certain medicines or predict my health risks?","In Ayurveda system of medicine individuals are classified into seven  constitution types, ""Prakriti"", for assessing disease susceptibility and drug  responsiveness. Prakriti evaluation involves clinical examination including  questions about physiological and behavioural traits. A need was felt to develop  models for accurately predicting Prakriti classes that have been shown to  exhibit molecular differences. The present study was carried out on data of  phenotypic attributes in 147 healthy individuals of three extreme Prakriti  types, from a genetically homogeneous population of Western India. Unsupervised  and supervised machine learning approaches were used to infer inherent structure  of the data, and for feature selection and building classification models for  Prakriti respectively. These models were validated in a North Indian population.  Unsupervised clustering led to emergence of three natural clusters corresponding  to three extreme Prakriti classes. The supervised modelling approaches could  classify individuals, with distinct Prakriti types, in the training and  validation sets. This study is the first to demonstrate that Prakriti types are  distinct verifiable clusters within a multidimensional space of multiple  interrelated phenotypic traits. It also provides a computational framework for  predicting Prakriti classes from phenotypic attributes. This approach may be  useful in precision medicine for stratification of endophenotypes in healthy and  diseased populations.","According to 'Recapitulation of Ayurveda constitution types by machine learning of phenotypic traits', Ayurvedic medicine has a way to classify people into seven types, called ""Prakriti"". This helps determine how likely you are to get sick and how you might respond to medicines. A study was done to see if we can predict a person's Prakriti based on their physical and behavioural traits. The study found that people with similar traits often fell into the same Prakriti type when using machine learning. The researchers hope this could be used to customize treatments for individuals in the future, making them more effective."
I sneeze a lot and my nose is often stuffy. Could this be allergies and what natural remedies could work for me?,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an immune response of the nasal mucosa to  airborne allergens and involves nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge,  itching of the nose, and sneezing. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may  significantly affect a patient's quality of life and can be associated with  conditions such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, and sleep  disturbances. Various complementary and alternative medicine treatments have  been used for this condition in clinical practice. The Ayurveda system of  medicine is the most common complementary medicine system practiced in Sri  Lanka. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of a  decoction used in traditional Ayurveda for allergic rhinitis and its ready-  to-use freeze dried formulation in comparison to an antihistamine over a period  of 4 weeks on relief of symptoms in allergic rhinitis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a three-arm, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized  controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with AR. Tamalakyadi decoction  containing 12 ingredients (TMD12), used in traditional Ayurveda and its  freeze-dried formulation are the test products. The efficacy and safety of the  two Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the antihistamine loratadine.  Patients with symptoms of AR will be allocated randomly into the three arms  after a 1-week run-in period and the medications will be given orally for  28 days. Total Nasal symptom Score (TNSS) of the patients will be used as the  primary efficacy endpoint. TNSS will be recorded and compared between the three  arms prior to visit 1, at the end of 28 days, and end of the first and second  months of follow-up. Symptom scores of daytime nasal symptoms, night time nasal  symptoms, non-nasal symptoms and health-related quality of life questionnaire  are used as secondary end points. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will be able to provide evidence-based  scientific data on Ayurvedic dosage form, TMD12, and the freeze-dried  formulation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. This trial is expected to  develop capacity to scientifically evaluate various Ayurvedic treatments that  are claimed to have efficacy in treatment of various disease conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN18149439 (6 May 2019).","So, according to 'Efficacy and safety of two Ayurvedic dosage forms for allergic rhinitis: Study protocol for an open-label randomized controlled trial', researchers are looking at how Ayurvedic medicine, a type of traditional medicine used in Sri Lanka, can help people with hay fever. They're comparing two forms of this Ayurvedic remedy to an antihistamine, a common allergy medicine, to see which one is better at easing symptoms like a runny nose, sneezing, and itching. This study matters because it could provide scientific evidence showing that these Ayurvedic treatments are a safe and effective way to deal with hay fever."
"So, I heard ashwagandha might help with COVID-19, but does it mess with any other medical test results or anything like that?","OBJECTIVE: Ashwagandha, an Indian Ayurvedic medicine is indicated to prevent  COVID-19 infection. Because IL-6 and C-reactive protein are widely measured to  determine risk of cytokine storm in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we studied  potential interference of ashwagandha on these two assays. Previous studies  indicated that ashwagandha may interfere with digoxin assay, so we also studied  potential interference with digoxin assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained one ashwagandha product from India (liquid  extract) and one product from US (Herb Pharma; liquid extract). We prepared two  serum pool each for IL-6, C-reactive protein and digoxin by combining  appropriate left-over specimens submitted to our hospital laboratory for such  tests. Then aliquots of each pools were supplemented with 10, 25 or 50 µL of  ashwagandha extract followed by re-analysis for appropriate analyte and  comparing values with original pool. RESULTS: We observed negative interference of ashwagandha with IL-6 assay only  (Indian product showed more negative interference) but C-reactive protein assay  and digoxin assay were not affected. Negative interference of ashwagandha in  IL-6 assay has not been reported before. CONCLUSION: We conclude ashwagandha caused negative interference in IL-6 assay.","According to 'Technical Note: Negative Interference of Ashwagandha, an Indian Ayurveda Medicine Indicated for Preventing COVID-19, in IL-6 Immunoassay', ashwagandha (a herbal medicine from India) might mess with a specific test used to measure the severity of COVID-19 in patients. They found that it only disrupted the IL-6 test, but didn't affect the other two tests they looked at. This is the first time this kind of interference has been noted, so it's something to keep in mind if you're taking ashwagandha and end up needing these tests."
"I've heard about Ayurvedic medicine before, but it seems like it's not as popular anymore. Why did it decline in India and why is it still used by the poorer sectors?","In India, by the second century B.C., Ayurvedic medicine had already taken the  momentous step of becoming rational therapeutics. Physicians created a  methodology based on the supreme importance of direct observation of natural  phenomena and the technique of rational processing of empirical data. However,  over the long history of the country, Ayurvedic medicine underwent severe  erosion of its knowledge and practice because of profound political, cultural,  social, and economic changes. Nevertheless, it was used by the poor because  access to Western medicine was denied by the ruling classes. Alarm bells started  to ring with the declaration of self-reliance and self-determination by the poor  at Alma-Ata in 1978. A syndicate of the rich countries, with active support of  India's ruling elite, mobilized the enormous influence and resources of  organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Health  Organization, UNICEF, and World Bank to promote their unconcealed agenda of  promoting the private health sector and further decimating the public sector.","According to 'The political economy of the introduction of Western medicine in India and preexisting health practices', Ayurvedic medicine, which is an ancient Indian medical practice, was treated as second-class for a long time in India, especially by the rich and powerful. This happened because of big changes in politics, culture, society, and economy. Poor people, however, kept using it because they couldn't afford Western medicine. Things started to change when poor people began standing up for themselves in 1978. But instead of helping, powerful organizations from rich countries, with the support of India's elite, used their influence and money to boost private healthcare and weaken public healthcare."

I've been feeling super forgetful lately. Are there any natural remedies that might help boost my memory?,"Bacopa monnieri (L.) - (BM) is a perennial, creeping herb which is widely used  in traditional ayurvedic medicine as a neural tonic to improve intelligence and  memory. Research into the biological effects of this plant has burgeoned in  recent years, promising its neuroprotective and memory boosting ability among  others. In this context, an extensive literature survey allows an insight into  the participation of numerous signaling pathways and oxidative mechanism  involved in the mitigation of oxidative stress, along with other indirect  mechanisms modulated by bioactive molecules of BM to improve the cognitive  action by their synergistic potential and cellular multiplicity mechanism. This  multi-faceted review describes the novel mechanisms that underlie the unfounded  but long flaunted promises of BM and thereby direct a way to harness this  acquired knowledge to develop innovative approaches to manipulate its  intracellular pathways.","According to 'Neuropharmacological and cognitive effects of Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst - A review on its mechanistic aspects', Bacopa monnieri, a plant used in traditional medicine, might help to improve your memory and intelligence. Basically, it protects your brain and enhances its function. So, if you're looking for natural ways to boost your brainpower, this plant could be worth checking out."
Sometimes I wake up feeling super dizzy and nauseous. What could that mean?,"February 9, 2017. The alarm on my phone was set to a pre-dawn hour. We were to  leave for a holiday in the hills, a long drive that I had planned for days,  eager for hours of camaraderie with the steering wheel. But the waking was a  shock. The walls and ceiling of the room were swirling, my body felt as if  strapped to a rotating carnival wheel. Sitting, standing, walking, nothing eased  it. I threw up from the nausea. Maybe it will slow, maybe it will stop, maybe it  is nothing. It is vertigo, said my cousin (a doctor) on the phone, and  prescribed an over-the-counter medication. The world steadied. I made the drive,  the vacation, but the condition was now with me, for several hours each day.","According to 'My body is a lantern: Oscillopsia and an experience of Ayurveda', the author experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, a condition that makes you feel dizzy and off balance. Even though he managed to get through his vacation with the help of some medication, he still had to deal with these dizziness spells for several hours each day. So, if you ever wake up feeling like the room is spinning and you can't seem to shake it off, it might be vertigo. It's a good idea to reach out to a doctor who can suggest some over-the-counter medication to help manage the symptoms."
I've heard about this leech therapy thing in India. Could it actually be good for my health in any way?,"This article offers vascularity as a multi-dimensional imaginary for the  interspecies entanglements constituting Ayurvedic leech therapy. Whether, when,  where, and how a leech decides to bite, suck, and release comprise pivotal  junctures in leech therapy as practiced in southern Kerala, India. In the course  of leech-human intra-actions, leeches translate matter, providing sensory  mediation, relief, and amusement. Enmeshed in social and ecological relations  inflected by gender, religion, class, and caste, this analysis of Ayurvedic  leech therapy reframes questions of agencies starting with and from the  viewpoint of the vascular capacities of leeches in their interactions with  humans. This image of vascularity provides an analytic for the emergent agencies  of humans and leeches constituted by sensory intra-actions at branching points  in this multispecies clinical practice.","According to ""The Vascularity of Ayurvedic Leech Therapy: Sensory Translations and Emergent Agencies in Interspecies Medicine"", the use of leeches in traditional Indian medicine is a complex process where leeches play a vital role in the therapy. They basically help out by sucking out bad blood, giving a sense of relief, and oddly enough, some people even find it amusing. This practice is influenced by social factors like gender and class. The study basically wants to highlight the importance of these little creatures and how they interact with humans in this unusual medical practice."
"So, I've heard about this Ayurvedic medicine stuff. Does it have any tips on how to manage energy levels or something like that?","In classical Ayurvedic medicine, the jungle is the dry land of the Punjab and  the Delhi Doab, an open vegetation of thorny shrubs. The polarity of dry lands  and wet lands framed not only the whole Ayurvedic materia medica, but also the  more general conception of a cosmic physiology governed by Agni (the sun) and  Soma (the dispenser of the rain). Clearing the land and draining the body were  two aspects of one and the same art of managing the transactions of all sorts of  vital fluids, saps, juices, savors and humors. Medicine in the context of  thought and practice associated with the jungle was, and still is in modern  India, a kind of agriculture.","According to 'The jungle and the aroma of meats: an ecological theme in Hindu medicine', traditional Ayurvedic medicine is all about balance, kind of like making sure you have a good mix of different things in your life. It's based on the idea of keeping things in check, like making sure your body fluids are regulated right, just as you'd manage a garden or farm. This is why in India, they still see medicine as a type of 'health farming'. So, it's like ensuring you get enough sunshine (Agni) and rain (Soma) in your life for a healthy balance."
I've heard about this plant called Clerodendrum viscosum being used in traditional medicine. Do we know if it's safe to use or does it need more research?,"Clerodendrum viscosum is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions  of the world particularly in India. Extracts from different parts of the plant  have been used elaborately in Ayurveda and Unani for treating different illness.  Many phytochemicals were isolated from various parts of the plant, but their  pharmacological potentials have not been largely explored. This review focuses  on all these aspects of the plant keeping in view the cultural and traditional  acceptability of its medicinal use. Its toxicological data are limited and  require investigation to address for safety issues prior to recommendating for  pharmaceutical use.","According to the research paper 'Clerodendrum viscosum: traditional uses, pharmacological activities and phytochemical constituents', there's a plant called Clerodendrum viscosum that's pretty common in places like India. People have used different parts of this plant for ages in traditional medicine to treat various illnesses. There's a bunch of natural chemicals in the plant that could have health benefits, but we're not totally sure what all of them can do yet. The plant is generally accepted as a traditional medicine, but more research is needed to make sure it's safe before we start recommending it for use in modern medicine."
"Is there a natural remedy or plant that I could use to help with my skin problems, like they do in traditional Indian medicine?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional knowledge is a particular form of  practice or skill set that was developed in ancient times and was sustained  through generations via the passing of knowledge, essentially confined within a  specific tribe, local people, or family lineages. Ethnodermatological use of  medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if  there is chemical, microbiological, and/or clinical evidence, from a scientific  perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review  can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug  development. AIM OF THE STUDY: We compile and emphasize the most important part of  ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their  applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review  and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the  pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants  against problem skin diseases as well. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different kinds of key phrases such as ""Indian  traditional ethnodermatology"", ""ethnodermatology"", ""ethnobotany"", ""skin  diseases"", ""Ayurveda dermatology"", ""pharmacological activity"" were searched in  online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar  (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/),  PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository  (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained  from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary  shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants' uses have been found  across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities  of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against  particular skin diseases. RESULTS: The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian  subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin  disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is  topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the  pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice,  bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment  remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This  review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the  belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective  therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical  evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may  contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today,  ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new  practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will  further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of  natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand  for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on  plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be  intensified.","According to 'Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India: From ayurvedic formulations to clinical perspectives - A review', old-school remedies and tips about skincare, passed down through generations in India, are actually pretty effective at treating a bunch of skin issues. They studied a lot of plants and found that many of them do have the power to help with skin problems. However, they still need to do more research to prove that these treatments are scientifically solid. But, it's a good start to finding new, natural ways to keep our skin healthy, which is awesome because a lot of people prefer natural, sustainable options nowadays. So, don't discount grandma's weird plant-based skincare remedy just yet, it might just work!"
"So, there's this traditional Indian medicine thing called Ayurveda that's based on body types or something. Can my genes determine what type I am?","The practice of Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, is based on the  concept of three major constitutional types (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) defined as  ""Prakriti"". To the best of our knowledge, no study has convincingly correlated  genomic variations with the classification of Prakriti. In the present study, we  performed genome-wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis (Affymetrix,  6.0) of 262 well-classified male individuals (after screening 3416 subjects)  belonging to three Prakritis. We found 52 SNPs (p ≤ 1 × 10(-5)) were  significantly different between Prakritis, without any confounding effect of  stratification, after 10(6) permutations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of  these SNPs classified 262 individuals into their respective groups (Vata, Pitta  and Kapha) irrespective of their ancestry, which represent its power in  categorization. We further validated our finding with 297 Indian population  samples with known ancestry. Subsequently, we found that PGM1 correlates with  phenotype of Pitta as described in the ancient text of Caraka Samhita,  suggesting that the phenotypic classification of India's traditional medicine  has a genetic basis; and its Prakriti-based practice in vogue for many centuries  resonates with personalized medicine.","According to 'Genome-wide analysis correlates Ayurveda Prakriti', Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine practice, uses a system called ""Prakriti"" with three types: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. This study basically looked into the DNA of people classified under these three types and found certain DNA differences or markers unique to each type. This suggests there's a genetic basis to these categories in Ayurveda, which is pretty cool considering it has been around for centuries. It's almost like Ayurveda was doing personalized medicine way before it became a thing in modern science!"
My grandma is diabetic and she's been trying out Ayurveda treatments. What can I do to make sure she's understanding her health right?,"Older Indian diabetics lack proper health literacy making them vulnerable to  complications. Assessment of health literacy was done by hospital-based  cross-sectional study. Face-to-face interview was conducted by pretested  structured questionnaires. Diabetes patients aged ≥60 years consisted of 56.22%  males and 43.78% females; in addition, 34.2% respondents were without formal  schooling. Diabetes was known to 63.56% respondents. Total knowledge and  practice score of the respondents was good (18.9% and 35.1%), average (30.7% and  46.9%), and poor (50.4% and 18%), respectively. Knowledge and practice score was  strongly associated ( P < .01) with religion, educational status, and diabetes  duration with positive relationship ( R2 = 0.247, P < .01) between knowledge and  practice score. The study highlights lack of health literacy among older  diabetics undergoing ayurveda management. Baseline statistics will pave the way  toward ayurpharmacoepidemiology.","According to 'Ayurpharmacoepidemiology Perspective: Health Literacy (Knowledge and Practice) Among Older Diabetes Patients Visiting Ayurveda Teaching Hospitals in India', many older people in India with diabetes don't know enough about their health condition, which could lead to more problems. The research shows that this lack of knowledge is linked with their religion, level of education, and how long they've had diabetes. However, there's hope as the researchers believe that these findings can help improve the way we use traditional Indian medicine to treat diabetes."
"My skin gets really dry, especially in the winter. Are there any natural oils I could use as a moisturizer?","Vegetable oils have been used for a wide variety of purposes since time  immemorial; however, their principle use remains as skin moisturizers,  especially in neonates and children. Because of their considerable efficacy and  a low side effect profile and bearable cost, these oils are hugely popular as  moisturizers among the common people in countries such as India. A wide variety  of oils have been used, and newer ones are coming up with each passing day. This  article focuses on the different types of vegetable oils and their varied uses  in dermatology.","According to 'Use of vegetable oils in dermatology: an overview', vegetable oils are pretty awesome for your skin. They've been used for ages to keep skin moisturized, especially in babies and kids. They're popular because they work well, don't have a lot of side effects, and won't break the bank. Plus, there's a whole bunch of different ones you can try out, and new ones are popping up all the time. So, if you're looking for a simple and natural way to take care of your skin, vegetable oils might be worth a shot."
"I've heard about Traditional Chinese Medicine, but did other cultures like India also influence it?","Since the sea route between China and all countries in the Western Region was  unimpeded, many Buddhist monks came to China. Some of them settled in Lingnan  Region. With them, Indian medicine was imported which greatly expanded the  coverage of TCM. Some of the Northerners moved southward into Lingnan Region and  contracted beriberi which were cured by Indian monks. The author explores the  importation of Indian medcine through analysis of beriberi as an example.","According to 'Introduction of Indian medicine into China in the Wei-Jin-Southern-Northern dynasties as interpreted by beriberi', when Buddhist monks traveled from India to China, they brought their knowledge of medicine with them. This helped to increase the range and variety of Traditional Chinese Medicine. For instance, when some people moved to the southern region of Lingnan and got sick with beriberi, these Indian monks were able to cure them."
"I've heard about Ayurvedic Bhasmas being used as a type of natural medicine. Are they really safe to use, even though they have metals and stuff in them?","In this paper, we present an overview of Ayurvedic Bhasmas as nanomedicine of  herbo-metallic and mineral origin with particular attention to their structural  aspects. We find, the Bhasmas as nanomedicines may offer a huge potential for  designing new drugs employing the concept of nanotechnology. Thus, the  standardization of fabrication process of these formulations is a crucial issue  to be addressed. The structure and effectiveness of the Bhasmas as drugs depend  largely on their processing history. Bhasmas are generally safe drugs for human  beings in spite of the presence of seemingly toxic elements and compounds as  indicated by recent studies using modern analytical techniques. Nevertheless,  more systematic nanomaterialistic investigations on Bhasmas are recommended for  gaining the complete and reliable composition-processing-structure-effectiveness  picture of these drugs.","According to 'Ayurvedic Bhasmas: overview on nanomaterialistic aspects, applications, and perspectives', Bhasmas are a type of medicine used in Ayurveda that are made from plants, metals, and minerals. These could be a big deal in developing new drugs because they are similar to nanotechnology, a super tiny technology that can interact with our bodies in awesome ways. However, making these Bhasmas just right is super important for them to work properly as medicines. Even though they might have some elements and compounds that seem harmful, recent studies show they are generally safe for us to use. Still, the paper encourages more research to fully understand what's in them, how they're made, and how effective they can be"
I've heard that stress can impact male fertility. Is this true and are there any natural remedies that could help?,"Infertility is a universal health problem affecting 15% of couples, out of which  20-30% cases are due to male infertility. The leading causes of male infertility  include hormonal defects, physical reasons, sexual problems, hazardous  environment, stressful lifestyle, genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and  oxidative stress. Various physiological functions involve reactive oxygen  species (ROS) and nitrogen species at appropriate levels for proper smooth  functioning. ROS control critical reproductive processes such as capacitation,  acrosomal reaction, hyperactivation, egg penetration, and sperm head  decondensation. The excessive free radicals or imbalance between ROS and  endogenous antioxidant enzymes damages sperm membrane by inducing lipid  peroxidation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage that eventually  lead to male infertility. Numerous synthetic products are available in the  market to treat infertility problems, largely ending in side effects and  repressing symptoms. Ayurveda contains a particular group of Rasayana herbs,  called vajikarana, that deals with nourishment and stimulation of sexual  tissues, improves male reproductive vitality, and deals with oxidative stress  via antioxidant mechanism. The present study aims to describe oxidative stress  and the role of herbal drugs in treating male infertility.","According to 'Oxidative Stress and Male Infertility: Role of Herbal Drugs', infertility can affect guys too, not just women. It can be caused by a lot of things like stress, unhealthy lifestyle, and even your genes. Sometimes, your body creates too much of something called ""reactive oxygen species"" which can mess up your sperm and lead to infertility. There are a ton of artificial products out there that claim to fix these issues, but they might cause side effects or just hide the problem. The study suggests using certain herbs from Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine system, could be a better way to improve male fertility. These herbs could help by boosting your sexual health and balancing out those ""reactive oxygen species""."

I've heard of this plant called Bacopa monnieri that's supposed to help with focus and memory. Is it safe for someone my age to use?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinicians utilise critical research to advance their knowledge when  prescribing standard and alternative therapies for developmental disorders.  Recent research has reported that the traditional Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa  monnieri may improve cognitive outcomes in adult populations; however, few  studies have investigated its benefits in younger cohorts. The aim of the  current review is to systematically assess and critically summarize clinical  trial outcomes and safety of Bacopa and its effects on the cognition and  behaviour in children and adolescents. METHOD: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google and CINAHL were searched up to  August 2015 for trials investigating Bacopa monnieri in child and adolescent  populations. There were no restrictions in study design. Cognitive and  behavioural outcomes were grouped into validated constructs and effect sizes  were calculated for all significant data to allow for direct comparisons. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria for this review. The results  demonstrated significant consistent improvements in the language behaviour  cognitive domain and in a number of the memory sub-domains. Significant  improvements were also seen in hyperactivity and attention-deficit domains.  Overall outcome data demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (mean d=0.42).  Safety and tolerability data was well reported for 80% of studies with only 2.3%  of all participants reporting mild side-effects. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the safe use of Bacopa monnieri in child and  adolescent populations for improving elements of cognition as well as behaviour  and attention-deficit domains. However, there is a significant need for  replicated study designs and stringent statistical analysis to validate these  outcomes.","According to 'A systematic review of the Ayurvedic medicinal herb Bacopa monnieri in child and adolescent populations', Bacopa monnieri, a plant used in traditional Indian medicine, might help improve memory, language skills, and behavior issues like hyperactivity and attention deficit in kids and teenagers. The studies also showed it's pretty safe to use, with only a few people reporting mild side effects. But, just to be on the safe side, more research needs to be done to confirm these benefits."
I've been thinking about trying out some Ayurvedic remedies I found online. Are there any risks I should be aware of?,Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient and traditional system of health care. It is  safe but inadvert and unsupervised use can lead to serious health complications.  Lead is a common constituent of these medicines. Here authors describe two cases  of lead encephalopathy as a result of long-term ayurvedic medication intake.  First case was a 54-year-old female taking ayurvedic medications since long time  presented with acute confusional state and memory disturbances with abdominal  pain. MRI brain showed symmetric basal ganglia and cortical signal changes and  edema with significantly elevated lead levels in blood. She responded to  chelation therapy with oral penicillamine with complete clinical and  radiological resolution. Second case presented was a 45-year female taking  ayurvedic medications for hypertension presented with headaches and rapid  deterioration in sensorium leading to coma and death. MRI brain showed diffuse  cerebral edema with basal ganglia signal changes with elevated lead levels in  blood. These two cases highlight the need for increased awareness that some  Ayurvedic medicines may contain potentially harmful levels of lead and people  who use them are at risk of developing associated toxicity which can even be  fatal.,"According to 'Acute Lead Encephalopathy Secondary to Ayurvedic Medication Use: Two Cases with Review of Literature', using traditional Ayurvedic medicines without proper guidance can sometimes be dangerous. In this research, two women got seriously sick and one even died because their medicine had too much lead in it. So, if you're thinking about using Ayurvedic remedies, make sure you talk to a professional first and remember that just because something is natural doesn't mean it's always safe."
"I've heard a bit about this Ayurveda thing and how it's related to our health. How does my body's bacteria play into this, and could it be affecting how I feel day-to-day?","Ayurveda is one of the ancient systems of medicine which is widely practised as  a personalized scientific approach towards the general wellness. Ayurvedic  prakriti is broadly defined as the phenotypes which are determined on the basis  of physical, psychological and physiological traits irrespective of their  social, ethnic, dietary and geographical stature. Prakriti is the constitution  of a person, which comprises vata, pitta, and kapha and is a key determinant of  how one individual is different from the other. Human microbiome is considered  the 'latest discovered' human organ and microbiome research reiterates the  fundamental principles of Ayurveda for creating a healthy gut environment by  maintaining the individual-specific microbiome. Hence, it is important to  understand the association of human microbiome with the Ayurvedic prakriti of an  individual. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of human microbiome from  the gut, oral and skin samples of healthy individuals (n=18) by 16S rRNA  gene-based metagenomics using standard QIIME pipeline. In the three different  prakriti samples differential abundance of Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio,  Parabacteroides, Slackia, and Succinivibrio was observed in the gut microbiome.  Analysis also revealed prakriti-specific presence of Mogibacterium,  Propionibacterium, Pyramidobacter, Rhodococcus in the kapha prakriti individuals  Planomicrobium, Hyphomicrobium, Novosphingobium in the pitta prakriti  individuals and Carnobacterium, Robiginitalea, Cetobacterium, Psychrobacter in  the vata prakriti individuals. Similarly, the oral and skin microbiome also  revealed presence of prakriti-specific differential abundance of diverse  bacterial genera. Prakriti-specific presence of bacterial taxa was recorded and  only 42% microbiome in the oral samples and 52% microbiome in the skin samples  were shared. Bacteria known for preventing gut inflammation by digesting the  resistant starch were abundant in the pitta prakriti individuals, who are more  prone to develop gut-inflammation-related disorders. In summary, human gut, oral  and skin microbiome showed presence or high abundance of few bacterial taxa  across three prakriti types, suggesting their specific physiological importance.","According to 'Understanding the association between the human gut, oral and skin microbiome and the Ayurvedic concept of prakriti', Ayurveda, an ancient wellness practice, suggests that we're all unique based on our physical, mental, and bodily traits, which they call 'prakriti.' This study found that our personal mix of gut, mouth, and skin bacteria (our microbiome) is linked to these Ayurvedic types. They found that different types have different amounts and types of bacteria. For instance, people who are more likely to have gut inflammation, according to Ayurveda, actually have more of the bacteria that help to prevent this. So, this research basically confirms that Ayurveda's got a point"
I've heard natural remedies can help with managing diabetes. Are there any specific plants from India that have been proven to help with this?,"Since ancient times, plants have been an exemplary source of medicine. Ayurveda  and other Indian literature mention the use of plants in treatment of various  human ailments. India has about 45000 plant species and among them, several  thousands have been claimed to possess medicinal properties. Research conducted  in last few decades on plants mentioned in ancient literature or used  traditionally for diabetes have shown anti-diabetic property. The present paper  reviews 45 such plants and their products (active, natural principles and crude  extracts) that have been mentioned/used in the Indian traditional system of  medicine and have shown experimental or clinical anti-diabetic activity. Indian  plants which are most effective and the most commonly studied in relation to  diabetes and their complications are: Allium cepa, Allium sativum, Aloe vera,  Cajanus cajan, Coccinia indica, Caesalpinia bonducella, Ficus bengalenesis,  Gymnema sylvestre, Momordica charantia, Ocimum sanctum, Pterocarpus marsupium,  Swertia chirayita, Syzigium cumini, Tinospora cordifolia and Trigonella foenum  graecum. Among these we have evaluated M. charantia, Eugenia jambolana, Mucuna  pruriens, T. cordifolia, T. foenum graecum, O. sanctum, P. marsupium, Murraya  koeingii and Brassica juncea. All plants have shown varying degree of  hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic activity.","According to 'Medicinal plants of India with anti-diabetic potential', many plants in India have been used as traditional medicine for various health issues, including diabetes. There are 45 plants in particular that have been studied and show promise in helping to manage blood sugar levels. Some of these include aloe vera, garlic, onion, and others. So, adding these plants into your diet or health regimen could possibly help control your blood sugar if you're dealing with diabetes. Just like swapping soda for water might clear up your skin, using these plants might help manage your diabetes."
"So, I've heard about people using Ayurveda and homeopathy for skin problems, but this sounds like there are some issues with that in India. Is it safe to use these alternative medicines for skin care or should I stick to dermatologist-re","Alternative medicinal systems like Ayurveda and homeopathy are respected and  legitimate sciences. The former was born in India. Colleges abound in this  country churning out tens of thousands of graduates of these fields. It is  ironic that a large number of them pratice allopathic general practice instead  of, or along with, their field of specialisation despite laws prohibiting them  to do so. Their gross lack of knowledge of dermatology wreaks a havoc. Even GPs  contribute to this confusion for the same reason. Pharmacists contribute to  unauthorised sale of dermatologic drugs and promote unsupervised treatment  flouting the law. The result is neglected and vitiated dermatoses, unwanted  adverse drug reactions and resource depletion for the patient. The practising  dermatologist in India is unfortunately the one who bears the brunt of the above  confusion. However these situations are also contributory to the enviable  clinical skills that Indian dermatologists are so well known for.","According to 'Effect of alternative medicinal systems and general practice', there seems to be a bit of a problem in India with people trained in alternative medicine like Ayurveda and homeopathy choosing to practice mainstream medicine instead. The issue is, they don't always have the right knowledge to do this properly, especially when it comes to skin conditions. This is leading to people not getting the right treatment and experiencing bad reactions to medications. It's a bit of a mess, but on the bright side, it seems to be making Indian dermatologists really good at their jobs because they're dealing with all this chaos."
Why do people in Sri Lanka seem to be using less Ayurveda treatments and more western medicine these days?,"Sri Lanka has had a pluralist health care system for centuries, in which Western  biomedicine coexists with the Ayurveda system. However, recent studies suggest a  declining trend in the use of the Ayurveda system. This study provides insights  into the reasons for the low utilization of the Ayurveda system at present. The  study findings reveal that low utilization of the Ayurveda system can be  attributed to several factors, including the quick effect of Western medicines,  the perception of being accustomed to Western medicines, a lack of competent  Ayurveda practitioners, the high cost and low quality of Ayurveda medicines, and  the rapidly changing lifestyles of villagers. However, for certain conditions  such as fractures, snakebite, and paralysis, the majority of the Sri Lankan  population still uses Ayurveda treatment. In conclusion, we suggest that health  authorities should take into account these changes for future health planning in  Sri Lanka.","According to 'Paradox in treatment seeking: an experience from rural Sri Lanka', fewer people in Sri Lanka are using Ayurveda, a traditional form of medicine, than before. The reasons for this are that Western medicine works faster, people are already used to it, and there aren't enough skilled Ayurveda doctors. Also, Ayurveda medicines can be expensive and not always of good quality. People's lifestyles are also changing quickly. But, some people still use Ayurveda for things like broken bones, snake bites, and paralysis. The paper suggests that Sri Lanka's health authorities should think about these changes when planning for the future."
"So, I've been hearing a lot about this Ayurveda thing from India. Can it help me get healthier and maybe deal with my stress better?","Ayurveda, the indigenous holistic healing system of India, is a holistic  approach to health and lifestyle management that incorporates diet, exercise,  life activity routines, psychotherapeutic practices, massage and botanical  medicine. Ayurveda focuses on prevention, applying techniques of self-care to  restore health balance quickly and effectively. Ayurveda is one of the four  large, long-practiced ethnic herbal medicine systems with large extant  literatures (along with Western, Chinese and Unani). It affords valuable  clinical insights in its own right. Acquiring a basis in Ayurveda will enhance  access to south Asian herbs and indigenous medicinal preparations.","According to 'The practitioner's perspective: introduction to Ayurvedic herbalism', Ayurveda is a traditional Indian approach to staying healthy that includes things like diet, exercise, daily routines, mental health practices, massages and using plants as medicine.

I've heard that ancient cultures like the Hindus had some cool health practices. Is there anything useful we can learn from them today?,"Until the close of the eighteen century the western world remained ignorant of  the ancient Hindu culture, in spite of early achievements found in the ancient  Greek philosophy, in the Arabic translations and in the Italian Renassaince. The  reason was that Hindu traditions were oraly transmitted and the records, written  exclusively in Sanskrit, were incomplete. The European scholars and philogists  evoked a late interest in Hindic studies, but for many years the dispute has  been confined for scientific Medicine to a question of priority. By going  through the Sucruta Samhita in the English translation of K. L. Bhishagratna one  can afford to say that Sushruta has in many way not been a pupil of western  culture but an original thinker.","According to 'Sucruta Samhita: an original chapter of surgery or an interdependence of values in the history of medicine?', the ancient Hindu culture had some seriously cool knowledge that the Western world didn't know about until the 1800s. This was mainly because their traditions were passed down verbally, and any records they did write were incomplete and in Sanskrit. European scholars eventually got interested in studying this stuff, but there's been a lot of debate about who figured out what first. After looking at an English translation of the Sushruta Samhita, it seems like Sushruta wasn't just copying Western ideas but was actually a pretty original thinker."
"I've been taking these herbal supplements for a while, but I'm not sure if they're legit. Is there a way to know if they actually contain the plants they say they do?","INTRODUCTION: Ayurveda takes advantage of the beneficial properties of medicinal  plants. High demands in combination with inadequate availability of botanicals  and a lack of knowledge with respect to their precise identification lead to  adulterations in herbal products. Identification becomes more difficult in  complex herbal formulations. Four different polyherbal formulations have been  analyzed for the present paper. The targeted plants have different  pharmacological properties for various ailments. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the rbcL gene based plant DNA mini-barcode to  identify target and non-target plants in polyherbal formulations by using  high-throughput next generation sequencing. METHODS: Degenerate primers of the selected mini-barcode region have been  identified from the literature. A blend of 30 authentic medicinal plant species  was used to examine the species resolution capacity of the mini-barcode. DNA was  isolated from herbal formulations, an amplicon library was prepared, and  sequencing was performed on an IonS5 system. Data were analyzed using various  bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Analysis of control pooled samples revealed the optimum resolving power  of the DNA mini-barcode. Data analysis of the commercial samples revealed that  only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed  contents. In two formulations, only 10 out of 21 and 11 out of 20 plants were  detected, respectively. Additionally, several non-listed plants were also  detected in these formulations. Two formulations contained >20% reads assigned  to non-target plants. Overall, 21.98% of the reads were assigned to non-target  plants. CONCLUSION: The present study clearly demonstrated the successful application  and potential of meta-barcoding in the quality control of complex herbal  matrices. The results strongly suggest that this approach can be used in  pharmacovigilance of processed herbal products.","According to 'DNA meta-barcoding using rbcL based mini-barcode revealed presence of unspecified plant species in Ayurvedic polyherbal formulations', scientists have found a way to check what's really in our herbal supplements. They use a kind of DNA fingerprinting to find out what plants are in these products. They tested four different herbal mixtures and found that only one had all the plants it said it would. Two of the others had half the plants they listed, and they all had some plants that weren't listed at all. So, next time you're buying herbal supplements, remember that they might not be what they seem."
"I've heard that Ayurveda and Yoga can be used to treat COVID-19, is that true? And can it also help with other health issues like diabetes or high blood pressure?","BACKGROUND: We report a high-risk case of a coronavirus disease 19  (COVID-19)-positive patient with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM),  hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease (CKD), treated  successfully using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga, along  with government-mandated compulsory modern western medicine (MWM) treatment.  Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment  of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita  and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions  and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities,  along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi,  India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before  seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN,  hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was  resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough,  body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based  on the patient's symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including  Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle  modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga  consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms  within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately [Formula:  see text] relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief  within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar [FBS] and  postprandial blood sugar [PPBS]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days,  and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in  symptoms, the patient's real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the  symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a  significant improvement in blood sugar levels (not under control with modern  medicine) was also achieved. Integrative therapy based on the classical texts of  Ayurveda and Yoga may offer a promising and scalable treatment option for  COVID-19 patients. A case series or a suitably designed randomized controlled  trial is needed to assess its efficacy.","According to 'The use of integrative therapy based on Yoga and Ayurveda in the treatment of a high-risk case of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with multiple comorbidities: a case report', a 55-year-old man in Delhi who caught COVID-19 and also had diabetes, high blood pressure, underactive thyroid, and kidney issues, got better using a mix of traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda), yoga, and regular Western medicine.

I heard about this stuff called Shilajit that's supposed to be good for your health. Is there any real proof that it works or is it just hype?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shilajit is a multi-component natural occurring  mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine which  originated in India. Its source can be traced to the mountainous regions, where  the hilly tribes first identified its beneficial use. Shilajit is aptly referred  to as 'rasayana'/'rasayanam' in Ayurveda and Siddha literature which means  rejuvenator because it prevents ailment and enhances the quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An attempt has been put forth to review shilajit  pertaining to its origin, synonyms, varieties, physical properties, chemical  constituents, therapeutic properties and important biological properties to  affirm its rasayana property. All relevant information on shilajit was collected  from classical texts including pharmacopoeias, formularies, etc. Moreover,  select doctoral thesis from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Gujarat  Ayurved University, Jamnagar were also scanned. Published papers on shilajit  were collected from important databases for biomedical sciences. Amongst, the  various biological properties of shilajit, antioxidant activity and  immuno-modulatory activity were focused as it is closely related to its rasayana  potential. RESULTS: This review finds that shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations  and twenty-four proprietary drugs for extraneous indications. Even-though, there  is a long history of use of shilajit in traditional Indian materia medica,  shilajit unfortunately lacks scientific evaluation and systematic documentation.  In vivo antioxidant activity of shilajit has been studied at an irrelevant dose  and without using a positive control. The immuno-modulatory activity does not  stand the test of critical assessment and currently may be considered as  unproven. CONCLUSION: Based on the earlier studies, the bioactivity of shilajit lacks  substantial evidence. Nevertheless, further studies are imperative to overcome  the lacuna in establishing the antioxidant property of shilajit and more  specific assays are needed to vouch shilajit as an immuno-modulator which may be  of use to establish its rasayana potential.","According to the 'Review on shilajit used in traditional Indian medicine', Shilajit is a natural substance found in the mountains that has a long history of use in Indian medicine for its potential health benefits. It's often referred to as a 'rejuvenator' because it's thought to enhance life quality and prevent diseases. However, the science behind these benefits is still a bit sketchy and more research is needed to fully understand how it works and whether it can live up to its reputation."
"I've heard that certain plants can help with inflammation and even Parkinson's disease. Is there any truth to that, like maybe this Mucuna pruriens I heard about?","Immune control is associated with nigrostriatal neuroprotection for Parkinson's  disease (PD); though its direct cause and effect relationships have not yet been  realized and modulating the immune system for therapeutic gain has been openly  discussed. While the pathobiology of PD remains in study, neuroinflammation is  thought to speed nigrostriatal degeneration. The neuroinflammatory cascade  associated with PD begins with aggregation of misfolded or post-translationally  modified α-synuclein (α-syn). Such aggregation results in neuronal cell death  and the presence of chronically activated glia (microglia and astroglia),  leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis  factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and enzymes such as  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2). These changes in the glial phenotype can affect the central nervous  system (CNS) microenvironment by producing a pro-inflammatory milieu that speeds  PD pathogenesis. Mucuna pruriens (Mp) is the most popular drug in Ayurveda, the  Indian system of medicine. Several reports have suggested that it possesses  analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-epileptic and anti-microbial  activities. Mp contain L-DOPA and ursolic acid which has an anti-inflammatory  property. There are very few literatures which show the immunomodulatory  activity of Mp in PD, several researchers have tried to work on the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in some other diseases. The results of several  studies show that Mp modulate the immune components like TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-λ,  IL-1β, iNOS and IL-2 in the CNS. It also modulates the activity of the  transcription factor NF-kB which plays an important role in the progression of  the PD. Thus, by altering these cytokines or transcription factors, Mp protects  or prevents the progression of PD. Thus in this review we try to explore the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in PD.","According to 'Immunomodulation of Parkinson's disease using Mucuna pruriens (Mp)', Parkinson's disease, a condition that affects the brain and can cause shaking and stiffness, might be influenced by your immune system. When bad proteins build up in the brain, it can cause inflammation and damage. Some scientists think this process might speed up the disease. Mucuna pruriens, a plant often used in traditional Indian medicine, might have the power to change this. The plant has substances that can calm down inflammation and alter how the immune system works in the brain. So, it might be able to slow down the progression of Parkinson's disease. More research is needed, but it's a promising start!"
"I've heard of this ""Amchi System"" from India, do you know what it involves and how it might help improve my health?","The paper presents a detailed study of an ancient medical system of the Old  World. The system, popularly known as the ""Amchi System"", has a large following  in Ladakh or Little Tibet (India) and has been practised for centuries. The  system resembles, in some broad aspects, the Ayurvedic system but has its own  characteristics. It makes use of minerals, hot water springs, puncturing of  veins, branding, and herbs. Some of the herbs used by local medical  practitioners, popularly known as ""Amchis"" are also described. Uses of most of  the herbs are reported here for the first time.","According to the 'Medicinal system of Ladakh, India', there's this old-school health care system from a place in India called Ladakh that a lot of people still use. It's called the ""Amchi System"" and while it's a bit like Ayurveda (another traditional Indian health care method), it's got its own unique stuff going on. They use things like minerals, hot spring water, and even different types of herbs. This is the first time we're hearing about what some of these herbs can do. It's pretty cool to see how these old traditions are still helping people stay healthy today."
I've been super stressed lately and it's really affecting my stomach. Are there any natural remedies that could help with this?,"Withania somnifera (Ashawagandha) is very revered herb of the Indian Ayurvedic  system of medicine as a Rasayana (tonic). It is used for various kinds of  disease processes and specially as a nervine tonic. Considering these facts many  scientific studies were carried out and its adaptogenic / anti-stress activities  were studied in detail. In experimental models it increases the stamina of rats  during swimming endurance test and prevented adrenal gland changes of ascorbic  acid and cortisol content produce by swimming stress. Pretreatment with Withania  somnifera (WS) showed significance protection against stress induced gastric  ulcers. WS have anti-tumor effect on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell carcinoma.  It was also found effective against urethane induced lung-adenoma in mice. In  some cases of uterine fibroids, dermatosarcoma, long term treatment with WS  controlled the condition. It has a Cognition Promoting Effect and was useful in  children with memory deficit and in old age people loss of memory. It was also  found useful in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and  Alzeimer's diseases. It has GABA mimetic effect and was shown to promote  formation of dendrites. It has anxiolytic effect and improves energy levels and  mitochondrial health. It is an anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic agent and  was found useful in clinical cases of Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritis. Large scale  studies are needed to prove its clinical efficacy in stress related disorders,  neuronal disorders and cancers.","According to 'An overview on ashwagandha: a Rasayana (rejuvenator) of Ayurveda', ashwagandha is a super cool herb used in Indian medicine that can help you deal with stress and boost your energy levels. It's even been studied for its potential to protect against different diseases and health issues. For example, in tests, it helped rats swim longer and it also seemed to shield them from stress-related changes in their bodies. It's also shown promise in fighting certain types of cancer cells and might even be useful in treating some memory and nerve disorders. But don't forget, while these results sound promising, we still need more large-scale studies to fully understand how it works and how to best use"
"So, Ayurveda is pretty big in Kerala, huh? I've been feeling a bit stressed and off balance lately. Could Ayurvedic practices help me feel better, or is it just about the medicines?","Ethnographic inquiry into Ayurvedic commodification in Kerala revealed the  prevalence of a distinct regional pharmaceutical market dominated by  physician-manufacturers, oriented towards supplying classical medicines to  Ayurvedic doctors. This stands in sharp contrast to mainstream Ayurveda that is  observed to have undergone biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization. This  paper argues that Kerala's classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market  constitutes an alternative modernity because it provided Kerala Ayurveda with a  different route to modernization impervious to the biomedical regime, as well as  endowing it with the institutional power to safeguard its regional identity.  Although physician-entrepreneurs are its key architects, it is sustained by  value regimes shaped by a unique regional medico-cultural milieu. Even when  industrially produced, classical medicines remain embedded within Ayurveda's  socio-technical network; unlike proprietary drugs sold as individual  product-identities through non-Ayurvedic channels, they travel together as a  pharmacopeia, distributed through exclusive doctor-mediated agencies. This  clinic-centric distribution format is best conceptualized as an open-source  business model as it made low-margin generics viable by packaging them with  therapies and services. Besides ensuring better access and affordability, it  provided resistance to pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property  concentration. By keeping the doctor in the loop, it prevented medicines from  degenerating into de-contextualized commodities; the service component of  Ayurveda therein preserved went on become the unique selling point in the  health-tourism market. The tourism-inspired proliferation of Brand Kerala  eventually triggered a paradigm shift in mainstream Ayurveda - shifting focus  from 'pharmaceuticals' to 'services' and from 'illness' to 'wellness'.  Furthermore, interacting with hybrid Ayurvedas in transnational markets, Kerala  Ayurveda co-produces new alterities countervailing the structurally dominant  biomedical paradigm.","According to 'Keeping the doctor in the loop: Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals in Kerala', there's a unique way medicine is made and sold in Kerala, a region in India. They have their own traditional medicine market, dominated by doctors who also make these medicines. Unlike big pharmaceutical companies, these doctor-made medicines are made using traditional methods and they're sold directly to other doctors, not through normal drug stores. This system has helped keep Ayurveda, a type of traditional medicine, alive and it's even become a big selling point for tourists. The focus is less on selling medicine and more on promoting overall wellness. This approach has started to influence how Ayurveda is practiced in other parts of the world too."
I've been hearing about this herbal medicine called BPGrit for high blood pressure. Is it safe to use and are there any side effects I should know about?,"A pre-clinical toxicological evaluation of herbal medicines is necessary to  identify any underlying health-associated side effects, if any. BPGrit is an  Ayurveda-based medicine prescribed for treating hypertensive conditions.  High-performance liquid chromatography-based analysis revealed the presence of  gallic acid, ellagic acid, coumarin, cinnamic acid, guggulsterone E, and  guggulsterone Z in BPGrit. For sub-acute toxicity analysis of BPGrit, male and  female Sprague-Dawley rats were given repeated oral gavage at 100, 300, and  1000 mg/kg body weight/day dosages for 28 days, followed by a 14-day recovery  phase. No incidences of mortality, morbidity, or abnormal clinical signs were  observed in BPGrit-treated rats throughout the study period. Also, the body  weight and food consumption habits of the experimental animals did not change  during the study duration. Hematological, biochemical, and histopathological  analysis did not indicate any abnormal changes occurring in the BPGrit-treated  rats up to the highest tested dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. Finally, the  study established the ""no-observed-adverse-effect level"" for BPGrit at  >1000 mg/kg body weight/day in Sprague-Dawley rats.","According to 'Twenty-eight days of repeated dose sub-acute toxicological evaluation of polyherbal Ayurvedic medicine BPGrit in Sprague-Dawley rats', BPGrit is a herbal medicine used for high blood pressure treatment. It was tested on rats for about a month to check if it had any harmful effects, but the rats seemed to stay healthy and didn't show any signs of sickness. The study found that there wasn't any bad side effect even at a high dose. So, it seems like this medicine might be a safe option for treating high blood pressure."
I've been hearing a lot about natural remedies lately. Are there any that could really help with high blood pressure?,"Dr Rustom Jal Vakil was India's pioneer in cardiology. He introduced the  discipline of cardiology in his country. His mixture of clinical acumen,  research and writing has survived him. Through his work with an ancient Indian  folk remedy, Rauwolfia serpentina, he ushered in the modern era of effective  pharmacotherapy of hypertension. His work was particularly significant since it  galvanized other workers into finding more effective agents for the treatment of  hypertension. He is remembered fondly by his acquaintances as an unassuming man  in whom a multitude of choicest qualities blended seamlessly with each other.","According to 'Rustom Jal Vakil and the saga of Rauwolfia serpentina', Doctor Rustom Jal Vakil was a big deal in India for heart health. He was the first to focus on cardiology, or heart science, in India. He did a lot of cool stuff, but one of his biggest achievements was his work with a traditional Indian plant called Rauwolfia serpentina. He used this plant to create a treatment for high blood pressure, which was a game changer. His work inspired others to find better ways to treat high blood pressure. People remember him as a really humble guy with a lot of great qualities."
"So, how does this National Exit Test thing affect me if I want to go to med school?","The Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister has accepted six amendments to the  National Medical Commission Bill suggested by the Department-related  Parliamentary Standing Committee (1). These amendments are: the proposed  National Licentiate Examination has been replaced by a countrywide final MBBS  examination called the National Exit Test (NEXT); the bridge course to train  practitioners from AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) in modern  medicine has been removed, and it has been left to individual states to take a  decision about this; the percentage of seats in private medical training  institutions under fee regulation has been increased from 40% to 50%; the number  of nominees from the states and Union territories who are members of the  Commission has been increased from three to six; the penalties for  non-compliance with educational norms for colleges has been modified; and the  punishment for practising modern medicine without qualification has been made  imprisonment up to one year and a fine of Rs 5 lakh.","According to 'The National Medical Commission - More of the same', some big changes are happening in the medical education system in our country. The final MBBS exam is now a national test called NEXT. Also, the idea of training traditional medicine practitioners in modern medicine has been dropped, and it's now up to each state to decide on it. Private medical colleges now have to regulate the fees for half of their seats, instead of just 40%. There are more representatives from states and territories in the Medical Commission now, up from three to six. The penalties for colleges not meeting educational standards have been changed. And if you're caught practicing modern medicine without the right qualifications, you could be looking at a year in jail and a hefty fine of"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately. How does it explain the cause of diseases and their prevention?,"This article of the series Dentistry and Ayurveda describes in brief, the basic  principles and unique concepts involved in Ayurveda namely the concepts of Ama,  Ojas, Rasas (tastes-types and the factors affecting the choice of the  drug/medicine etc.), immunity, etiopathogenesis and prevention of diseases in  Ayurveda in general.","According to 'Dentistry and Ayurveda--III (basics-ama, immunity, ojas, rasas, etiopathogenesis and prevention)', Ayurveda, an ancient form of Indian medicine, uses different principles to prevent diseases and maintain health. These include things like Ama, which is like the toxins your body builds up, Ojas, which is your body's natural defense system, and Rasas, which are different tastes that can affect what medicine you should take. So basically, Ayurveda guides you to balance your body's natural defenses and toxins with the right tastes or medicines."
I've heard that lifestyle can influence fertility. Are there any natural or alternative methods I could consider to improve my chances of having a baby in the future?,"OBJECTIVES: Secondary Infertility is a major concern worldwide, accounting for  about 40% of female infertility due to lifestyle factor. Secondary Infertility  is having a close proximity to a disorder Vandhyatwa explained in Ayurvedic  classics, due to a variety of causes. Several Ayurvedic interventions are  advised such as Panchakarma (∼purification therapy) for vitiated Doshas in  female reproductive organs, Snehapana (∼oral intake of medicated oil) followed  by Virechana (∼purgation) to produce quality ovum. Other internal medications  like Phalaghrita, Ashokarishta, Kanchanara guggulu etc. have a probable mode of  action with enhancing the perceptibility of endometrium for implantation.  Correlating fallopian tubes with the Artavavaha Srotas, its block is compared  with the Sanga Srotodushti (obstructive pathology occurring in channels)of this  Srotas. By virtue of the purification therapy and internal medication working  synergistically might remove the Srotodustht. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30 year old female with a history of eight years post  marital infertility was treated with Panchakarma along with Ayurvedic medicines  after being diagnosed as infertility due to tubal blockage for a period of  16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: After 16 weeks of treatment, she reported with amenorrhoea and  found Urine Pregnancy Test positive. Subsequently, confirmed the pregnancy by  USG, as single live intrauterine foetus of Sonic Gestational Age - 8 weeks  5 days.","According to 'Ayurvedic management of female infertility due to tubal blockage', there's a method in traditional Indian medicine called Ayurveda that can help with infertility caused by blocked fallopian tubes. This method involves a mix of body-cleansing therapies and herbal medications. A 30-year-old woman who couldn't get pregnant for eight years tried this Ayurvedic approach for 16 weeks. After the treatment, she got pregnant. So, it seems like these Ayurvedic treatments might be a good option for women struggling with this kind of fertility issue."
I've heard about this Shatavari stuff that's supposed to be good for women's health. How do I know I'm getting the real deal and not some knock-off?,"Shatavari-a famous Ayurveda materia medica used mainly as a tonic for women-is  distributed in health food products all over the world. The Ayurvedic  Pharmacopoeia of India identifies the botanical origin of shatavari as the  tuberous root of Asparagus racemosus. We recently investigated by DNA analysis  the botanical origin of shatavari products on the Japanese market. The results  suggested that their botanical origin was Asparagus; however, species  identification was difficult. In this study, we analyzed steroidal saponins,  including those specific to this plant, in these products and confirmed their  origin as A. racemosus. Next, alkaloid analyses of an authentic A. racemosus  plant and these products were performed, because several papers have reported  the isolation of a pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine alkaloid, asparagamine A, from this  plant. Our results suggest that neither plant material nor products contained  asparagamine A. It has been pointed out that Stemona plants are sometimes  mistaken for shatavari, because their tuberous roots have a similar shape to  that of A. racemosus, and pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine alkaloids are thought to be  Stemona-specific. These data strongly suggest that A. racemosus does not contain  asparagamine A, and that previous isolation of asparagamine A from materials  claimed as originating from A. racemosus was likely caused by misidentification  of Stemona plants as A. racemosus.","According to 'Chemical analysis reveals the botanical origin of shatavari products and confirms the absence of alkaloid asparagamine A in Asparagus racemosus', Shatavari - a popular supplement often used by women and found in health food stores - is really made from the root of a type of asparagus plant. Scientists checked out some Shatavari products sold in Japan and confirmed this. They also found out that these products and the actual plant they come from, don't contain a certain chemical called asparagamine A that was previously thought to be in them. Instead, it seems that there was a mix-up in the past, and a different plant with a similar-looking root called Stemona was mistaken for the"
I've heard about this plant called Murraya koenigii Spreng that's used in Ayurvedic medicine. What health benefits could I get from it?,"Murraya koenigii Spreng (Rutaceae), a medicinally important herb of Indian  origin, has been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Leaves,  fruits, roots and bark of this plant are a rich source of carbazole alkaloids.  These alkaloids have been reported for their various pharmacological activities  such as antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antidiarrhoeal, diuretic and  antioxidant activities. Apart from these activities, the plant is reported to  possess a wide spectrum of biological activities. Phytochemistry and  pharmacology of this plant make a demand of an exhaustive review of its  potential as a valuable therapeutic agent for the treatment and management of  various ailments frequently affecting humans. The present review gives a  detailed description of the phytochemical, pharmacological, clinical and  pre-clinical works carried out on this medicinal herb and also throws light on  its therapeutic potential.","According to 'An update on Murraya koenigii spreng: a multifunctional Ayurvedic herb', this plant, also known as curry leaves, is pretty amazing.

But that's not all - this plant has many other health benefits too. Researchers are saying that we need to look more into this plant because it could be a game-changer in treating and managing various health issues."
"I've been dealing with a lot of inflammation lately. Are there any natural remedies, like the Brahmi Rasayan I heard about, that I could try without irritating my stomach?","Brahmi Rasayan, an Ayurvedic preparation, was studied in rodents for its  antiinflammatory effects at po doses ranging between 1 and 10 g/kg. The drug  suppressed various experimentally induced inflammatory reactions and did not  show any gastric irritation in antiinflammatory doses. It is suggested that it  may partially mediate its antiinflammatory activity by interfering with the  action and/or synthesis of prostaglandins and also perhaps by stabilization of  the lysosomal membranes. Its antiinflammatory activity is comparable to that of  indomethacin.","According to 'Antiinflammatory effects of an Ayurvedic preparation, Brahmi Rasayan, in rodents', Brahmi Rasayan, a herbal mix used in Ayurveda, might help reduce inflammation. The researchers gave it to some mice and it seemed to chill out their inflammation without upsetting their stomachs. It seems to work similarly to some common anti-inflammatory medicines."

But remember, this is all based on scientific studies, so more research is needed to confirm how exactly it can be used in medicine. So, it's not a miracle cure, but it's definitely something scientists think is worth looking into."
"So, like, if I'm not into mainstream medicine, would it be okay to just stick with traditional or herbal remedies instead?","In-depth interviews and participant observation was conducted with 14 Hindu  religious renunciates, 70 years or older. Despite having taken vows renouncing  concern for physical pain or comfort, respondents differed markedly in their  attitudes toward pain and their rationale for utilizing medical treatment. They  differed still further in their use of Ayurvedic and allopathic medicine, with  the most culturally conservative accepting only Ayurvedic medicine. Rejection of  allopathic medicine tended to be associated with a highly systematized religious  world-view. The results are discussed in terms of both the ideological conflict  between religious world-view and medical usage, and the need for sophisticated  distinction of religious world-view if research on the religious factor of  health care utilization is to prove fruitful.","According to 'Identity, ideology and medicine: health attitudes and behavior among Hindu religious renunciates', a group of elderly Hindu monks were interviewed about their views on dealing with physical pain and using medical treatment. Even though they all had made a promise not to worry about physical discomfort, they had different attitudes towards pain and reasons for using healthcare. Some of them were more traditional and only used Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian healing system. Others were more open to modern medicine. The study found that the monks who were more hardcore about their religious beliefs were more likely to reject modern medicine. So, the takeaway is that religious beliefs can heavily influence how people approach healthcare."

"I've been struggling with psoriasis for a while now and the usual treatments aren't doing much for me. Are there any alternative approaches, like yoga or natural remedies, that can help me manage it better?","BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a genetically predisposed autoimmune disease mediated  by cytokines released by the activated immune cells. It manifests inflammatory,  scaly red or white silvery flaky skin which may be a fluid-filled lesion with  soreness and itchiness. The prevalence rate of psoriasis is increasing day by  day. Despite having such a high prevalence rate, the treatment of psoriasis is  still limited. Hence, there is a need to rethink the various treatment  strategies available in the allopathic as well as in the alternative systems of  medicine. METHODS: Various bibliographic databases of previously published peer-reviewed  research papers were explored and systematic data culminated in terms of various  treatment strategies used for the management of psoriasis. The prime focus is  given towards modern as well as alternative systems of medicine such as  phototherapy, a combination of phototherapy with pharmacotherapy such as  Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy to treat  psoriasis. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of 161 papers, including both research and  review articles, was carried out to make the article readily understandable. The  pathogenesis including inflammatory mediators and type of psoriasis is discussed  before the treatment strategies to understand the pathophysiology of the  disease. The uniqueness, procedure, advantages, and limitations of conventional,  advanced, and traditional systems of medicine to treat psoriasis are discussed  in detail. Emphasis has also been given towards marine sources such as fish oil,  marine sponges, and algae. CONCLUSION: Although there are many modern and alternative treatment strategies  available to treat psoriasis, none of them have been proven to provide complete  relief to patients. Moreover, they are associated with certain side effects. In  order to overcome them, novel drug delivery systems have been utilized and found  effective; however, their stability and safety become the major impediments  towards their successful positioning. Traditional and alternative treatment  strategies have found to be safe and effective but their use is localized to  certain areas. In a nutshell, to achieve successful treatment of psoriasis,  there is a need to focus on the development of stable and non-toxic novel drug  delivery systems or the promotion of traditional systems to treat psoriasis.","According to 'Treatment Strategies Against Psoriasis: Principle, Perspectives and Practices', psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin that can be itchy or sore.

What's the story behind the bird on the South African Medical and Dental Council's coat of arms?,"The legend of the caladrius, a bird with prognostic and healing powers, first  appeared in early Indian writings as the haridruva--a yellow bird that cured  jaundice. In classical Greek mythology it was a nondescript bird but in the  medieval bestiaries it became pure white. The caladrius is used in the coats of  arms of the South African Medical and Dental Council and also the Medical  University of Southern Africa. These appear to be the first use of this  medically significant bird in modern heraldry.","According to 'The Healing Bird,' there's this cool legend about a bird called the caladrius that was believed to have healing powers. The story started in ancient India, where it was a yellow bird that could cure a disease called jaundice. The Greeks also knew about this bird but didn't describe it much. By medieval times, it was thought of as a pure white bird. Today, the caladrius is used in the logos of a South African medical council and a university, which seems to be the first time it's been used like this in modern times."
Is this Punarnava plant safe to take if I'm pregnant or trying to get pregnant?,"The present study was undertaken to evaluate any possibility of teratogenic  effects in Boerhaavia diffusa (Punarnava), a widely used herbal medicine for  renal and urinary tract diseases by Ayurvedic physicians in India. The ethanolic  extract of Boerhaavia diffusa (BDE) was administered daily in a dose of 250  mg/kg, body weight p.o., to pregnant albino female rats during the entire period  of gestation. BDE was found to be devoid of any teratogenic effect as litter  size and survival rate of foetuses were the same as for the normal control group  and no foetal anomaly could be detected.","According to 'An experimental evaluation of possible teratogenic potential in Boerhaavia diffusa in Albino rats', there's no need to worry about the plant Boerhaavia diffusa, also known as Punarnava, causing birth defects. This plant, which is commonly used in India for kidney and urinary tract issues, was tested on pregnant rats and it didn't harm the babies or the mom rats at all.

I've heard about this AYUSH thing in India - what's going on with it and why isn't it working as well as they thought it would?,"The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) includes, inter alia, the establishment  of an AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy)  component (practitioner, trained assistants, drugs and equipment) in every  primary health centre (PHC). However, five years following the launch of the  NRHM, the AYUSH mainstreaming scenario is below expectations, riddled with  ethical and governance issues. Accounts from AYUSH practitioners at PHCs in  various regions of the state of Andhra Pradesh reveal enormous lacunae in  implementation: unfilled positions, inequitable emoluments, inadequate or absent  infrastructure, assistance and supplies, unethical interpersonal arrangements,  and limited support from non-AYUSH personnel. The widespread negative impact of  these conditions undermines the value of AYUSH, demotivating both practitioners  and patients, and failing to provide the intended support to the public health  system.","According to 'Less equal than others? Experiences of AYUSH medical officers in primary health centres in Andhra Pradesh', the National Rural Health Mission in India tried to include more traditional and natural healing methods, like Ayurveda and Yoga, in their primary health centers. However, five years after this plan was put into action, things aren't going so well. The practitioners of these methods are facing a lot of problems like unfilled positions, low pay, lack of facilities and supplies, and lack of support from other medical staff. This is hurting the reputation of these traditional healing methods and discouraging both the practitioners and patients. So, the plan to strengthen the public health system with these methods isn't really working out as expected."
I've been taking some Ayurvedic herb supplements to help with my cold symptoms. How can I be sure what's actually in these products?,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased global use  of traditional medicines, including Ayurvedic herbal preparations. Due to their  growing demand, their processed nature, and the complexity of the global supply  chain, there is an increased risk of adulteration in these products. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the use of DNA barcoding  for species identification in herbal supplements on the US market associated  with the Ayurvedic treatment of respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A total of 54 commercial products containing Ayurvedic herbs were  tested with four DNA barcoding regions (i.e., rbcL, matK, ITS2, and mini-ITS2)  using two composite samples per product. Nine categories of herbs were targeted:  amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and  vacha. RESULTS: At least one species was identified in 64.8% of products and the  expected species was detected in 38.9% of products. Undeclared plant species,  including other Ayurvedic herbs, rice, and pepper, were detected in 19 products,  and fungal species were identified in 12 products. The presence of undeclared  plant species may be a result of intentional substitution or contamination  during harvest or processing, while fungal DNA was likely associated with the  plant material or the growing environment. The greatest sequencing success  (42.6-46.3%) was obtained with the matK and rbcL primers. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that a combination of genetic  loci should be used for DNA barcoding of herbal supplements. Due to the  limitations of DNA barcoding in identification of these products, future  research should incorporate chemical characterization techniques.","According to 'DNA barcoding of herbal supplements on the US commercial market associated with the purported treatment of COVID-19', researchers have been checking out herbal supplements used in traditional Ayurvedic treatments for COVID-related symptoms. They tested 54 different products and found that only about 39% of them contained the plant species listed on the label. They also found some unexpected stuff in 19 of the products like rice, pepper, and even some other herbs that weren't listed on the label. Also, they found traces of fungus in 12 of them, which is probably from the plants or where they were grown. So, the takeaway is, if you're taking these herbal supplements, be aware that what's on the label might not be what's"
I've heard that Alzheimer's can start developing when you're young. Are there any natural remedies or lifestyle changes I can make now to help prevent it in the future?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder prevalent  worldwide among elderly populations. Owing to limited efficacy, side effects,  and poor patient compliance for current rationally designed therapies, options  are being searched from alternate therapies such as Indian (Ayurvedic), Chinese,  or other traditional systems. Areas covered: Following a comprehensive  literature search, the authors provide a review encompassing: (1)  pathophysiological changes involved in AD, (2) Ayurvedic holistic approach and  herbal medicines to manage dementia and AD, and (3) traditional plants and their  phytoconstituents effective in AD with description of possible mechanism of  action. Expert opinion: Traditional remedies could be adjunct therapeutic  options to allay wide-ranging pathological cascades of AD. Ayurveda offers a  holistic approach of treatment along with a list of nootropic herbs and  formulations that are the rich sources of antioxidants, anti-amyloidogenic,  neuroprotective, adaptogenic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory compounds  that are found to modulate neuroendocrine-immune activities, enhance memory,  intellect, rejuvenate brain functions, and improve quality of life. A strong  knowledge base of traditional systems coupled with contemporary science may  provide new functional leads for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders at  preventive, promotive, and curative levels, and evolution of new drug therapies  and development processes, though further research is needed.","According to 'Traditional Ayurvedic and herbal remedies for Alzheimer's disease: from bench to bedside', Alzheimer's is a disease that typically affects older people and causes problems with memory and brain function. Right now, the treatments we have often aren't super effective and can have some nasty side effects, so scientists are looking into other options like traditional Indian (Ayurvedic) and Chinese therapies. They've found that these traditional remedies might be able to help slow down the disease and improve memory and brain health. Ayurveda, in particular, uses a whole-body approach and includes herbs and plants that are rich in antioxidants and other compounds that can help protect the brain. However, more research is needed to fully understand how these treatments can be used effectively."
I've heard that having high cholesterol can lead to heart problems. Are there any natural herbs or remedies I could try to lower my cholesterol levels?,"Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of  death globally and hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors  associated with CVD. Due to a growing body of research on side effects and  long-term impacts of conventional CVD treatments, focus is shifting towards  exploring alternative treatment approaches such as Ayurveda. However, because of  a lack of strong scientific evidence, the safety and efficacy profiles of such  interventions have not been well established. The current study aims to conduct  a systematic review and meta-analyses to explore the strength of evidence on  efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic herbs for hypercholesterolemia. Methods:  Literature searches were conducted using databases including Medline, Cochrane  Database, AMED, Embase, AYUSH research portal, and many others. All randomized  controlled trials on individuals with hypercholesterolemia using Ayurvedic herbs  (alone or in combination) with an exposure period of ≥ 3 weeks were included,  with primary outcomes being total cholesterol levels, adverse events, and other  cardiovascular events. The search strategy was determined with the help of the  Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group. Two researchers assessed the  risk of each study individually and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or  consultation with a third researcher. Meta-analysis was conducted using the  inverse variance method and results are presented as forest plots and data  summary tables using Revman v5.3. Results: A systematic review of 32 studies  with 1386 participants found randomized controlled trials of three Ayurvedic  herbs, Allium sativum (garlic), Commiphora mukul (guggulu), and Nigella sativa  (black cumin) on hypercholesterolemia that met inclusion criteria. The average  duration of intervention was 12 weeks. Meta-analysis of the trials showed that  guggulu reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels by 16.78  mg/dL (95% C.I. 13.96 to 2.61; p-value = 0.02) and 18.78 mg/dL (95% C.I. 34.07  to 3.48; p = 0.02), respectively. Garlic reduced LDL-C by 10.37 mg/dL (95% C.I.  -17.58 to -3.16; p-value = 0.005). Black cumin lowered total cholesterol by 9.28  mg/dL (95% C.I. -17.36, to -1.19, p-value = 0.02). Reported adverse side effects  were minimal. Conclusion: There is moderate to high level of evidence from  randomized controlled trials that the Ayurvedic herbs guggulu, garlic, and black  cumin are moderately effective for reducing hypercholesterolemia. In addition,  minimal evidence was found for any side effects associated with these herbs,  positioning them as safe adjuvants to conventional treatments.","According to 'A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Ayurvedic Herbal Preparations for Hypercholesterolemia', heart disease is a major global health issue and having high cholesterol is a big risk factor for it. Some people are now looking at alternative treatments like Ayurveda, a type of traditional Indian medicine. This study reviewed a bunch of other studies to see if certain Ayurvedic herbs were safe and effective for treating high cholesterol. They found three herbs - garlic, guggulu, and black cumin - that actually did help lower cholesterol levels. Plus, they didn't find much evidence of any bad side effects. So, these herbs might be a good addition to other treatments for high cholesterol."
I've heard that traditional healing methods are gaining popularity again in India. Are there any that could help me with my stress levels?,"Medicine and healing have been critical elements of nation-building and  governance in India. There is a clear hierarchy: biomedicine, followed by  systems like Ayurveda which are to be 'mainstreamed,' and local health  traditions, which are to be 'revitalised'. Mindful that power nonetheless  resides in positions of marginality, this analysis drew from a health system  ethnography on revitalisation of local health traditions in three southern  Indian states. Data from multiple interviews with 51 healers, observations of  meetings, healing sessions and events convened by healers, as well as a  multi-stakeholder dialogue on local health traditions convened by authors were  analysed using a grounded analytical process. The state was a source of power,  but in an enmeshed, individualised form. Other sources of power included  accomplished others who viewed healers and their practices with respect,  healers' collectives that produced and reinforced power through the exercise of  certain rituals, and the sacred calling to heal, which assumed stringent  criteria for practice and training, while also creating a moral imperative for  service orientation. Our study shows how power rests in or is derived from  multiple sites and sources that inhere and interact in critical ways with the  state and other systems of medicine.","According to 'A light inside a pot': Sites and sources of power emerging from an ethnography of traditional healing in South India, the medicine and healing practices in India are kind of like a popularity contest. Biomedicine is the most popular, then traditional practices like Ayurveda, and local health traditions are trying to make a comeback. This study looked at how local health traditions are being brought back in three southern Indian states. It found that power comes from various sources like the government, respected individuals who value these traditional healers, groups of healers who gain power through certain rituals, and the deep sense of duty to heal others. So, the power in Indian healthcare comes from a lot of different places and people, not just the top dogs"
I've been hearing a lot about this herb called Ashwagandha. Does it actually help with brain health or is it just hype?,"BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of major neurodegenerative disorders remains a  healthcare mystery. The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress,  inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular  neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than  2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent  aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of  mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective  nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W.  somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery  systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science  direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha,  neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval  includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed  publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature,  Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera  mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease,  Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and  anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better  neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles,  and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of  neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of  W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are  further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their  neuroprotective nature.","According to 'Withania somnifera in Neurological Disorders: Ethnopharmacological Evidence, Mechanism of Action and its Progress in Delivery Systems', there's a plant called Withania somnifera, or Ashwagandha, that's been used for thousands of years to help keep the body and mind healthy. This study found that this plant can help protect against certain brain disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. It also suggests that using this plant in tiny, nano-sized forms might have even better effects. However, more research is needed to fully understand how it all works. So, incorporating Ashwagandha into your daily routine might be a good idea for your brain health."
I get migraines a lot and meds aren't really cutting it. Could stuff like yoga or Ayurveda actually help reduce the pain?,"OBJECTIVES: To Understand the efficacy of Ayurveda and Yoga in the management of  Migraine Headache. METHODS: 30 subjects recruited to Ayurveda and Yoga (AY) group underwent  traditional Panchakarma (Bio-purificatory process) using therapeutic Purgation  followed by Yoga therapy, while 30 subjects of Control (CT) group continued on  symptomatic treatment (NSAID's) for 90 days. Body constitution questionnaire was  administered to both groups. The outcome measures included Symptom check list,  Comprehensive Headache related Quality of Life Questionnaire and Visual Analogue  Scale. RESULTS: Forty-six (76.6%) out of 60 subjects belonging to both groups had Pitta  based body constitution. Following 90 days of intervention the AY group showed  significant reduction in Migraine symptoms including pain intensity (p < .001)  and improvement in Headache related Quality of Life (p < .001). The CT group  showed no significant change (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Traditional Ayurveda along with Yoga therapy reduces symptoms,  intensity of pain and improves Quality of life in Migraine patients.","According to 'Combination of Ayurveda and Yoga therapy reduces pain intensity and improves quality of life in patients with migraine headache', traditional Ayurvedic practices and yoga may help reduce the symptoms of migraines. In a study, people who did Ayurvedic treatments and yoga for 90 days reported less intense migraine pain and a better quality of life compared to those who just took typical pain meds. This might be worth considering if you're struggling with migraines."
I've been hearing about Brahmi as a natural antioxidant. How does it compare to something like Vitamin E?,"Bacopa monniera, Linn. (Brahmi: Scrophulariaceae) an Ayurvedic medicine is  clinically used for memory enhancing, epilepsy, insomnia and as mild sedative.  For the first time the effect of alcohol and hexane fraction of Brahmi has been  studied on FeSO4 and cumene hydroperoxide induced lipid peroxidation. Alcohol  fraction showed greater protection with both inducers. Results were compared  with known antioxidants tris, EDTA and a natural-antioxidant vitamin E. The  effect of Brahmi was also examined on hepatic glutathione content. The mechanism  of action could be through metal chelation at the initiation level and also as  chain breaker. The results suggested that Brahmi is a potent antioxidant. The  response of Brahmi was dose dependent. Tris, an hydroxyl trapper did not show  any protection in comparison to Brahmi where as EDTA and vitamin E did protect  against FeSO4. In experimental conditions 100 micrograms Brahmi extract  (alcoholic) was equivalent to 247 micrograms of EDTA (0.66 microM) and 58  micrograms of vitamin E. Interestingly Brahmi only slightly protected the  autooxidation and FeSO4 induced oxidation of reduced glutathione on lower doses  100 micrograms/ml and below, but on higher concentrations it enhanced the rate  of oxidation.","According to 'Bacopa monniera Linn. as an antioxidant: mechanism of action', Brahmi, a plant used in traditional Indian medicine, has some pretty cool effects. It's mainly used for improving memory, helping with epilepsy and insomnia, and even chilling you out a bit. But the new thing is that it's also a pretty impressive antioxidant - so it's good at fighting off the stuff in your body that can damage your cells. The study even compared it to other known antioxidants, like certain chemicals and vitamin E, and Brahmi held its own. In fact, in the tests, a certain amount of Brahmi was just as good as much more of these other substances. The catch is that this effect depends on how much"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda and the benefits of natural herbs. Are there any specific plants or herbs from the Himalayan region that are known to be good for health and wellness?,"The remarkable biodiversity of medicinal plants worldwide highlights their  significance in traditional and alternative medicine. Astavarga, a group of  eight medicinal herbs from the Himalayan region of India, including Roscoea  purpurea (commonly known as Kakoli), is esteemed in Ayurveda for its  health-promoting and rejuvenating properties. In this comprehensive study, we  aimed to develop and optimise robust UHPLC-MS/QToF (Ultra-high-performance  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with quadrupole time of flight)  and GC-MS/MS (Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) methods to identify  the phytochemicals in R. purpurea root hydromethanolic extract and essential  oil. We also conducted a comparative assessment of supercritical fluid  extraction and conventional solvent extraction methods for the first time in R.  purpurea root, highlighting their relevance to the medicinal field. Using the  UHPLC/MS-QToF method, we identified a total of fifty-six phytometabolites, while  sixteen volatile constituents were discerned within the essential oil of R.  purpurea by GC-MS/MS method. Among the volatile constituents, β-eudesmol  (40.84 %), guaiac acetate (10.55 %), and γ-eudesmol (10.31 %) were emerged as  the principal components. Our findings were further compared with the volatile  constituents extracted via supercritical fluid extraction and conventional  solvent extraction methods. Notably, our research unveiled the presence of a  carotenoid metabolite, 15-methyl retinol, for the first time. Furthermore, our  fatty acid analysis of the supercritical fluid extract revealed elevated levels  of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic and linoleic acids. The methods  were validated in terms of system specificity also. The discovery of these  well-recognised therapeutically active components in R. purpurea significantly  enhances its potential, highlighting its unique profile among medicinal plants  in the Himalayan region and its suitability for traditional Ayurveda.","According to 'In-depth phytochemical profiling of Roscoea purpurea (Kakoli): Comparative UHPLC-MS/QToF and GC-MS/MS analysis of supercritical CO(2) fluid - and conventional solvent-based extractive processes', researchers did a deep-dive study into a plant called Roscoea purpurea or Kakoli which is native to the Himalayas and is used in Ayurvedic medicine. They used high-tech methods to identify all the beneficial compounds in the plant's root, and they even found a new one! They also compared different ways of extracting these compounds, including a method using a supercritical fluid, which sounds pretty sci-fi, right? They found that this method gave them high"
Is there any truth to the idea that ancient remedies can help with Parkinson's disease?,"Parkinson's disease has existed in different parts of the world since ancient  times. The first clear description is found in the ancient Indian medical system  of Ayurveda under the name Kampavata. Traditional therapies in the form of  herbal preparations containing anticholinergics, levodopa, and monoamine oxidase  inhibitors were used in the treatment of PD in India, China, and the Amazon  basin. Scientific reevaluation of these therapies may be valuable, as shown in  the case of Mucuna pruriens and Banisteria caapi. Complementary therapies such  as massage therapy, biofeedback, and acupuncture may have beneficial effects for  patients and deserve further study.","According to 'Traditional and complementary therapies in Parkinson's disease', Parkinson's isn't a new disease, it's been around for a long time, even in ancient times. People all over the world have tried different ways to treat it, from herbal remedies in India, China, and the Amazon, to things like massage and acupuncture. Some of these old-school treatments, like certain plant-based ones, might actually be really helpful and they're studying them more to find out. So, it's not all about modern medicine, sometimes the old ways can help too."
"I've noticed that I've been feeling a lot of stress and anxiety lately, could this be linked to my chronic skin condition?","BACKGROUND: Good mental condition is a vital part of health. Physical  impairments would potentially have psychiatric manifestations during the course  of a disease that could cause patients to experience a wide range of  psychological conditions. This study was conducted to determine prevalence of  anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological morbidities among the patients  who received warded treatments at Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Teaching  Hospital, Sri Lanka. METHODS: A total of 148 patients admitted to the hospital were selected for the  study on a random systematic basis under four systemic groups (gastrointestinal,  integumentary, musculoskeletal, and nervous system) depending on the chief  complaint. The presence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms was assessed  by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 item version (DASS 21). The General  Linear Model (GLM) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Over 50% of the participants in all four patient groups belonged to age  group of 35 to 65 years, encompassing the fraction of population that actively  contribute to the workforce in the society. Stress, anxiety, and depression  values of patients belonging to different complications varied significantly, as  indicated by GLM (p < 0.05). Patients diagnosed with integumentary  system-related issues denoted the highest stress levels (27.7 ± 2.54), while the  mean stress values among the other systemic groups were not significantly  different among each other. The highest anxiety levels were indicated by  patients with nervous system-related issues (18.6 ± 1.51), while the lowest  anxiety levels were indicated by patients with integumentary disorders  (6.0 ± 2.73). The highest depression level was identified from patients  suffering from integumentary system-related disorders (31.7 ± 3.42), followed by  nervous system (23.2 ± 1.78), gastrointestinal (19.5 ± 3.77), and  musculoskeletal (16.8 ± 1.57) disorders. CONCLUSION: Overall, high distress levels were observed among the majority of  the patients. Furthermore, integumentary issues may lead to significant  psychological impacts. As most of the patients seek for Ayurveda treatments when  their diseased condition becomes chronic, it is vital to focus on a  biopsychosocial approach to patient assessment and patient care, in actual  practice.","According to the study 'Assessment of Anxiety, Depression, Stress, and Associated Psychological Morbidities among Patients Receiving Ayurvedic Treatment for Different Health Issues: First Study from Sri Lanka', having a physical illness can really mess with your head. They looked at people in a hospital in Sri Lanka and found that more than half of them, especially those between 35 to 65 years old, were dealing with some serious stress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, people with skin conditions and nerve problems had the highest levels of stress and anxiety. So, it's not just about treating the physical illness, but also taking care of the mental health side of things, especially for patients with long-term illnesses."
"So, I've heard that turmeric is good for health. Can you explain how it interacts with our body?","The thermodynamic property of the host-guest complexes formed between the  curcumin, component of Indian Ayurvedic medicine turmeric, a drug molecule, with  the supra molecule, p-t-butyl calix(8)arene was studied. p-t-Butyl calix(8)arene  has been used as a host molecule and curcumin as a guest molecule. Optical  absorption spectral studies were carried out to investigate the molecular  recognition properties of p-t-butyl calix(8)arene with curcumin. The  stochiometry of the host-guest complexes formed and the binding constant were  determined. An interesting 1:1 and 4:1 stochiometric host-guest complexes were  formed. Job's continuous method of variation and Benesi-Hildebrand expression  were used for the determination of binding constant and the stochiometry of the  host-guest complex formed.","According to 'Molecular recognition of curcumin (Indian Ayurvedic medicine) by the supramolecular probe, p-t-butyl calix(8)arene', scientists have been looking at how curcumin, which is found in turmeric, interacts with a larger molecule known as p-t-butyl calix(8)arene. They're studying how these two things mix together and found that they can form a complex in a couple of different ways. This could be important for understanding how these compounds could be used in medicine. Just like how different ingredients can change the taste of a recipe, the way molecules interact can change their properties and uses!"
I've been using some Ayurvedic powders for my health recently. How can I make sure what I'm buying is actually legit and not just some fake stuff?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that originated in  ancient India, and it is still in practice. Medicinal plants are the backbone of  Ayurveda, which heavily relies on the plant-derived therapeutics. While Ayurveda  is becoming more popular in several countries throughout the World, lack of  authenticated medicinal plant raw drugs is a growing concern. Our aim was to DNA  barcode the medicinal plants that are listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of  India (API) to create a reference DNA barcode library, and to use the same to  authenticate the raw drugs that are sold in markets. METHODS: We have DNA barcoded 347 medicinal plants using rbcL marker, and  curated rbcL DNA barcodes for 27 medicinal plants from public databases. These  sequences were used to create Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA  Barcode Library (API-RDBL). This library was used to authenticate 100 medicinal  plant raw drugs, which were in the form of powders (82) and seeds (18). RESULTS: Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA Barcode Library  (API-RDBL) was created with high quality and authentic rbcL barcodes for 374 out  of the 395 medicinal plants that are included in the API. The rbcL DNA barcode  differentiated 319 species (85 %) with the pairwise divergence ranging between  0.2 and 29.9 %. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing success rate of rbcL marker  was 100 % even for the poorly preserved medicinal plant raw drugs that were  collected from local markets. DNA barcoding revealed that only 79 % raw drugs  were authentic, and the remaining 21 % samples were adulterated. Further,  adulteration was found to be much higher with powders (ca. 25 %) when compared  to seeds (ca. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the utility of DNA barcoding in  authenticating medicinal plant raw drugs, and found that approximately one fifth  of the market samples were adulterated. Powdered raw drugs, which are very  difficult to be identified by taxonomists as well as common people, seem to be  the easy target for adulteration. Developing a quality control protocol for  medicinal plant raw drugs by incorporating DNA barcoding as a component is  essential to ensure safety to the consumers.","According to 'Creation of reference DNA barcode library and authentication of medicinal plant raw drugs used in Ayurvedic medicine', researchers have used DNA barcoding to check if the ingredients in Ayurvedic medicines are what they say they are. They created a library of authentic DNA barcodes from 374 different medicinal plants listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Then, they used this library to test 100 plant-based products sold in markets. The results? About 79% of the products were legit, but 21% were fake or mixed with something else. The powdered forms were the ones that were most likely to be dodgy, probably because it's hard to tell what's in a powder just by looking at it. So"
I've heard about this plant called Argyreia speciosa being used in Ayurveda. What exactly is it used for and how do they make sure it's good quality?,"BACKGROUND: The roots of Argyreia speciosa (Linn. F) Sweet (family:  Convolvulaceae) are used in Ayurveda to treat male reproductive and nervous  system disorders. OBJECTIVE: Isolation of scopoletin from the roots of Argyreia speciosa, and  development and validation of an analytical method using HPLC for the  quantification of scopoletin from the root powder of Argyreia speciosa. METHOD: Scopoletin was isolated from chloroform fraction prepared from  hydrolyzed methanolic extract and identified using spectral studies. A  reverse-phase HPLC-based analytical method was developed and optimized using the  Design of Experiment (DoE) approach to estimate scopoletin from the roots of  Argyreia speciosa. Scopoletin was separated and quantified using HPLC containing  the C18 column and a PDA detector. The optimized mobile phase was methanol:  water (pH∼3.2) [25: 75, %v/v]. RESULTS: The Box-Behnken design was used to optimize chromatographic parameters  and the extraction procedure. The validation studies showed a linear  relationship (r2=0.998) in the range of 1-40 µg/mL. The LOD and LOQ were found  to be 0.28 µg/mL and 0.84 µg/mL, respectively, and the recovery values were  found to be between 91.94 and 97.86%. The developed analytical method was found  to be robust as well. The amount of scopoletin was estimated to be  0.024 ± 0.0016%w/w from dried root powder. CONCLUSION: The recorded chromatogram and amount of scopoletin determined would  serve as one of the standardization parameters to access the quality of raw  material containing Argyreia speciosa. HIGHLIGHTS: Developed analytical method may be adopted as a part of the  standardization procedure for Argyreia speciosa in the quality control  laboratory.","According to 'Quantification of Scopoletin from the Roots of Argyreia Speciosa (Linn. F) Sweet Using HPLC Through the Concept of Design of Experiment', scientists have figured out a way to measure a specific compound called scopoletin from the roots of a plant known as Argyreia speciosa. This plant is used in traditional medicine and this compound is thought to be beneficial for male reproductive and nervous system health. The method they've developed is solid and can help ensure the quality of products containing this plant. So, if you're into natural remedies, this can be a good sign that what you're getting is legit."
"So, traditional medicine is pretty big in Bangladesh, right? Do you think it's a good idea to try some Ayurvedic remedies for my stress and anxiety?","The World Health Organization (WHO) Traditional Medicine Strategy (2014-2023)  aimed to help member states promote the safe and effective use of traditional  medicine. While economic conditions have markedly improved in Bangladesh, the  country is experiencing significant public health problems. Because of limited  medical resources, there is a strong incentive to enhance complementary and  alternative medicine usage in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to confirm  the perceptions and attitudes of medical doctors (MDs) in Dhaka, Bangladesh,  with regard to Ayurvedic medicine (AM). A total number of 159 MDs in Dhaka were  interviewed by face-to-face between February and June 2015. The study revealed  that 62.0% of MDs had treated patients with AM and 55.3% believed that AM should  be regarded as its own specialty, whereas 39.7% of MDs believed that AM should  be part of the conventional medical curriculum and 32.7% thought that AM did not  seem scientific. In terms of gender, 45.3% of male MDs agreed or strongly agreed  that AM only had a placebo effect. On the other hand, 65.8% of female MDs  disagreed or strongly disagreed it. In terms of age, 77.0% of MDs aged 36 or  elder (elder MDs) believed they were more likely to recommend AM use and 80.3%  of elder MDs believed that the government should encourage more initiatives to  promote AM. To enhance AM use, scientifically robust information on the  efficacy, safety and scientific basis of AM should be more effectively conveyed  to male MDs.","According to 'Perception and attitude of medical doctors in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with regard to Ayurvedic medicine', a study was done to see what doctors in Dhaka, Bangladesh think about using Ayurvedic medicine, which is a type of traditional medicine. They talked to almost 160 doctors and found that about 62% have used Ayurvedic medicine to treat patients. Over half thought it should be considered a specialty in its own right. However, only about 40% thought it should be taught as part of the standard medical school curriculum. Interestingly, they found that male doctors were more likely to think Ayurvedic medicine is just a placebo, but the majority of female doctors disagreed with this. Older doctors were more likely to recommend"
What exactly is a coma and how is it different from just being unconscious or sleeping?,"The description of coma and coma arousal therapy in Caraka Saṁhitā is described  in sṁtra 24, verses 42-53. It describes the definition of coma, differential  diagnosis of coma from other disorders of consciousness, signs of coma, etiology  of coma, coma arousal therapy, and emergence from coma. The similarities and  differences of these aspects of coma from the perspective of its interpretation  in modern medicine are discussed in this article.","According to 'Description of coma and coma arousal therapy in Caraka Saṁhitā and its corollary in modern medicine', the ancient Indian medical text, Caraka Saṁhitā, talks about what we now know as a coma. It explains what a coma looks like, how it's different from other unconscious states, how it happens, and even some ways to wake someone up from it. The paper compares this ancient understanding with how we view and treat comas in today's medicine."
I've heard about this plant called Rhus succedanea being used in natural remedies. How can I make sure I'm getting the real deal and not some fake substitute?,"Rhus succedanea is generally traded, distributed, and sold in the markets in its  crude and raw form. This may have been mixed with adulterants, mismanaged by  malpractices, and substituted with other closely related drugs having different  effect. This study is therefore carried out to authenticate the plant through  pharmacognostic evaluations including morphological microscopic and  physio-chemical features. Morphologically, the Rhus is a perennial small sized  deciduous tree, locally, called as Rakhkal in Pashto and Kakarsingi in Urdu. The  organoleptic evaluation showed that leaf had pleasant, aromatic odor, and  astringent taste. Anatomy of the midrib has shown a typical dicot histological  differentiation. The leaf was hypostomatic showing anomocytic stomata with  average stomatal number 27.1 ± 7.2 and stomatal index 14 ± 3.63. The average  vein islet, vein termination, and palisade ratios were 13.6 ± 3.04,  10.21 ± 1.92, and 6 ± 2.01, respectively. Leaf powder showed the existence of  various types of tissues. Fluorescence study and percentage extractive values  were also carried out. The phytochemical screening showed the presence of  carbohydrates, protein, alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and  anthraquinones, whereas tannins and fixed oil was not detected. Quantitatively  highest number of alkaloids 16% and flavonoids 19% in leaf was detected.

Himalaica J. D. Hook', researchers have been studying a tree called Rhus succedanea, or Rakhkal in Pashto and Kakarsingi in Urdu, to make sure it's the real deal when we buy it. Sometimes, it gets mixed up with other stuff or replaced with similar drugs that don't do the same thing. They looked at its physical features and stuff inside it, like its aroma, taste, leaf structure, and even the number of pores on the leaf surface. They also found proteins, carbs, and various other compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids"
I've been hearing a lot about this Ayurvedic medicine called Kutajarista. What is it used for and are there any side effects if I take too much?,"Kutajarista is a well known polyherbal preparation of which the main ingredient  is the stem bark of Holarrhena antidysenterica. This Ayurvedic medicine is  prescribed to treat amoebic dysentery and other disorders such as fever,  indigestion and malabsorption syndrome. Herbal medicines are very important  since, in common with conventional medicines, they contain biologically active  substances that may produce non-trivial side effects when taken in excessive  amounts. Very low doses, on the other hand, may have no therapeutic value. In  this paper we report the chemical standardisation of Kutajarista by HPLC  analysis based upon the presence of the biomarker conessine in the formulation.  The standardisation method is simple and reliable, and the precision of method  has been tested for repeatability (n = 3) and reproducibility (n = 9). The  response of a refractive index detector was linear in the concentration range of  0.1-1.0 mg/mL. Recovery studies were performed to check the method for accuracy.  The recovery was found to be in range of 99-105%. The developed HPLC method can  be used to quantify conessine for quality control of marketed Kutajarista  samples.","According to 'Chromatographic analysis of Kutajarista--an ayurvedic polyherbal formulation', Kutajarista is a herbal medicine used in Ayurveda, which is traditionally used to treat conditions like upset stomach and fever. Just like regular medicine, if you take too much it can have bad side effects, but if you don't take enough it might not help at all. Scientists have found a new way to check the amount of a specific ingredient, called conessine, in Kutajarista to make sure it's just right. This method is easy to use and has been proven to be reliable. So, this means we can keep the quality of this herbal medicine in check."
"I've heard about this plant called ""Kali Musli"" that's supposed to have a bunch of health benefits. What's the deal with that?","Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. (family Amaryllidaceae) is an endangered rasayana  herb which is popularly known as ""Kali Musli"". The plant is native to India, and  holds a special position as a potent adaptogen and aphrodisiac in Ayurvedic  system of medicine. It is an important ingredient of many Ayurvedic preparations  and is considered to have aphrodisiac, immunostimulant, hepatoprotective,  antioxidant, anticancer and antidiabetic activities. Various chemical  constituents like mucilage, phenolic glycosides, saponins and aliphatic  compounds from the plant have been reported. The plant is also considered as an  important component of various herbal preparations of the Chinese and Kampo  medicine. The present review is an attempt to enumerate various biologically  tested activities and evaluation of different phytochemicals present in this  important medicinal plant.","According to 'Curculigo orchioides: the black gold with numerous health benefits', there's this plant called ""Kali Musli"" that's native to India and is pretty awesome for your health. It's used a lot in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine. People believe it can boost your immune system, protect your liver, act as an antioxidant, and even help with things like cancer and diabetes. It's also known as a natural aphrodisiac, which basically means it could potentially spice up your love life. So, this plant is like a super plant with a bunch of health benefits!"
What kind of natural remedies do tribes in Andhra Pradesh use for common health problems?,"An ethnobotanical survey of Rayalaseema of Andhra Pradesh was carried out during  1985-1988. One hundred and thirty-one useful plants currently used by the tribal  and non-tribal inhabitants for treating different ailments are presented. Most  of the uses of the plants reported by herbalists appear not to have been  recorded hitherto. The study reveals some interesting information about the mode  of plant use in various ailments either singly or in combination. It has been  observed that though the tribes studied live under the same environment and use  the same plant species for treating diseases, their prescriptions are quite  different. This indicates that these tribes still retain their own traditions so  far as treatments are concerned.","According to 'A survey of plant crude drugs of Rayalaseema, Andhra Pradesh, India', researchers spent a few years checking out the plants in Rayalaseema, a region in India. They found out that locals, both tribes and regular folks, use about 131 different plants to treat all sorts of health problems. Even though they live in the same area and use the same plants, different tribes have their own unique ways of using these plants for treatments. It's pretty cool because these methods haven't really been documented before. This shows that these tribes have managed to keep their traditional practices alive."
"I've heard that Ayurveda might help with diabetes. Is there any truth to that, and what kind of treatments would it involve?","Diabetes mellitus is a condition that is extremely serious from both clinical  and public health standpoints. The traditional healthcare system of India,  Ayurveda, offers a balanced and holistic multi-modality approach to treating  this disorder. Many Ayurvedic modalities have been subjected to empirical  scientific evaluation, but most such research has been done in India, receiving  little attention in North America. This paper offers a review of the English  language literature related to Ayurveda and diabetes care, encompassing herbs,  diet, yoga, and meditation as modalities that are accessible and acceptable to  Western clinicians and patients. There is a considerable amount of data from  both animal and human trials suggesting efficacy of Ayurvedic interventions in  managing diabetes. However, the reported human trials generally fall short of  contemporary methodological standards. More research is needed in the area of  Ayurvedic treatment of diabetes, assessing both whole practice and individual  modalities.","According to 'Ayurveda for diabetes mellitus: a review of the biomedical literature', diabetes is a big deal and it's something that should be taken seriously. In India, they use a traditional healthcare system called Ayurveda, which includes things like special diets, herbs, yoga, and meditation to help manage it. There's been some research done that shows this approach could be effective, but most of it has been done in India and hasn't gotten much attention in the West. The human studies done so far don't quite meet our usual standards for research, so we need more studies to really figure out if Ayurveda could be a good way to treat diabetes."
I've been hearing a lot about this Ashwagandha thing lately. Is it actually good for muscle growth and repair?,"Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) is used in Indian traditional medicine,  Ayurveda, and is believed to have a variety of health-promoting effects. The  molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying these effects have not yet been  sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of Ashwagandha  extracts and their major withanolides (withaferin A and withanone) on muscle  cell differentiation using C2C12 myoblasts. We found that withaferin A and  withanone and Ashwagandha extracts possessing different ratios of these active  ingredients have different effects on the differentiation of C2C12. Withanone  and withanone-rich extracts caused stronger differentiation of myoblasts to  myotubes, deaggregation of heat- and metal-stress-induced aggregated proteins,  and activation of hypoxia and autophagy pathways. Of note, the Parkinson's  disease model of Drosophila that possess a neuromuscular disorder showed  improvement in their flight and climbing activity, suggesting the potential of  Ashwagandha withanolides for the management of muscle repair and activity.","According to 'Effect of Ashwagandha Withanolides on Muscle Cell Differentiation', Ashwagandha, a plant used in Ayurvedic medicine, seems to have some pretty cool benefits for our muscles. It looks like certain elements found in Ashwagandha, known as withaferin A and withanone, can actually help muscle cells grow and repair. This could be really useful for anyone hitting the gym and wanting to see better results, or for people recovering from muscle injuries. Plus, it might even help with certain neuromuscular disorders, like Parkinson's disease, as it seemed to improve the movement of fruit flies in a lab model of the disease."
I've been hearing a lot about this Ayurvedic remedy called Sitopaladi churna. Can it really help with things like bronchitis or allergies?,"""Sitopaladi churna,"" a well-known formulation of Ayurveda, is prescribed to  treat the disease like Bronchitis, Pneumonia, allergic conditions, viral  infection of the respiratory tract and as a natural antioxidant. A novel method  based on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled  to photodiode array detector was established and validated for sitopaladi  churna. Here, HPLC fingerprints data obtained for 28 samples including standard  sample were then treated to chemometric analysis like principal component  analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis for further analysis to evaluate  the differences in market samples of sitopaladi churna. Additionally, one major  marker compound, piperine was quantified and it also facilitated for relative  retention time. The simulative mean spectrum was also generated. The validation  results showed that the developed method was simple, precise and stable. Thus,  the developed chromatographic method adjoined with multivariate analysis can be  used as an efficient and practical approach for quality assessment of sitopaladi  churna.","According to 'Quality Assessment of Sitopaladi Churna Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Multivariate Analysis', scientists have developed a new way to test the quality of Sitopaladi churna - a popular Ayurvedic remedy used for respiratory issues like bronchitis and pneumonia. They used a technique called high-performance liquid chromatography to examine 28 samples of the remedy and identify its main ingredient. The results showed that their method is straightforward, accurate, and reliable, making it a useful tool for checking the quality of Sitopaladi churna in the market."
I've been having some stomach issues lately. Are there any natural remedies or foods that could help settle my gut?,"Jirakadyarishta, an Ayurvedic formulation prepared by the fermentation of a  decoction of Cuminum cyminum (seeds) is traditionally used for intestinal  disorders. RP-HPLC analysis of the decoction and the final processed formulation  revealed that apigenin-7-O-[galacturonide (1 --> 4)-O-glucoside] and  luteolin-4'-O-glucoside-7-O-galacturonide) were the two major constituents of  the decoction of C. cyminum. Selective hydrolysis of 7-O-glucosides of luteolin  and apigenin during fermentation resulted in an increase in the amount of  luteolin and apigenin. The 4'-O-glucoside-7-O-galacturonide of luteolin and  galacturonide derivative of apigenin were not hydrolyzed during fermentation.  Monomeric phenolics, together with 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), were also  introduced into the formulation through the jaggery and other plant materials  during fermentation. This communication highlights the importance of the ancient  processing methods used in Ayurveda.","According to 'RP-HPLC analysis of Jirakadyarishta and chemical changes during fermentation', Jirakadyarishta, a traditional Ayurvedic brew made by fermenting cumin seeds, is good for tummy troubles. The study found that the fermentation process changes the compounds in the cumin seeds, potentially making them more effective. The way this brew is made, including the addition of jaggery and other plants, also introduces other healthy stuff into the mix. So, this research is saying that the old-school ways of making Ayurvedic remedies are pretty clever and beneficial!"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine lately. Can it really help with things like heart disease or arthritis?,"INTRODUCTION: A number of traditional systems of medicine exist in India of  which Ayurveda is the most popular. Despite being in use for more than 3000  years, few properly designed trials have scientifically examined the clinical  potential of Ayurvedic and other medications. METHODS: We reviewed the MEDLINE database to identify clinical trials conducted  using traditional Indian medicines. Single case reports were excluded. RESULTS: Ayurvedic preparations have been successfully used for the treatment of  bronchial asthma, ischaemic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia. Formulations  containing curcumin were reported to reduce inflammation and disability in  double-blind clinical trials on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A number of  products are reported to be useful in patients with acute viral hepatitis. A  multicentric study by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed that a  preparation from Pterocarpus marsupium was effective in reducing levels of blood  glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin in patients with non-insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus. In another multicentric trial, patients with fistula-in-ano  were randomised to surgery or application of medicated seton (Ksharsootra).  Surgical treatment led to a faster cure but recurrence rates were lower with  medicated seton. Administration of extract from Bacopa monnieri, to children  with mental retardation, was reported to significantly improve short-term and  long-term memory. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based studies on the efficacy and safety of traditional  Indian medicines are limited. The essential ingredient in most formulations is  not precisely defined. High quality studies are necessary to evaluate and  compare the value of traditional Indian drugs to modern medicine.","According to 'Traditional Indian systems of medicine', Ayurveda, a popular traditional medicine system in India, has been used to successfully treat a few health conditions. For example, certain Ayurvedic remedies have helped people with asthma, heart disease, high cholesterol, and rheumatoid arthritis. Some Ayurvedic products have even proven useful in treating acute viral hepatitis. Research in India also found that an Ayurvedic preparation made from Pterocarpus marsupium, a kind of tree, helped lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. However, the paper does mention that we need more high-quality studies to truly understand and compare the effectiveness of traditional Indian medicines to modern ones."
I have a relative who can't get traditional cancer treatments. Could Ayurvedic methods help them feel stronger or healthier?,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize Ayurvedic perspectives on the etiopathogenesis and  supportive treatments for a biomedical diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: Hour-long, digitally recorded interviews were conducted with 10  experienced Ayurvedic clinicians, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using  techniques of qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified. The Ayurvedic description of the  pathophysiology of cancer uses traditional concepts translated into a modern  context. Although the biomedical treatment of cancer is considered valuable,  from an Ayurvedic perspective it results in degeneration and depletion. In cases  where biomedical treatment of cancer is not feasible, an Ayurvedic approach  focusing on strengthening digestion, eliminating toxins, reducing tumor growth,  and improving tissue metabolism is useful. An Ayurvedic approach to cancer  supportive care focuses on restoring equilibrium, building strength, and  rejuvenation. CONCLUSION: Ayurvedic medicine offers a unique perspective on the biomedical  diagnosis of cancer that emphasizes restoring wholeness, uses natural remedies,  includes a focus on emotional health, and emphasizes prevention strategies.","According to 'Correlating traditional Ayurvedic and modern medical perspectives on cancer: results of a qualitative study', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, offers a different way of looking at and dealing with cancer. Modern cancer treatments are helpful, but Ayurvedic practitioners believe they can also weaken the body overall. When modern treatments aren't an option, Ayurveda focuses on things like improving digestion, getting rid of toxins, slowing down tumor growth, and boosting the body's metabolism. It emphasizes using natural remedies and taking care of your emotional health, and aims to restore balance to the body, build strength, and encourage overall rejuvenation."
So I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic treatments lately. Can I trust the studies behind them if they aren't even using the full Ayurvedic diagnostic methods?,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this literature review is to evaluate whether  Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria or Western medicine diagnostic criteria have been  used in published clinical trials testing an Ayurvedic intervention/treatment. DESIGN: The PubMed, Embase, and Allied and Complementary Medicine databases were  searched to identify Ayurvedic clinical trials published from 1980 to 2009. A  total of 45 Ayurvedic clinical trials were identified and grouped into two time  periods: pre- and post-2000 periods. Each article was independently reviewed by  two calibrated reviewers. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that not 1 of these 45 studies, in either time  period, reported ""only-and-full"" use of the 23 available Ayurvedic diagnostic  criteria. In fact, 24.4% of these 45 articles never specified any diagnostic  criteria at all. While the percentage of articles using Ayurvedic diagnostic  criteria (either as ""only use"" or ""combined use with Western Medicine diagnostic  criteria"") doubled over the two time periods (27.7% to 59%), rarely were more  than 2 of the 23 Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria ever used. CONCLUSIONS: To improve confidence in their findings, future studies should  strive to correct this observed inappropriate and gross underuse of Ayurvedic  diagnostic criteria in the designing of clinical studies that aim to rigorously  test the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatments.","According to 'Use of Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria in Ayurvedic clinical trials: a literature review focused on research methods', researchers have not been using the full range of Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria when studying Ayurvedic treatments. It's like if you're trying to rate a movie, but only using a couple of criteria like acting and music, while leaving out important stuff like plot, cinematography, and character development. Also, in some cases, they weren't clear about what criteria they were using at all. So if we want to get accurate results about how effective Ayurvedic treatments really are, researchers need to step up their game and use all the tools at their disposal."
I've heard a bit about Ayurvedic medicine. Do you think it could help me manage my schizophrenia symptoms?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems  since 1000 BC. OBJECTIVES: To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for  schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register  (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified  studies and contacted the first author of each included study. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all clinical randomised trials comparing  Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic  drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently extracted data and calculated  random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where  appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat  basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were  unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as  global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic  herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early  (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly  equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic  assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to  12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating  1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga  group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared  with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study  early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people  allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared  to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea  and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09  to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a  complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill  people with schizophrenia, it is equally ( 10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13  to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment  of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine for schizophrenia', researchers have studied if Ayurvedic medicine - an ancient Indian approach to health - can help people with schizophrenia. They didn't have a lot of data to work with, but from the few studies they found, it's not clear whether Ayurvedic treatments are really effective. Some patients dropped out of the studies early, so we don't have their results. Those who stayed seemed to have mixed results. One group using a mix of Ayurvedic herbs known as brahmyadiyoga had some improvement in their mental state, but they also had side effects like nausea and vomiting. When Ayurvedic herbs were compared to standard antipsychotic drugs, the herbs didn't seem to work"
"So, there's no cure for this virus yet, right? Are there any natural remedies or herbs that could help boost my immune system or even fight the virus?","SARS-CoV 2 is a novel virus strain of Coronavirus, reported in China in late  December 2019. Its highly contagious nature in humans has prompted WHO to  designate the ongoing pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of International  Concern. At this moment, there is no specific treatment and the therapeutic  strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, with prevention aimed  at reducing community transmission. A permanent solution for the pandemic, which  has brought the world economy to the edge of collapse, is the need of the hour.  This situation has brought intense research in traditional systems of medicine.  Indian Traditional System, Ayurveda, has a clear concept of the cause and  treatment of pandemics. Through this review, information on the potential  antiviral traditional medicines along with their immunomodulatory pathways are  discussed. We have covered the seven most important Indian traditional plants  with antiviral properties: Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (family: Solanaceae),  Tinospora cordifolia (Thunb.) Miers (family: Menispermaceae), Phyllanthus  emblica L. (family: Euphorbiaceae), Asparagus racemosus L. (family: Liliaceae),  Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (family: Fabaceae), Ocimum sanctum L. (family: Lamiaceae)  and Azadirachta indica A. Juss (family: Meliaceae) in this review. An attempt is  also made to bring into limelight the importance of dietary polyphenol,  Quercetin, which is a potential drug candidate in the making against the  SARS-CoV2 virus.","According to 'The Plausible Role of Indian Traditional Medicine in Combating Corona Virus (SARS-CoV 2): A Mini-Review', there's no specific cure yet for COVID-19. Scientists around the world are looking into different ways to treat it, including using traditional Indian medicine. The paper talks about seven key Indian plants that might have properties to fight off the virus. It also mentions a compound found in many foods called Quercetin, which could potentially be turned into a drug to fight the virus. While we wait for a cure, the best thing we can do is try to stop the virus from spreading."
"So, in this traditional Indian medicine system called Ayurveda, people have different ""prakriti"" types that affect health and stuff. Does knowing my prakriti help figure out how my body reacts to medicines like aspirin?","BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine describes a  unique concept ""prakriti"", genetically determined, categorising the population  into several subgroups based on phenotypic characters like appearance,  temperament and habits. The concept is claimed to be useful in predicting an  individual's susceptibility to a particular disease, prognosis of that illness  and selection of therapy. The present study was carried out to study if the  platelet aggregatory response and its inhibition by aspirin varied in the  different prakriti subtypes. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee permission, normal  healthy individuals of either sex between the age group 18 to 30 years were  recruited in the study. Their prakriti evaluation was done using a standardized  validated questionnaire (TNMC Prakriti 2004). Their Platelet Rich Plasma was  incubated with either aspirin [2.5 micro-mole (μM) and 5 μM] or distilled water  as control for three minutes after which the aggregatory response to 5 μM  Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) was measured over a period of 7 minutes. RESULTS: We observed that in the study population of normal healthy participants  (n= 137), ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) was highest among the  Vata-pitta prakriti individuals [Median (range), 83.33% (52.33-96)] as compared  to the other prakriti types and these individuals responded better to lower dose  of aspirin compared to other prakriti types. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that identifying the prakriti may help in  individualising therapy or predicting proneness to a disease.","According to 'Prakriti (Ayurvedic concept of constitution) and variations in platelet aggregation', Ayurveda, a type of traditional Indian medicine, uses a unique concept called ""prakriti"" to group people based on things like looks, mood, and habits. The prakriti can help predict what diseases a person might get, how those diseases might progress, and what treatments might work best. In this study, they observed how people of different prakriti types responded to aspirin and found that people of the Vata-pitta prakriti type had the highest response. This suggests that knowing someone's prakriti might be helpful in deciding the best treatment for them."
I've been feeling pretty forgetful lately. Are there any natural herbs that might help improve my memory?,"Shankhpushpi is an Ayurvedic drug used for its action on the central nervous  system, especially for boosting memory and improving intellect. Quantum of  information gained from Ayurvedic and other Sanskrit literature revealed the  existence of four different plant species under the name of Shankhpushpi, which  is used in various Ayurvedic prescriptions described in ancient texts, singly or  in combination with other herbs. The sources comprise of entire herbs with  following botanicals viz., Convulvulus pluricaulis Choisy. (Convulvulaceae),  Evolvulus alsinoides Linn. (Convulvulaceae), Clitoria ternatea Linn.  (Papilionaceae) and Canscora decussata Schult. (Gentianaceae). A review on the  available scientific information in terms of pharmacognostical characteristics,  chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, preclinical and clinical  applications of controversial sources of Shankhpushpi is prepared with a view to  review scientific work undertaken on Shankhpushpi. It may provide parameters of  differentiation and permit appreciation of variability of drug action by use of  different botanical sources.","According to 'An update on Shankhpushpi, a cognition-boosting Ayurvedic medicine', Shankhpushpi is a plant often used in Ayurvedic medicine to boost memory and improve intellect. Researchers have found that there are four different kinds of plants that all go by the name of Shankhpushpi, and they're all used in various ancient remedies, sometimes on their own and sometimes mixed with other herbs. The effects of these plants might vary depending on which one you're using, so more research is needed to fully understand how they each work. But overall, it's a pretty interesting plant with a lot of potential benefits for your brain!"
"Are the herbal remedies I'm taking for my liver safe, or could they have harmful stuff left in them from the making process?","Background Herbal medicines have been used in the treatment of liver diseases  for a long time. In recent years, the use of herbal medicines for protection  from other strong antibiotics as well as drugs that can damage the liver during  their metabolism in liver and for treatment of liver diseases has increased all  over the world. It is important to mention that a number of organic solvents are  used at different stages of extraction/formulation development for these  traditional preparations in industries/pharmacies. In addition, some of these  solvents possess established carcinogenic properties and may enter the  formulation as residual solvents. Hence as per ICH guidelines it is mandatory to  keep the level of these solvents up to permissible limits. There has been a lot  of hue and cry that ayurvedic formulations available in the market are not  properly standardized for their quality due to lack of stringent regulations and  standards from regulatory authorities. Therefore the aim of present work was to  assess the compliance of ICH guidelines for level of organic volatile impurities  in common marketed ayurvedic hepatic formulations. Methods In this study, 25  ayurvedic herbal formulations available as OTC product have been assessed for  presence of residual solvents using gas chromatography with flame ionization  detector. Results This study on 25 fast moving hepatic formulations in the  market reflects that no residual solvents were detected in any of the  formulations however if present were within prescribed permissible limits of ICH  guidelines. The data was also subjected to statistical analysis (F-test and  t-test at 95% confidence level). Conclusions Results indicate the safety of  these hepatic formulations with respect to residual solvents. In addition  presents a simple, linear, specific, accurate, precise and rugged gas  chromatographic method for estimation of residual solvents.","According to 'Assessment of compliance level of ICH guidelines for organic volatile impurities in common ayurvedic hepatic formulations', herbal medicines have been used for a long time to treat liver issues. Recently, more people have started using them to protect their liver from damage that can be caused by some strong medicines. However, there has been some concern about the quality and safety of these herbal medicines available in the market. This is because a few of them are prepared using certain solvents that can potentially cause cancer. So, this study checked out 25 popular herbal liver medicines to see if they had any harmful solvents remaining in them. The good news is, all the tested medicines were safe and followed the safety guidelines. So, if you're"
I've been really stressed lately and I've noticed it's freaking out my skin. Could the two be connected somehow?,"Psychodermatology, a relatively neglected branch of dermatology in India, refers  to a holistic approach to skin diseases involving not only the mind and skin,  but also the cutaneous effects of psychologic stress. Among many Indian people,  culture, religion, the belief in karma, and the tendency to prefer indigenous  medical systems can all have a major impact on lifestyle, as well as the  approach to managing various diseases, including dermatologic conditions. The  origin of psychodermatology in India can be traced to Buddha's period.  Indigenous medical systems, such as Ayurveda, Yoga, and Unani, advocate control  of skin disease through meditation, exercises, and related practices. Scientific  practice of psychodermatology is still lacking in India, although there is an  increasing understanding of the mind-skin connection among both health care  providers and patients who have access to information over the Internet. The  first dedicated psychodermatology liaison clinic was established in 2010 in  Manipal, India. The common problems encountered have been anxiety, dysthymia,  and depression, especially in patients with psoriasis, vitiligo, and urticaria.","According to 'Psychodermatology: An Indian perspective', psychodermatology is all about understanding how your mind and stress levels can affect your skin. In India, they've been thinking about this mind-skin link since the time of Buddha and use traditional methods like meditation and yoga to help manage skin conditions. However, this way of treating skin diseases isn't practiced a lot in modern India but is becoming more recognized. The first special clinic for this was set up in 2010. They found that people with skin conditions like psoriasis, vitiligo, and hives often also deal with anxiety and depression."
"So, yoga is more than just stretching and breathing exercises, right? Can it help me feel less stressed and more connected with myself?","Yoga is a science of Holistic living and not merely a set of Asanas and  Pranayama. It is a psycho physical and spiritual science, which aims at the  harmonious development of the human body, mind and soul. Yoga is the conscious  art of self-discovery. It is a process by which animal man ascends through the  stages from normal man to super man and then the divine man. It is an expansion  of the narrow constricted egoistic personality to an all-pervasive eternal and  blissful state of reality. Yoga is an all round development of personality at  physical, mental intellectual, emotional and spiritual level.","According to 'Integrated approach to yoga', yoga is not just about doing cool poses and breathing exercises. It's a whole way of life that aims to help you grow physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It's about self-discovery and becoming the best version of yourself.

I've heard that some plants can help lower blood sugar. Is that true and what kind of plants should I be looking at?,"Diabetes mellitus is caused due to deficiency in production of insulin by the  pancreas, or by the ineffectiveness of the insulin produced. It is a global  problem and number of those affected is increasing day by day. The plants  provide a potential source of hypoglycemic drugs because many plants and plant  derived compounds have been used in the treatment of diabetes. Several medicinal  plants have found potential use as hypoglycemic in the Indian system of  medicines, including ayurveda. Many Indian plants have been investigated for  their beneficial use in different types of diabetes and reports occur in  numerous scientific journals. This article aims to provide a comprehensive  review on various plant species from Indian biosphere and their constituents,  which have been shown to display potent hypoglycemic activity. The use of herbs  as hypoglycemic is a major avenue in Indian perspectives particularly for  treating diabetes, which require to be explored more effectively as there are so  many literatures available on these aspects. This paper describes the chemistry,  activity and usage of the constituents isolated from these plants from India for  the treatment of diabetes.","According to 'Leads from Indian medicinal plants with hypoglycemic potentials', diabetes happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use it properly. It's a big problem worldwide, and more people are getting it every day. However, some plants can help lower blood sugar levels, and many of those plants are used in traditional Indian medicine, like ayurveda. There's a bunch of scientific research showing these plants can be really helpful for people with diabetes. The paper gives a detailed overview of these plants and how they can be used to manage diabetes. So, there's potential for natural treatments for diabetes, especially from these Indian plants, and we should definitely look into this more."
I've been hearing a lot about this Chyawanprash stuff. Does it really boost your immune system and make you healthier?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chyawanprash (CP), a traditional immune booster  recipe, has a long history of ethnic origin, development, household preparation  and usage. There are even mythological stories about the origin of this recipe  including its nomenclature. In the last six decades, CP, because of  entrepreneurial actions of some research Vaidyas (traditional doctors) has grown  to industrial production and marketing in packed forms to a large number of  consumers/patients like any food or health care product. Currently, CP has  acquired a large accepted user base in India and in a few countries out-side  India. AIM OF THE STUDY: Authoritative texts, recognized by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act  of India, describe CP as an immunity enhancer and strength giver meant for  improving lung functions in diseases with compromised immunity. This review  focuses on published clinical efficacy and safety studies of CP for correlation  with health benefits as documented in the authoritative texts, and also briefs  on its recipes and processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authoritative texts were searched for recipes, processes,  and other technical details of CP. Labels of marketing CP products (Indian) were  studied for the health claims. Electronic search for studies of CP on efficacy  and safety data were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE and DHARA (Digital Helpline for  Ayurveda Research Articles), and Ayurvedic books were also searched for clinical  studies. RESULTS: The documented clinical studies from electronic databases and Ayurvedic  books evidenced that individuals who consume CP regularly for a definite period  of time showed improvement in overall health status and immunity. However, most  of the clinical studies in this review are of smaller sample size and short  duration. Further, limitation to access and review significant data on  traditional products like CP in electronic databases was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials of high quality with larger sample  size and longer follow-up are needed to have significant evidence on the  clinical use of CP as immunity booster. Additional studies involving measurement  of current biomarkers of immunity pre- and post-consumption of the product as  well as benefits accruing with the use of CP as an adjuvant are suggested.","According to 'Chyawanprash: A review of therapeutic benefits as in authoritative texts and documented clinical literature', Chyawanprash is a traditional recipe that's been used for years in India as a health booster. It's kind of like the old-school version of a protein shake or a vitamin supplement. The study found that people who used Chyawanprash seemed to be healthier overall and had a stronger immune system. However, the research wasn't super extensive, so more studies with larger groups of people are needed to really confirm these benefits. If you're thinking about trying Chyawanprash, it could be a good idea, but remember, it's always smart to check with a healthcare professional first."
I've been hearing about this Ayurveda stuff a lot lately. Can it actually help improve my overall health and reduce stress?,"Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word, which means ""the scripture for longevity"". It  represents an ancient system of traditional medicine prevalent in India and in  several other south Asian countries. It is based on a holistic view of treatment  which is believed to cure human diseases through establishment of equilibrium in  the different elements of human life, the body, the mind, the intellect and the  soul [1]. Ayurveda dates back to the period of the Indus Valley civilization  (about 3000 B.C) and has been passed on through generations of oral tradition,  like the other four sacred texts (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and  Atharvanaveda) which were composed between 12(th) and 7(th) century B.C [2, 3].  References to the herbal medicines of Ayurveda are found in all of the other  four Vedas, suggesting that Ayurveda predates the other Vedas by at least  several centuries. It was already in full practice at the time of Buddha (6(th)  century B.C) and had produced two of the greatest physicians of ancient India,  Charaka and Shushrutha who composed the basic texts of their trade, the  Samhitas. By this time, ayurveda had already developed eight different  subspecialties of medical treatment, named Ashtanga, which included surgery,  internal medicine, ENT, pediatrics, toxicology, health and longevity, and  spiritual healing [4]. Ayurvedic medicine was mainly composed of herbal  preparations which were occasionally combined with different levels of other  compounds, as supplements [5]. In the Ayurvedic system, the herbs used for  medicinal purposes are classed as brain tonics or rejuvenators. Among the plants  most often used in Ayurveda are, in the descending order of importance: (a)  Ashwagandha, (b) Brahmi, (c) Jatamansi, (d) Jyotishmati, (e) Mandukparni, (f)  Shankhapushpi, and (g) Vacha. The general appearance of these seven plants is  shown in Fig.1. Their corresponding Latin names, as employed in current  scientific literature, the botanical families that each of them belongs to,  their normal habitats in different areas of the world, as well as the common  synonyms by which they are known, are shown in the Table 1. The scientific  investigations concerning the best known and most scientifically investigated of  these herbs, Ashwagandha will be discussed in detail in this review. Ashwagandha  (Withania somnifera, WS), also commonly known, in different parts of the world,  as Indian ginseng, Winter cherry, Ajagandha, Kanaje Hindi and Samm Al Ferakh, is  a plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is also known in different  linguistic areas in India by its local vernacular names [6]. It grows  prolifically in dry regions of South Asia, Central Asia and Africa, particularly  in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, South Africa, Egypt,  Morocco, Congo and Jordon [7]. In India, it is cultivated, on a commercial  scale, in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and  Rajasthan [6]. In Sanskrit, ashwagandha, the Indian name for WS, means ""odor of  the horse"", probably originating from the odor of its root which resembles that  of a sweaty horse. The name""somnifera"" in Latin means ""sleep-inducer"" which  probably refers to its extensive use as a remedy against stress from a variety  of daily chores. Some herbalists refer to ashwagandha as Indian ginseng, since  it is used in India, in a way similar to how ginseng is used in traditional  Chinese medicine to treat a large variety of human diseases [8]. Ashwagandha is  a shrub whose various parts (berries, leaves and roots) have been used by  Ayurvedic practitioners as folk remedies, or as aphrodisiacs and diuretics. The  fresh roots are sometimes boiled in milk, in order to leach out undesirable  constituents. The berries are sometimes used as a substitute to coagulate milk  in cheese making. In Ayurveda, the herbal preparation is referred to as a  ""rasayana"", an elixir that works, in a nonspecific, global fashion, to increase  human health and longevity. It is also considered an adaptogen, a nontoxic  medication that normalizes physiological functions, disturbed by chronic stress,  through correction of imbalances in the neuroendocrine and immune systems [9,  10]. The scientific research that has been carried out on Ashwagandha and other  ayurvedic herbal medicines may be classified into three major categories, taking  into consideration the endogenous or exogenous phenomena that are known to cause  physiological disequilibrium leading to the pathological state; (A)  pharmacological and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or  multi-herbal mixtures on specific non-neurological diseases; (B) pharmacological  and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or multi-herbal mixtures  on neurodegenerative disorders; and (C) biochemical, physiological and genetic  studies on the herbal plants themselves, in order to distinguish between those  originating from different habitats, or to improve the known medicinal quality  of the indigenous plant. Some of the major points on its use in the treatment of  neurodegenerative disorders are described below.","According to 'Scientific basis for the use of Indian ayurvedic medicinal plants in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders: ashwagandha', Ayurveda is an old-school healing system from India that believes in balancing different aspects of life (like body, mind, and soul) to cure diseases. It's been around since before 3000 BC and has been passed down through generations. It has eight different areas including things like surgery, internal medicine, and even spiritual healing. The medicines used in Ayurveda are mostly plant-based and some are called rejuvenators because they're believed to boost brain health. One of the most commonly used plants is Ashwagandha. It's also known as Indian ginseng and"
"I've heard about this new Ayurvedic thing called Nano Swarna Bhasma, apparently it's supposed to help with breast cancer treatment. Can you tell me more about it?","PURPOSE: The overarching objective of this investigation was to investigate the  intervention of green nanotechnology to transform the ancient holistic Ayurvedic  medicine scientifically credible through reproducible formulations and rigorous  pre-clinical/clinical evaluations. METHODS: We provide, herein, full details: (i) on the discovery and full  characterization of gold nanoparticles-based Nano Swarna Bhasma (henceforth  referred to as NSB drug); (ii) In vitro anti-tumor properties of NSB drug in  breast tumor cells; (iii) pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy studies of NSB drug  in breast tumor bearing SCID mice through oral delivery protocols and (iv) first  results of clinical translation, from mice to human breast cancer patients,  through pilot human clinical trials, conducted according to the Ayurveda, Yoga  and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (abbreviated as AYUSH) regulatory  guidelines of the Government of India in metastatic breast cancer patients. RESULTS: The preclinical in vitro and in vivo investigations, in breast tumor  bearing mice, established unequivocally that the NSB Nano-Ayurvedic  medicine-gold nanoparticles-based drug is highly effective in controlling the  growth of breast tumors in a dose dependent fashion in vivo. These encouraging  pre-clinical results prompted us to seek permission from the Indian Government's  holistic medicine approval authority, AYUSH, for conducting clinical trials in  human patients. Patients treated with the NSB drug capsules along with the  ""standard of care treatment"" (Arm B) exhibited 100% clinical benefits when  compared to patients in the treatment Arm A, thus indicating the tremendous  clinical benefits of NSB drug in adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: We have succeeded in clinically translating, from mice to humans, in  using proprietary combinations of gold nanoparticles and phytochemicals to  develop the Nano-Ayurvedic drug: Nano Swarna Bhasma (NSB), through innovative  green nanotechnology, for treating human metastatic breast cancer patients.","According to the research 'New Approaches in Breast Cancer Therapy Through Green Nanotechnology and Nano-Ayurvedic Medicine - Pre-Clinical and Pilot Human Clinical Investigations', scientists have been using green nanotechnology to make an ancient holistic Ayurvedic medicine more scientifically reliable. They created a drug made from tiny gold particles, called Nano Swarna Bhasma (NSB). They tested this drug on breast cancer cells and in mice with breast tumors, and found that it was really good at controlling the growth of the tumors. They even tested it on humans with advanced breast cancer, following all the government's rules for holistic medicine trials. The results were really promising, the patients who were given the NSB drug along with their regular treatment showed 100"
I've been hearing about this Ashwagandha stuff and its health benefits. How can I be sure the product I'm buying is legit and not just some fake powder?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng, is a  highly traded medicinal plant, which is used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani  systems of medicine to improve cognitive function, decrease inflammation, and to  counter the ill-effects of aging. Withanolide A and Withaferin A from  Ashwagandha were shown to improve immunity and have anti-cancer property,  respectively. AIM OF THE STUDY: Here, we aimed to create reference DNA barcodes for  W. somnifera and to authenticate root and powder samples of Ashwagandha  collected from markets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three plant specimen of W. somnifera were collected, and  reference DNA barcodes were generated using rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2 DNA  barcode markers. Market samples in the form of root (n = 33) and powder (n = 70)  were collected and authenticated using ITS2 and trnH-psbA DNA barcodes. RESULTS: Genomic DNA was successfully isolated from all plant specimens and  market samples. DNA barcoding showed that 77% of samples were authentic. About  22% of non-authentic samples were powder samples and only 1% were root samples.  Among the non-authentic samples, 18% were completely substituted with single  species (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., or Senna  auriculata (L.) Roxb.) and 82% were mixed samples containing more than one  species. About 63% of the mixed samples contained Ashwagandha as the major  ingredient. Furthermore, we identified that six taxonomically divergent plant  species from four families were present as adulterants in the mixed samples. CONCLUSION: DNA barcoding revealed that botanical adulteration in the market  samples of Ashwagandha is significant. Powder samples are more prone to  adulteration than root samples. The adulterated samples contained plant material  that is not related to Ashwagandha, which warrants strict quantity control and  market surveillance to derive the true medicinal benefits of this medicinal  plant.","According to 'Authentication of the market samples of Ashwagandha by DNA barcoding reveals that powders are significantly more adulterated than roots', scientists used DNA barcoding to check the authenticity of Ashwagandha, a popular medicinal plant often used in traditional Indian medical systems. They found that a lot of the Ashwagandha being sold, especially in powder form, wasn't the real deal. In fact, 22% of the powdered samples they tested turned out to be something else entirely, while only 1% of root samples were fake. This shows that it's really important to make sure you're getting the genuine product if you want to enjoy the health benefits of Ashwagandha. So, it"
"I've been hearing about these German health spas and alternative medicine practices, like the Ayurvedic spa and Heilpraktiker. Can they really help improve my health and well-being?","This paper examines the twin German institutions of the Kur (spa), and the 'lay'  licensed healing practitioner or Heilpraktiker. Through an ethnography of a  Heilpraktiker and his Ayurvedic spa in a small catholic village in Germany,  where patients arrive in person or as body parts by post, it examines the  poly-therapeutics of the practitioner, who seems to combine in his being a dizzy  array of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. It argues that the while the  Ayurvedic spa can be seen as a kind of variation of the traditional German Kur,  the Heilpraktiker's poly-therapy has to draw upon the special nature of the  practice of medicine in Germany, symbolised in part by the very figure of the  Heilpraktiker. It attempts to show that the practitioner's panoply of therapies  is partly a symptom of an epistemic impasse at the heart of biomedicine, leading  patients on an itinerant quest toward different therapeutic locales, such as the  Kur, or to different therapeutic possibilities, such as the ones offered by the  Heilpraktiker. But while the Kur and the Heilpraktiker would be either fringe or  alternative in the Anglo-American world, in Germany the Kur is part of orthodox  medicine, and the Heilpraktiker is a legal entity; and the two together re-draw  and make fuzzy what elsewhere seem to be clearly drawn boundaries between  medicine and the spa, between pleasure and therapy, and medicine and alternative  medicine.","According to 'Of relics, body parts and laser beams: the German Heilpraktiker and his Ayurvedic spa', German spas, or Kurs, and a type of healer called a Heilpraktiker offer a mix of traditional and alternative treatments. This paper looks at one of these healers who runs an Ayurvedic spa, where people come in person or send body parts by mail for healing. The Heilpraktiker uses a range of therapies based on both regular and alternative medicine to help his patients. In Germany, unlike places like the US or UK, these spas and healers are considered part of mainstream healthcare. This blurs the line between medicine and spa treatment, traditional and alternative therapy."
"So, cannabis has been used as a medicine for thousands of years, huh? What kind of health benefits does it offer?","The history of Cannabis goes along that of humankind, as speculated based on  geographical and evolutionary models together with historic data collected to  date. Its medical use is several thousand years old, as attested both by  archeobotanical evidence of Cannabis remains and written records found in  ancient texts from the sacred Vedic foundational texts of Ayurvedic medicine  (about 800 before current era [BCE]) to the first known Pharmacopoea, the  Chinese ""Shen Nung Pen Ts'ao Ching"" (1 century BCE). In this paper, we retrace  the history of Cannabis traveling through the key stages of its diffusion among  the most important ancient cultures up to our days, when we are facing a  renaissance of its medical employment. We report through the centuries evidence  of its use in numerous pathologic conditions especially for its  anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and anticonvulsing properties that support the  requirement to direct our present research efforts into the definitive  understanding of its efficacy.","According to 'Medical Cannabis: A plurimillennial history of an evergreen', people have been using cannabis for medical purposes for thousands of years. It was mentioned in ancient medical texts and was used in various cultures. It was known for its anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and seizure-reducing properties. Nowadays, we're seeing a comeback of its medical usage and there's a lot of research going on to figure out exactly how effective it is."
"So, according to this Ayurveda thing, my digestion and metabolism can be regular, irregular, intense, or weak. How can I figure out which one I am?","According to Ayurveda, the traditional system of healthcare of Indian origin,  Agni is the factor responsible for digestion and metabolism. Four functional  states (Agnibala) of Agni have been recognized: regular, irregular, intense, and  weak. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a  self-assessment tool to estimate Agnibala The developed tool was evaluated for  its reliability and validity by administering it to 300 healthy volunteers of  either gender belonging to 18 to 40-year age group. Besides confirming the  statistical validity and reliability, the practical utility of the newly  developed tool was also evaluated by recording serum lipid parameters of all the  volunteers. The results show that the lipid parameters vary significantly  according to the status of Agni The tool, therefore, may be used to screen  normal population to look for possible susceptibility to certain health  conditions.","According to 'Development, Validation, and Verification of a Self-Assessment Tool to Estimate Agnibala (Digestive Strength)', Ayurveda (a traditional Indian healthcare system) says that our digestion and metabolism strength, which they call Agni, can be in one of four states - regular, irregular, intense, or weak. The researchers in this study made a tool to help people figure out which state their Agni is in. They tested this tool on 300 people and found that it works pretty well. They also noticed that people's blood cholesterol levels changed depending on their Agni state. So, this tool could help spot if you're more likely to have certain health issues."
I've been hearing a lot about this ayurveda stuff. Is it safe and does it really work for things modern medicine doesn't cover?,"Globally there is an increasing interest in alternative routes to health such as  ayurveda. There is a need to conduct globally acceptable clinical research in  ayurvedic therapeutics (AT). Some of the issues in investigating AT in  randomised clinical trials (CT) are: selection of appropriate AT, non-drug  and/or drug AT, identification of objective outcomes, devising adequate  placebo/positive controls, difficulties of blinding, guarding against bias,  duration of trials, number of patients, dose optimisation, etc. There is also a  need to establish reasonable safety of this therapy in CT. If AT has to complete  with new chemical entities and biotechnology products, clinical research and  development of AT should be focussed on unmet medical needs utilising principles  and practices of modern CT approaches.","According to 'Clinical research on ayurvedic therapeutics: myths, realities and challenges', there's a growing interest around the world in alternative health methods like ayurveda. The issue is, we need to do more research to figure out how effective ayurveda treatments are. This includes figuring out the best treatments to test, how to measure success, and making sure the studies are fair and unbiased. We also need to make sure these treatments are safe. This research is important to help ayurveda keep up with new medical treatments and technologies."
"I've been having some women's health issues, but I'm not comfortable going to a doctor. Are there any natural remedies I could try out?","The science of life--Ayurveda is practiced in India since time immemorial.  Besides being cheap and easily available Ayurvedic drugs are considered safe.  Moreover, there is surge in the interest in Ayurveda due to quest of alternative  medicines. Many of the gynecological disorders being not reported to the  physicians, are treated with household remedies in India. The science of  Ayurveda deals with these issues in a systematic manner as evident from the  classification of diseases available and the number of plant drugs or the  combinations thereof available for the treatment. In the present article,  Ayurvedic herbal formulations and single plant drugs used traditionally in  treatment of gynecological disorders are described.","According to 'Ayurveda and gynecological disorders', Ayurveda, a kind of traditional medicine from India, is getting popular for treating women's health issues. It's pretty cheap, considered safe, and you can often find the ingredients right at home. It's like your grandma's home remedies, but with a system to it. Ayurveda uses different plant-based medicines or a mix of them to deal with specific health problems. So, it could be a good option if you're looking for alternatives to typical Western medicine."
I've got rheumatoid arthritis and the regular treatments aren't really doing it for me. Are there any natural or herbal remedies that I could try out?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the past years, the treatment of rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) has undergone remarkable changes in all therapeutic modes. The  present newfangled care in clinical research is to determine and to pick a new  track for better treatment options for RA. Recent ethnopharmacological  investigations revealed that traditional herbal remedies are the most preferred  modality of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, several  ayurvedic modes of treatments and formulations for RA are not much studied and  documented from Indian traditional system of medicine. Therefore, this directed  us to develop an integrated database, RAACFDb (acronym: Rheumatoid Arthritis  Ayurvedic Classical Formulations Database) by consolidating data from the  repository of Vedic Samhita - The Ayurveda to retrieve the available  formulations information easily. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature data was gathered using several search engines  and from ayurvedic practitioners for loading information in the database. In  order to represent the collected information about classical ayurvedic  formulations, an integrated database is constructed and implemented on a MySQL  and PHP back-end. RESULTS: The database is supported by describing all the ayurvedic classical  formulations for the treatment rheumatoid arthritis. It includes composition,  usage, plant parts used, active ingredients present in the composition and their  structures. CONCLUSION: The prime objective is to locate ayurvedic formulations proven to be  quite successful and highly effective among the patients with reduced side  effects. The database (freely available at  www.beta.vit.ac.in/raacfdb/index.html) hopefully enables easy access for  clinical researchers and students to discover novel leads with reduced side  effects.","According to 'RAACFDb: Rheumatoid arthritis ayurvedic classical formulations database', researchers have been looking for new ways to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and they've been turning to traditional herbal remedies for answers.

I've been feeling super stressed and my friend mentioned something about adaptogens helping out. Can certain plants like this Asparagus racemosus thing really help me cope with stress and other pressures?,"Asparagus racemosus Willd. (Asparagaceae) is an important medicinal plant of  tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the  Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as  Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Asparagus racemosus is mainly known for its  phytoestrogenic properties. With an increasing realization that hormone  replacement therapy with synthetic oestrogens is neither as safe nor as  effective as previously envisaged, the interest in plant-derived oestrogens has  increased tremendously making Asparagus racemosus particularly important. The  plant has been shown to aid in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and  in alcohol abstinence-induced withdrawal symptoms. In Ayurveda, Asparagus  racemosus has been described as a rasayana herb and has been used extensively as  an adaptogen to increase the non-specific resistance of organisms against a  variety of stresses. Besides use in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery,  the plant also has potent antioxidant, immunostimulant, anti-dyspepsia and  antitussive effects. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus  racemosus is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and  inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction in the  form of deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered  'endangered' in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of  this plant is crucial. This article aims to evaluate the biological activities,  pharmacological applications and clinical studies of Asparagus racemosus in an  attempt to provide a direction for further research. Keeping in mind the fact  that it is the active principle that imparts medicinal value to a plant;  consistency in quality and quantity needs to be maintained to ensure uniform  drug efficacy. Also, deliberate or inadvertent adulteration needs to be dealt  with at an early stage. To overcome these prevalent problems, the availability  of genetically superior and uniform planting material is essential. This can be  obtained by a combination of various biotechnological tools involving  chemoprofiling, tissue culture and use of molecular markers. Along with the  application of these methods, proper agro-techniques and adequate marketing  opportunities would encourage cultivation of Asparagus racemosus and thereby  contribute to its conservation. There are also several gaps in the existing  literature with regard to the pharmacological actions of Asparagus racemosus.  These include an incomplete understanding about the interaction/synergy between  Asparagus racemosus and other plant constituents in polyherbal formulations;  lack of information regarding the mode of action of the various constituents of  Asparagus racemosus, etc. Consequently, we have suggested a 'systems biology'  approach that includes metabolite profiling, metabolic fingerprinting,  metabolite target analysis and metabonomics to enable further research.","According to 'Asparagus racemosus--ethnopharmacological evaluation and conservation needs', there's a plant in India called Asparagus racemosus that's pretty amazing. It's been used in traditional medicine for ages and can help with a ton of health issues. It's got properties similar to estrogen, the female hormone, and can help with neurological disorders and withdrawal symptoms from alcohol. It's also been used to boost the immune system, help with digestion and even as a cough suppressant. But there's a problem - the plant is becoming endangered due to deforestation and over-harvesting. So, scientists are trying to figure out ways to conserve it and make sure it's available for future generations. They're also keen on"
I've been hearing about this Ayurvedic concept of body types called Prakriti. Can you explain how it relates to my body weight and overall health?,"BACKGROUND: Body composition and types are often considered essential health  indicators for lifestyle-related disease. Assessment of body type based on  tridosha is regarded as a prerequisite in Ayurveda. AIM: To correlate body compositions and somatotypes with Prakriti body types. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 463 adult individuals was done.  Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured. Heath-Carter  somatotypes and Prakriti body types were also determined. Tests of association  were calculated. Correlation and concordance analysis was also done to infer the  correlation between body composition parameters and Prakriti body types. RESULTS: Kapha Prakriti have significantly higher body weight, body mass index  (BMI), body fat percentage and body fat mass. Vata have the lowest mean values  in all body composition parameters with Pitta in the intermediate position  compared to the other Prakriti types. There is a strong and positive statistical  association between Prakriti body types and body composition parameters, except  height. Cohen's Kappa analysis reveals there is a fair concordance between  Prakriti body types and somatotype. CONCLUSIONS: Prakriti assessment can explain an individual's fatness as it  correlates with body composition parameters and could be used to predict risk  susceptibility to various complex disorders.","According to 'Correlation of body composition parameters and anthropometric somatotypes with Prakriti body types among the Meitei adults of Manipur, India', your body type, as classified in Ayurveda, can say a lot about your health. For example, people with a body type known as Kapha were found to have higher body weight, BMI, and body fat. On the other hand, those with a body type called Vata had the lowest values in these areas, with Pitta type falling somewhere in the middle. So, knowing your body type could give you a heads up about potential health risks and help guide your lifestyle choices."
I've heard about genistein in soy products being good for health. Can it really help prevent diseases like cancer and osteoporosis?,"Genistein is the natural isoflavone and a phytoestrogen with a broad range of  pharmacological properties, such as tyrosine and topoisomerase inhibition. It  also induces apoptosis and cell proliferation inhibition, differentiates cancer  cells. Added health benefits include the reduction of osteoporosis by  suppressing osteoclasts and lymphocyte functions, decreased the risk of  cardiovascular attacks and relieved postmenopausal problems. Genistein  traditionally used in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine and are found to be  associated with lower risk of breast, prostate and lung cancer. Numerous factors  comprising genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations are evidenced to  be responsible for breast, prostate and lung cancer. In present review, an  overview on genistein, the various analytical methods and drug delivery  approaches to determine genistein in the formulations are discussed. It may help  to develop novel formulations with better solubility and bioavailability of  genistein. The tumor cell scan may be targeted to form a stable genistein  formulation.","According to 'An Overview on Genistein and its Various Formulations', genistein is a natural substance found in some plants that has a bunch of health benefits. It can help slow down or stop cancer cells from growing, and it's also good for bone health and heart health. It can even help with some of the problems women experience after menopause. Genistein is often used in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, and people who consume it regularly may have a lower risk of breast, prostate, and lung cancer. Scientists are looking at different ways to deliver genistein to the body, hoping to make it more effective."
I've heard about these traditional Indian medicines made from metals. What's the process behind making something like 'vanga bhasma'?,"The preparation method of metal based Indian traditional drugs involves  conversion of a pure metal into its oxide by repeated high temperature  calcination cycles. In this work, the effect of number of calcination cycles  followed in the preparation of tin oxide based Ayurvedic drug, 'vanga bhasma'  was studied by a systematic characterization of the drug samples after various  calcination stages. It was found that tin was in the form of Sn4+ state and that  the formation of SnO2 proceeded step-wise through Sn(OH)4.","According to 'Effect of calcination cycles on the preparation of tin oxide based traditional drug: studies on its formation and characterization', the process of creating a specific traditional Indian medicine involves a lot of heating and cooling stages. This is done to transform a metal into a different form, which in this case, is tin oxide. The study found that the transformation doesn't happen all at once, but in stages. It's kind of like baking a cake - you've got to follow the steps in order and give it time to bake properly."
"I've been feeling super out of it since my stroke, and traditional therapy isn't really doing it for me. Could something like yoga or other natural remedies make a difference?","PURPOSE: We present a case study of a woman who used yogic breathing as  Ayurvedic medicine in her recovery from poststroke aphasia. Ayurvedic medicine  is one of the most ancient medicines of the world, but it is not widely used for  aphasia rehabilitation in many Western countries. The description of this case  aims to further the understanding of the benefits that this type of medicine may  provide to poststroke patients living with aphasia. METHOD: After her stroke, the patient received brief conventional language  therapy for her aphasia. At 5 weeks post stroke, she received no further  conventional rehabilitation; instead, she consulted with a Vedic priest. She  followed a regimen of different body manipulations, yogic breathing techniques,  and ingestion of coconut oil. Cognitive and language testing was performed  throughout a 3-month period while she was involved in this therapy. RESULTS: Overall, improvement was noted in language, visual attention, and some  mood measures. CONCLUSION: Although case studies lead to limited conclusions, changes were  observed for this individual using Ayurvedic medicine. Given the changes in  language and some aspects of cognition seen in this patient, further exploration  of the effectiveness of yogic breathing and Ayurvedic medicine in the treatment  of poststroke aphasia is warranted.","According to 'Yogic breathing and Ayurveda in aphasia: a case study', a woman who had trouble with language and attention after a stroke saw improvements when she started using Ayurvedic medicine techniques. Instead of continuing with regular language therapy, she started doing different body movements and breathing exercises from yoga, and also added coconut oil to her diet. While this is just one person's experience, it suggests that this sort of approach could help others with similar problems after a stroke. So, if you know someone recovering from a stroke, maybe they could try adding some yoga or other Ayurvedic practices to their recovery routine."
"I've been hearing about these mind-body programs, like yoga and meditation. Do they actually help with self-awareness and overall well-being?","OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of a comprehensive mind-body program  on sense of nondual awareness and spiritual awakening. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: The study compared the effects of participation in an  intensive 6-day Ayurveda-based mind-body program that addressed physical,  emotional, and spiritual domains as compared with a control condition. SETTING: Resort setting. SUBJECTS: Participants were 69 healthy women and men (mean age 53.9 years; range  32-86). OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the Nondual Embodiment Thematic  Inventory (NETI). RESULTS: A significant group by time interaction (p = 0.029) indicated that  after the intervention, participants in the mind-body program showed a  significant increase in NETI scores (p < 0.03), which was sustained 1 month  later (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that an intensive program providing holistic  instruction and experience in mind-body practices can lead to a significant and  sustained shift in perception of self-awareness, one that is likely favorable to  well-being.","According to 'Change in Sense of Nondual Awareness and Spiritual Awakening in Response to a Multidimensional Well-Being Program', joining a 6-day mind-body wellness program that focuses on your physical, emotional, and spiritual health can actually improve your self-awareness. This isn't just a quick fix either - participants still felt the benefits a month after the program ended. This could be a cool way to feel more connected to yourself and potentially boost your overall well-being."
"I've heard about this tree bark from India that's supposed to be good for heart health. Is it really legit, and safe to use?","The bark of the tree Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) is widely used in Indian medicine  (Ayurveda) for various cardiovascular ailments. The bark has been reported to  contain several bioactive compounds. Many experimental studies have reported its  antioxidant, anti-ischemic, antihypertensive, and antihypertrophic effects,  which have relevance to its therapeutic potential in cardiovascular diseases in  humans. Several clinical studies have reported its efficacy mostly in patients  with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and heart failure. However, a major  shortcoming in all these experimental and clinical studies is the absence of  phytochemical standardization of the extracts. In addition, many clinical  studies are poor in terms of design and methods used for generating safety data.  This review discusses how to address all these issues for a scientific  validation of this medicinal plant.","According to 'Therapeutic potential of Terminalia arjuna in cardiovascular disorders', the bark from the Terminalia arjuna tree, commonly used in Indian medicine, could be beneficial for various heart-related conditions. The bark contains special compounds that could help in reducing heart disease, high blood pressure, and even heart failure. However, more research needs to be done to understand how to use this bark effectively and safely. Right now, there's no standard way to measure the important elements in the bark extracts and the studies done so far don't have great design or safety data. So, while the bark could be super helpful for heart health, scientists need to do more work to confirm this."
Is there a natural herb that can help with inflammation and other health issues?,"Pluchea lanceolata (DC.) Oliv. & Hiern, (Family: Asteraceae) is a rapidly  spreading perennial herb, considered valuable for the management of  anti-inflammatory disease. Scientific reports dealing with phytochemical and  pharmacological research and its traditional have been reviewed. Reports have  also suggested that its prominent constituents viz. triterpenoids, sterols,  flavonoids and lactones originate from this plant arbitrate their effects by  modulating several therapeutic targets.Out of about 80 species of Pluchea, some  of them are on extinct and only 16 have traditional uses in several countries of  Asian, Middle East and North American region. The present review covers the  period 1935-2011.","According to the research paper 'Pluchea lanceolata (Rasana): Chemical and biological potential of Rasayana herb used in traditional system of medicine', there's this herb called Pluchea lanceolata, or Rasana, that's been used for a long time to help with inflammation. This plant has different components like triterpenoids, sterols, flavonoids and lactones which seem to be the secret behind its healing powers. There are around 80 types of this herb but some are extinct and only 16 are still used in traditional medicine, especially in Asia, the Middle East and North America. This is based on studies done from 1935 to 2011."
I've been hearing about these traditional remedies for COVID-19 symptoms. Do they actually work and are they safe to try?,"Background: The advancing etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of the  global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have prompted the medical  community to consider Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani as add-on preventive and  therapeutic options. Objective: To explore the effect of standalone or  integrative Traditional Formulations (TFs) on selected clinical symptoms and  biomarkers of COVID-19. Search strategy: Out of 465 articles identified from  PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with  1646 COVID-19 patients published from January 2020 to February 2022 were  included in the study. Inclusion criteria: RCTs that compared the effect of  standalone/integrative TFs in decoction, tablet, and powder forms with placebo  plus standard care (SC)/placebo/SC as controls involving mild to severe  symptomatic COVID-19 patients were included. Data extraction and analysis: Three  reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of each article based  on the inclusion after deleting duplicates. The relevant full texts were  retrieved and examined, and then their data were extracted and double-checked by  three independent reviewers using prepared data extraction forms. The primary  outcome variables were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, fever,  cough, dyspnea, myalgia, headache, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte  sedimentation rate (ESR), and D-dimer. Results: The effect of different TFs or  integrative TFs was more to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) than the controls. There was an increase in fever and  cough, a decrease in dyspnea, myalgia, headache, and ESR, no change in CRP, and  a slight increase in D-dimer as an effect of TFs. Conclusions: Integrative or  standalone TF may be the inexpensive preventive and therapeutic option to  inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and its clinical symptoms.","According to 'Traditional Formulations for Managing COVID-19: A Systematic Review', researchers have been looking into traditional medicine like Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani as extra ways to prevent and treat COVID-19. They looked at over 400 studies and found 17 that really dug deep into this idea. The studies used these traditional treatments alone or together with modern treatments on people with mild to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The results showed that these traditional treatments could help slow down the virus and manage symptoms like fever, cough, and body aches. It's like adding an extra layer of defense against the virus, and it's not too pricey either."
"So, cancer rates haven't changed much despite research and it's less common in the East, right? Could using something like Ayurveda, along with regular medicine, help lower my risk or improve treatment if I ever get it?","Recent statistics indicate that the overall cancer incidence in the United  States, in spite of billions of dollars spent on research each year, has not  changed significantly in the last half-century. Cancers of the prostate, breast,  lung, and colon, although most common in the Western world, are least common in  the Eastern world. Allopathic medicine commonly practiced currently is only 100  years old. Although traditional medicine has been around for thousands of years,  no integration exists between it and allopathic medicine. Ayurveda, the science  of long life and one of the most ancient medical systems still practiced on the  Indian subcontinent, can be used in combination with modern medicine to provide  better treatment of cancer. This review focuses on the ayurvedic concept of the  causes of cancer and its linkage with inflammation, diagnosis, prevention, and  treatment. How ayurvedic medicine can be integrated with allopathic medicine is  also discussed in this review.","According to 'From ancient medicine to modern medicine: ayurvedic concepts of health and their role in inflammation and cancer', despite all the money and research we put into finding a cure for cancer, the rates haven't really changed much in the US over the last 50 years. Interestingly, common cancers like prostate, breast, lung, and colon are less common in Eastern countries. This paper suggests that we might be able to learn a thing or two from traditional medicines like Ayurveda, which is an ancient health practice from India. By combining some of these old school practices with our modern medicine, we might be able to improve cancer treatment and prevention."
I've been trying out some Ayurvedic remedies lately. Could they have any harmful stuff in them like heavy metals or something?,"Although the majority of published cases of lead poisoning come from  occupational exposures, some traditional remedies may also contain toxic amounts  of lead. Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that is native to India  and is used in many parts of world as an alternative to standard treatment  regimens. Here, we report the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented with  abdominal pain, anemia, liver function abnormalities, and an elevated blood lead  level. The patient was found to have been taking the Ayurvedic medicine  Jambrulin prior to presentation. Chemical analysis of the medication showed high  levels of lead. Following treatment with an oral chelating agent, the patient's  symptoms resolved and laboratory abnormalities normalized. This case highlights  the need for increased awareness that some Ayurvedic medicines may contain  potentially harmful levels of heavy metals and people who use them are at risk  of developing associated toxicities.","According to 'Ayurvedic herbal medicine and lead poisoning', some traditional Indian medicines, like Ayurveda, might have dangerous levels of lead in them. The study talks about a woman who got sick with stomach pain, anemia, and liver issues because she was taking an Ayurvedic medicine called Jambrulin, which was found to have a lot of lead. After she stopped taking it and got treatment, she got better. So, if you're thinking about trying these kinds of alternative medicines, be careful. They might have harmful stuff in them that could make you really sick."
I've been feeling super stressed and anxious lately. Are there any natural remedies or herbs that could help me out?,"In Ayurveda, the age-old Indian traditional system of medicine, health is  considered to be achieved as equilibrium of physical and mental wellbeing and  brain related ailments are recognized as 'Vatavyadi'. Rasayana herbs were mainly  used for pharmacological treatment of neurological diseases and Tinospora  cordifolia is one of the popular Rasayana herbs of Ayurveda. The traditional  claims of therapeutic activity of this herb for treatment of fever, diabetes,  anxiety, immunodeficiency, memory deficit and psychological problems have been  explored by different research groups using reverse pharmacology and advance  technological approaches.

I've been hearing a lot about diabetes and obesity recently. Are there any natural approaches or lifestyle changes that could help prevent these health problems?,"BACKGROUND: Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are increasing to  epidemic proportions globally. Prameha is a syndrome described in the ancient  Ayurvedic texts that includes clinical conditions involved in obesity,  prediabetes, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various dietary, lifestyle, and psychologic factors are  involved in the etiology of Prameha, particularly in relation to disturbances in  fat and carbohydrate metabolism. RESULTS: The Ayurvedic management of Prameha emphasizes dietary and lifestyle  recommendations and herbal preparations, in accordance with the  psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. Ayurveda also addresses the  management of psychologic factors that contribute to the development of Prameha.  Ayurvedic treatment known as Apatarpana (balanced diet with restricted calories)  and Santarpana (highly nutritious, high-calorie diet intended to increase  weight) are recommended for patients with type 2 and type 1 diabetes,  respectively. Various Ayurvedic herbs and herbomineral formulations are  utilized, based on the stage and type of disease as well as the  psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. A large body of research has been  conducted on these Ayurvedic herbs. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating the theory and modalities of Ayurveda in the management  of these disorders may prove to be beneficial.","According to 'Prameha in Ayurveda: correlation with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. Part 2--management of Prameha', the global rise in obesity and diabetes can be addressed using traditional Ayurvedic methods. This ancient practice suggests that what we eat, how we live, and even our mental state can cause health issues. The Ayurvedic approach involves personalized diets and lifestyle changes, alongside certain herbs. For instance, if you're dealing with type 2 diabetes, a balanced diet with fewer calories might be suggested. On the other hand, if you have type 1 diabetes, a nutritious, high-calorie diet could be the way to go. So, integrating Ayurveda into our healthcare might be"
I've heard that some herbs can help control seizures like in epilepsy. Do you know any that are mentioned in Ayurveda?,"The understanding of epilepsy has progressed since its earliest impression as a  disease associated with paranormal and superstitious beliefs. Landmark advances  have been made in deciphering the pathophysiological substrates involved in the  disease process, and treatment advances have contributed significantly to  ameliorating the seizures. However, disease-modifying agents are yet to be  discovered. Ayurveda is a system of medicine that stresses a holistic approach  to disease, and treatment is focused on disease modification and symptom  management. Herbs form the core of Ayurveda medicine; though many of them have  been studied for their anticonvulsant activity, very few actually mention the  reference of these herbs in Ayurveda literature. Other therapeutic interventions  used in Ayurveda are relatively unexplored, and future research will need to  focus on this. The current manuscript briefly discusses the understanding of  epilepsy as per Ayurveda and reviews herbs that have been studied for their  anticonvulsant activity mentioned in Ayurveda literature. This article is part  of a Special Issue entitled ""Botanicals for Epilepsy"".","According to 'Ayurveda and botanical drugs for epilepsy: Current evidence and future prospects', our understanding of epilepsy - a condition that can cause seizures - has come a long way from when people thought it was caused by supernatural stuff. Now, we use different treatments that can help control these seizures. Yet, we're still trying to find treatments that can completely change the course of the disease. The practice of Ayurveda, an ancient type of medicine, uses a more holistic approach, trying to treat the whole person rather than just the disease. It uses herbs as a main part of treatment, and some of these have been found to help control seizures. However, we don't know much about other treatments used in Ayurveda, so more research"
"I've been having trouble remembering stuff lately, is there any natural remedy that could help boost my memory?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sarasvata ghrita (SG), a polyherbal formulation  from ayurveda, an ancient medicinal system of India, has been used to improve  intelligence and memory, treat speech delay, speaking difficulties and low  digestion power in children. AIM OF THE STUDY: Study aimed to validate the ethno use of SG in memory  enhancement through systematic scientific protocol. The effect of SG and modern  extracts of ingredients of SG was compared on cognitive function and  neuroprotection in amyloid-β peptide 25-35(Aβ25-35) induced memory impairment in  wistar rats. Further the underlying mechanism for neuroprotective activity was  investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SG was prepared as per traditional method, ethanolic  extract (EE) was prepared by conventional method and lipid based extract was  prepared by modern extraction method. All extracts were standardised by newly  developed HPLC method with respect to marker compounds. SG, EE and LE were  administered orally to male Wistar rats at doses of 100,200 and 400 mg/kg Body  Weight by feeding needle for a period of 21 days after the  intracerebroventricular administration of Aβ25-35 bilaterally. Spatial memory of  rats was tested using Morris water maze (MWM) and Radial arm maze (RAM) test.  The possible underlying mechanisms for the cognitive improvement exhibited by  SG, EE and LE was investigated through ex-vivo brain antioxidant effect,  monoamine level estimation, acetylcholine esterase (AchE) inhibitory effect and  Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels estimation. RESULTS: SG, EE and LE were analyzed by HPLC method, results showed that EE  extract has high percent of selected phytoconstituents as compared with SG and  LE. SG and LE decrease escape latency and searching distance in a dose dependant  manner during MWM test. In case of RAM significant decrease in number of errors  and increase in number of correct choices indicate an elevation in retention and  recall aspects of learning and memory after administration of SG an LE. SG and  LE extract can efficiently prevent accumulation of β-amyloid plaque in  hippocampus region. There was increase in SOD, GSH, CAT and NO level and  decrease in MDA levels in SG and LE administered animals. SG and LE have found  to exhibit AchE inhibitiory activity and significant dose-dependant increase in  BDNF level in the plasma. SG and LE significantly increased the levels of  noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain. CONCLUSION: The study validated the neuroprotective activity of SG. The study  concludes the extraction efficiency of SG for selected phytoconstituents is less  than modern methods. However the neuroprotective activity of SG and LE was found  to be greater than EE.","According to 'Validation of ethnopharmacology of ayurvedic sarasvata ghrita and comparative evaluation of its neuroprotective effect with modern alcoholic and lipid based extracts in β-amyloid induced memory impairment', an Indian herbal mix called Sarasvata Ghrita (SG) has been tested on lab rats and shown to improve memory and brain health. In simple words, this mix is like a brain-boosting supplement which was given to the rats and then their memory was tracked using different mazes. It was found that the rats who took this herbal mix showed better memory skills. They also found that SG helps increase some good stuff in the brain that protects it from damage. What's interesting is that even though modern methods extract more goodies"
"I've been super stressed lately, could a head massage help me feel more relaxed and refreshed?","OBJECTIVE: To clarify the physical and psychological effects of head massage  performed in the supine position using Ayurveda-based techniques (head  treatment). DESIGN: Twenty-four healthy female students were included in the study. Using a  crossover study design, the same participants were enrolled in both the head  treatment intervention group and control group. There was an interval of 1 week  or more between measurements. OUTCOME MEASURES: The physiologic indices measured included blood pressure and  heart rate fluctuations (high frequency and low frequency/high frequency). The  psychological markers measured included liveliness, depression, and boredom  using the visual analogue scale method. State anxiety was measured using the  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory method. RESULTS: The parasympathetic nerve activity increased immediately after head  treatment. Upon completion of head treatment, the parasympathetic nerve  predominance tended to gradually ease. Head treatment boosted freshness and  relieved anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that head treatment has a relaxing and  refreshing effect and may be used to provide comfort.","According to 'Physical and Psychological Effects of Head Treatment in the Supine Position Using Specialized Ayurveda-Based Techniques', getting a head massage using certain techniques can make you feel more relaxed and refreshed. This study found that these massages can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more lively. So, if you're feeling stressed or low, a good head massage might just be what you need."
I've heard about this herb called Ashwagandha that people take for general health. Is it safe to use on a regular basis?,"BACKGROUND: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a well-established and reputed  herb in Ayurvedic medicine. It has been used as a ""Rasayana"" (rejuvenator),  nootropic, and as a powerful natural adaptogen. The herb extract is extensively  used for general wellbeing and in specific ailments. However, only a few studies  have investigated the safety and tolerability of Ashwagandha in humans. This  study evaluated the safety of Ashwagandha root extract consumption in healthy  adults. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and  parallel-group study, 80 healthy participants (40 males, 40 females) were  randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ashwagandha 300 mg or a placebo of  the same dosage, twice daily, orally for 8 weeks. The study was conducted at MV  Hospital, and King George Medical University, Lucknow, India. The primary safety  outcomes considered were laboratory assessment of hematological parameters,  serum biochemistry analysis including hepatotoxicity evaluation, and thyroid  function parameters. The secondary outcomes of this study were the clinical  adverse events and the vital parameters. The within and between the groups'  datasets were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann Whitney  U test, respectively. RESULTS: A detailed evaluation of the vital signs such as body weight, body  temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood  pressure, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were conducted for each participant at the  baseline and the end of the study for treatment and placebo groups. Similarly,  hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the baseline and at  the end of study. The outcome did not indicate any untoward effects in any of  the treated volunteers. No statistically significant change or abnormality was  observed in the considered parameters including thyroid hormonal profile in both  the groups. No adverse events were reported by any of the participants in this  study. CONCLUSIONS: Ashwagandha is being consumed since time immemorial following the  Ayurvedic medicine practices. Modern science requires evidence of the safety and  efficacy of the Ashwagandha extract before mass consumption for various health  issues and as a supplement. The present study revealed that the consumption of  Ashwagandha root extract for 8 weeks was safe in both males and females  volunteers. However, long term study and varying dosage ranges should be  investigated in the future.","According to 'Safety of Ashwagandha Root Extract: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, study in Healthy Volunteers', Ashwagandha is a herb that's been used for a long time in traditional medicine for various health benefits. This study tested how safe it is for healthy people to use. They gave 80 people either Ashwagandha or a pretend pill (placebo) twice a day for 8 weeks. They checked things like blood pressure, body weight and blood tests to make sure nothing bad was happening. They found no significant changes or problems in the people taking Ashwagandha. So, it seems like Ashwagandha is pretty safe to take, but they suggest more research is"
I've been using some traditional Asian herbal remedies lately. Could they potentially have harmful stuff like mercury or lead in them?,"Traditional herbal preparations used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine,  traditional Tibetan medicine, and other Asian traditional medicine systems may  contain significant amounts of mercury, arsenic or lead. Though deliberately  incorporated in Asian traditional herbal preparations for therapeutic purposes,  these constituents have caused intoxications worldwide. The aim of this study  was therefore to determine mercury, arsenic, and lead levels in Asian  traditional herbal preparations on the Dutch market. A total of 292 traditional  herbal preparations used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and  traditional Tibetan medicine were sampled between 2004 and 2007. Samples were  mostly multi-ingredient traditional herbal preparations containing herbs and  minerals. The labeling of less than 20% of the traditional herbal preparations  suggested the presence of mercury, arsenic or lead. These elements were shown by  inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in 186 (64%) of 292 traditional  herbal preparations. Estimated weekly mercury, arsenic, and lead intake levels  were calculated for each traditional herbal preparation from the analytically  determined concentrations and the recommended dose. A total of 59 traditional  herbal preparations (20%) were likely to result in intakes of these elements  significantly exceeding safety limits. Of these 59 traditional herbal  preparations, intake estimates for 50 traditional herbal preparations  significantly exceeded the safety limit for mercury (range = 1.4-1747 mg  week(-1)); intake estimates for 26 traditional herbal preparations significantly  exceeded the safety limit for arsenic (range = 0.53-427 mg week(-1)) and intake  estimates for eight traditional herbal preparations were significantly above the  safety limit for lead (range = 2.6-192 mg week(-1)). It is concluded that the  mercury, arsenic, and lead contents of traditional herbal preparations used in  Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Tibetan medicine remain  a cause for concern and require strict control.","According to 'Monitoring of mercury, arsenic, and lead in traditional Asian herbal preparations on the Dutch market and estimation of associated risks', some traditional herbal remedies from Asia, such as those used in Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, might contain harmful levels of mercury, arsenic, or lead. Even though these elements are part of the remedy recipes, they can be harmful and cause poisoning. The study looked at nearly 300 such remedies sold in the Netherlands and found that about 20% could result in taking in more of these elements than is safe. Therefore, if you're considering using these types of remedies, be careful and make sure you know what's in them."
"So, I've heard about these things from Ayurveda, Chandraprabha Vati and Maha yogaraja Guggulu. Are they any good at getting rid of harmful stuff in my body, like free radicals?","Two polyherbal formulations of Ayurveda viz., Chandraprabha Vati and Maha  yogaraja Guggulu were evaluated for their free radical scavenging properties.  Methanolic extracts of the formulations were studied in four different in vitro  and ex vivo models. Total phenolic content of Chandraprabha Vati and Maha  yogaraja Guggulu was found to be 5.24% and 10.74% respectively. Methanolic  extracts of the formulations were good scavengers of all the radicals but there  was a difference in the activity of the two formulations in different models.  Chandraprabha Vati was a good scavenger of superoxide radical and Maha yogaraja  Guggulu was efficient in scavenging nitric oxide (NO), while both inhibited  lipid peroxidation efficiently. Free radical scavenging activity of the  different extracts can be attributed to the presence of various chemical  components including phenolics.","According to 'Evaluation of free radical scavenging properties of two classical polyherbal formulations', two traditional Ayurvedic herbal mixes, Chandraprabha Vati and Maha yogaraja Guggulu, have been found to have antioxidant properties. Basically, they help your body in fighting off harmful substances called free radicals. Chandraprabha Vati is particularly good at fighting a type of free radical called superoxide, while Maha yogaraja Guggulu is really good at dealing with another type called nitric oxide. Both of these mixes are also good at preventing damage to fats in the body. These benefits might be due to the presence of natural chemicals, including phenolics, in these Ayurvedic mixes."
"So, I've been hearing about this Ayurveda thing and how it can help detect early signs of cancer. Can you explain how this works?","The term Kriyakala refers to the recognition of the stage of a disease's  progress, which helps to determine appropriate measure to correct the imbalance  in Doshas (biological factors). It is a compound expression, comprised of Kriya  and Kala, where Kriya means the choice to treatment (medicine, food and  daily-routine) used to improve the disturbance in Doshas, and Kala refers to the  stage of progress of a disease. Sushruta, an ancient Indian surgeon, has  described the concept of Kriyakala in Varnaprashnadhyaya, an ancient Vedic  Sanskrit text, which seeks to explain the incidence of Varnas in terms of Doshic  disturbances. Varna, in modern parlance, may be described as an inflammatory  process that may lead ulceration and chronic inflammation, promoting all stages  of carcinogenesis. Abnormal interactions between Prakriti (genotype) and  environmental factors vitiate the Doshas and impair immunity, which can lead to  aberrant cell growth and cancer. Moreover, the interaction between vitiated  Doshas and weak Dhatus (body tissues) manifests as cancers of a specific organ.  Shatkriyakala (six stages of progress of a disease), on the other hand, provides  a framework to assess the cancer and its pathogenesis in different stages.  According to Ayurvedic concepts, all cancer therapies treat the affected tissues  indirectly by eliminating vitiated Doshas, rejuvenating Dhatus and restoring  immunity in cancer patients. The present review describes the six stages of  Shatkriyakala in detail, with an emphasis on research areas to validate the  concept of Shatkriyakala. This traditional knowledge can be utilized with modern  technologies to detect predisposition for cancer or diagnose cancer in its early  stages.","According to the research paper 'Ayurvedic concept of Shatkriyakala: a traditional knowledge of cancer pathogenesis and therapy', the term Kriyakala is all about understanding where a disease, like cancer, is at. It's like tracking the disease's journey and making sure we use the right treatments at the right time. Back in the day, an ancient Indian surgeon named Sushruta explained this concept in an old text. He described how our body's natural balance can get messed up by things in our environment and even our own genetics, which can cause cells to grow abnormally and lead to cancer. The paper also talks about a six-stage process to keep tabs on how the disease is progressing. In Ayurvedic"
"Are there ways to get more natural health providers involved in maternal care, especially in places where there's a shortage of trained birth attendants?","BACKGROUND: Shortage of skilled birth attendants (SBA) is one of the  determinants of maternal mortality in India. To combat this shortage, innovative  task-shifting strategies to engage providers of the Indian system of medicine  (Ayurveda and Homeopathy), called AYUSH practitioners (AP), to provide SBA  services is being implemented. METHODS: Engagement of APs for SBA service provision was assessed in 3 states of  India (Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Odisha) through 73 in-depth interviews (37  with APs and 36 with programme managers). The interviews explored the providers'  SBA training experience, barriers for SBA service provision, workplace and  community acceptance, and the perspective of programme managers on the  competence and quality of SBA services provided. RESULTS: SBA training led to skill enhancement with adoption of appropriate  maternal and newborn care practices. A dedicated trainer, more hands-on  practice, and strengthening training on newborn care practices and management of  complications emerged as the training needs. Conditional involvement in  SBA-related work, a discriminatory attitude at the workplace and lack of  legal/regulatory authorisation were identified as barriers to the inclusion of  APs in SBA service provision. CONCLUSIONS: Quality skill enhancement measures, an enabling work environment, a  systematic task-shifting process, role definition, supportive supervision and  credentialing could be key for the integration of APs and their acceptance in  the health system.","According to 'Task-shifting challenges for provision of skilled birth attendance: a qualitative exploration', there's a big problem in India with not having enough professional help for women giving birth. To help with this, they're training practitioners of traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda and Homeopathy) to assist in the birthing process. The study found that this training is pretty effective, but more practice and training on newborn care is needed. Some of the challenges they face include not being fully accepted in their roles and needing more legal support. So, for this to work better, they need more quality training, clearer roles, more support, and recognition in the health system."
I've been hearing about this plant called Withania coagulans in Ayurveda. Can it really help improve my health and in what ways?,"OBJECTIVES: The use of Withania coagulans, a member of the solanaceae family,  has been highlighted in Ayurveda.

"I've been dealing with some stomach issues and skin problems. Is there a natural remedy, like a herb or plant, that could help with this?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Phyllanthus amarus Schum. & Thonn. belongs to  the family Euphorbiaceae is a small herb well known for its medicinal properties  and widely used worldwide. P. amarus is an important plant of Indian Ayurvedic  system of medicine which is used in the problems of stomach, genitourinary  system, liver, kidney and spleen. It is bitter, astringent, stomachic, diuretic,  febrifuge and antiseptic. The whole plant is used in gonorrhea, menorrhagia and  other genital affections. It is useful in gastropathy, diarrhoea, dysentery,  intermittent fevers, ophthalmopathy, scabies, ulcers and wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present review covers a literature across from 1980  to 2011. Some information collected from traditional Ayurvedic texts and  published literature on ethanomedicinal uses of Phyllanthus amarus in different  countries worldwide. RESULTS: Phytochemical studies have shown the presence of many valuable  compounds such as lignans, flavonoids, hydrolysable tannins (ellagitannins),  polyphenols, triterpenes, sterols and alkaloids. The extracts and the compounds  isolated from P. amarus show a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities  including antiviral, antibacterial, antiplasmodial, anti-inflammatory,  antimalarial, antimicrobial, anticancer, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic,  antioxidant, hepatoprotective nephroprotective and diurectic properties. CONCLUSION: The present review summarizes information concerning the morphology,  ecology, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological activities, clinical  applications and toxicological reports of P. amarus. This review aims at  gathering the research work undertaken till date on this plant in order to  provide sufficient baseline information for future works and commercial  exploitation.","According to 'Phyllanthus amarus: ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology: a review', there's a plant called Phyllanthus amarus that's pretty useful in traditional medicine, especially in India. It's known to help with a bunch of health problems like stomach issues, kidney troubles, and even some sexual health concerns. This plant has some cool properties, like fighting off viruses and bacteria, reducing inflammation, and protecting the liver and kidneys. It's even been found to have anti-cancer and anti-diabetic effects. So, this plant is kind of a big deal in the world of natural remedies."
"Is there a natural supplement or something that can help prevent this ""amyloidosis"" thing that I keep hearing about?","Lysozyme amyloidosis (ALys) is caused by the deposition of amyloid-like fibrils  of lysozyme in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys. The  treatment/prevention of ALys is not known yet. Therefore, searching for  therapeutic agents for amyloidosis is of great value. In this study, we have  examined the ability of the aqueous extract of herbalome (thirty herbal  components) of Chandraprabha vati (EHCV), a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, to  prevent fibrillation of lysozyme. Transmission electron microscopy and multiple  biophysical techniques were used to examine the processes. We found complete  inhibition of the fibrillation by EHCV, whereas none of the thirty ingredients  of EHCV was able to prevent the reaction, solely. We also found the EHCV induced  and stabilized secondary structures of aggregation-prone state (APS) of  lysozyme. Moreover, an increase in the secondary structure and stability of APS  were found to correlate with the inhibition reaction. We conclude that EHCV  modulates the structure and stability of APS and converts it into an aggregation  resistant state (ARS). We hypothesized that herbal components of Ayurvedic  formulation may provide a combination of molecules, which could efficiently  prevent aggregation reaction.","According to 'Herbalome of Chandraprabha vati, a polyherbal formulation of Ayurveda prevents fibrillation of lysozyme by stabilizing aggregation-prone intermediate state', there is a condition called Lysozyme amyloidosis that's caused by too much of a certain protein building up in your body, specifically in places like your stomach, liver, and kidneys. Right now, scientists aren't sure how to treat or prevent it. But, they've been looking at a herbal mix used in Ayurvedic medicine called Chandraprabha vati. In the study, they found that this mix stopped the protein from building up. Interestingly, none of the individual herbs in the mix could do this on their own"
"I've heard that some plants can help with diabetes. Is there any truth to this, like something natural I could try?","BACKGROUND: In spite of the tremendous progress achieved in medical sciences in  the last century, the management of diabetes mellitus, a disease as old as  mankind, is poor. Diabetes is currently the world's largest endocrine disorder,  and estimates are that it affects almost 5% of the population. Ayurveda, the  Indian traditional system of medicine, is one of the world's oldest systems to  have documented the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. METHODS: Experimental studies performed in accordance with the modern medicine  principles have shown that some of the medicinal plants and polyherbal  preparations made using the plants used in Ayurveda are effective in preventing  both hyperglycemia and its complications. Syzygium jambolanum (Syn Syzygium  cumini, Eugenia cumini, Eugenia jambolana), commonly known as black plum and  originally indigenous to India, is one of the important antidiabetic plants. RESULTS: Jamun has been used in various complementary and alternative systems of  medicine and, before the discovery of insulin, was a frontline antidiabetic  medication even in Europe. The brew prepared by boiling the Jamun seeds in  boiling water has been used in the various traditional systems of medicine in  India. CONCLUSIONS: This review includes the validated antidiabetic effects of Jamun  and some of its compounds. Emphasis is also placed on addressing the various  mechanisms of action contributing to the pharmacological effects and the aspects  that need future investigations for Jamun to be of clinical use.","According to 'Scientific validation of the antidiabetic effects of Syzygium jambolanum DC (black plum), a traditional medicinal plant of India', the black plum, also known as Jamun, can be really good for people with diabetes. This fruit, native to India, has been used as a natural way to treat diabetes for a long time, even before insulin was discovered. Some studies have shown that drinking a tea made from boiling Jamun seeds can help control high blood sugar levels. However, more research is needed to fully understand how it works and how it could be used in modern medicine."
"I've been dealing with back pain for a while now, do you think Ayurvedic massage could help make it better?","OBJECTIVES: Ayurveda is one of the oldest comprehensive healthcare systems  worldwide. Ayurvedic massage and physical therapy are frequently used to treat  patients with chronic pain syndromes and disorders of the musculoskeletal  system. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic massage in  nonspecific chronic low back pain by means of a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN: Sixty-four patients (mean age, 54.8 years; 49 women and 15 men) with  chronic low back pain who scored >40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)  were randomly assigned to a 2-week massage group with 6 hours of Ayurvedic  massage and external treatment (n = 32) or to a 2-week local thermal therapy  group (n = 32). The study observation period was 4 weeks, consisting of a 2-week  intervention phase followed by a 2-week follow-up phase. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was the change of mean pain (VAS) from  baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included pain-related bothersomeness, the  Roland Disability Questionnaire, quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item  Short Form), the Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire for measuring back  pain-related disability, and psychological outcomes. Outcomes were assessed at  baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Mean back pain (primary outcome) at week 2 was significantly reduced  from 53.4 ± 18.5 to 21.6 ± 18.2 in the massage group and from 55.3 ± 12.9 to  41.8 ± 19.8 in the standard thermal therapy group (mean group difference, -18.7;  95% confidence interval, -28.7 to -8.7; p < 0.001). While beneficial effects on  pain-related bothersomeness and psychological well-being were also apparent, the  Ayurvedic intervention did not improve function or disability in the short-term  observation period. Both programs were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic external treatment is effective for pain-relief in  chronic low back pain in the short term. Further studies with longer observation  periods are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of the Ayurvedic external  treatment approach on function and disability.","According to the study 'Effectiveness of Ayurvedic Massage (Sahacharadi Taila) in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial,' Ayurvedic massage can be really helpful if you're dealing with chronic low back pain. The researchers compared people who got Ayurvedic massages to those who only received heat treatments for their back pain. After 2 weeks, the massage group experienced a big drop in their pain levels compared to the heat treatment group. But, the massages didn't really improve their ability to move around better or reduce disability. The researchers suggest that more studies are needed to see if these massages can have long-term benefits. So, if your back has been killing you for a while, you might"
I've been taking some herbal supplements from a traditional Ayurvedic practice. Could these be causing me to feel sick or could they be harmful in any way?,"BACKGROUND: Use of alternative medications and herbal remedies is widespread in  the United States and across the globe. These traditional medications can be  contaminated with toxic metals. Despite several case reports of poisoning from  such contamination, the epidemiological data are still limited. OBJECTIVES: To report on a cluster of lead and mercury toxicity cases in 2011  among a community of adherents of traditional medical practice of Ayurveda. METHODS: Adherents of Ayurveda were offered heavy metals screening following the  identification of the index case. RESULTS: Forty-six of 115 participants (40%) had elevated blood lead levels  (BLLs) of 10 μg/dl or above, with 9.6% of BLLs at or above 50 μg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cluster of lead and mercury toxicity following  use of Ayurvedic supplements described in the literature in the US.  Contamination of herbal products is a public health issue of global  significance. There are few regulations addressing contamination of ""natural""  products or supplements.","According to 'A cluster of lead poisoning among consumers of Ayurvedic medicine', using alternative medicines and herbal remedies, like those from Ayurvedic practices, can actually be pretty risky. In 2011, a community who were big on Ayurveda were tested for heavy metals, and almost half of them had high levels of lead in their blood. Some even had dangerous amounts. This is the biggest group of lead and mercury poisoning cases in the U.S. linked to Ayurvedic supplements. So, this highlights a big issue - there's not enough regulation on 'natural' products and supplements, which can sometimes be contaminated with harmful stuff. So, be careful when choosing to use these kind of remedies."
"I've heard that Shilajit can help with energy and focus, but is it safe to use? I'm worried about stuff like heavy metals.","‏Shilajit is used commonly as Ayurvedic medicine worldwide which is Rasayana  herbo-mineral substance and consumed to restore the energetic balance and to  prevent diseases like cognitive disorders and Alzheimer. Locally, Shilajit is  applied for patients diagnosed with bone fractures. For safety of the patients,  the elemental analysis of Shilajit is imperative to evaluate its nutritional  quality as well as contamination from heavy metals. The elemental composition of  Shilajit was conducted using three advanced analytical techniques (LIBS, ICP,  and EDX). For the comparative studies, the two Shilajit kinds mostly sold  globally produced in India and Pakistan were collected. Our main focus is to  highlight nutritional eminence and contamination of heavy metals to hinge on  Shilajit therapeutic potential. In this work, laser-induced breakdown  spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the  Shilajit. Our LIBS analysis revealed that Shilajit samples composed of several  elements like Ca, S, K, Mg, Al, Na, Sr, Fe, P, Si, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Co,  Pb, Cu, As, Hg, Se, and Ti. Indian and Pakistani Shilajits were highly enriched  with Ca, S, and K nutrients and contained Al, Sr, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Pb, As,  and Hg toxins in amounts that exceeded the standard permissible limit. Even  though the content of most elements was comparable among both Shilajits,  nutrients, and toxins, in general, were accentuated more in Indian Shilajit with  the sole detection of Hg and Ti. The elemental quantification was done using  self-developed calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS)  method, and LIBS results are in well agreement with the concentrations  determined by standard ICP-OES/MS method. To verify our results by LIBS and  ICP-OES/MS techniques, EDX spectroscopy was also conducted which confirmed the  presence above mentioned elements. This work is highly significant for creating  awareness among people suffering due to overdose of this product and save many  human lives.","According to 'Rapid Determination and Quantification of Nutritional and Poisonous Metals in Vastly Consumed Ayurvedic Herbal Medicine (Rejuvenator Shilajit) by Humans Using Three Advanced Analytical Techniques', Shilajit, a popular Ayurvedic medicine, contains a bunch of different elements. While some of these elements are good for you (like calcium and potassium), others can be harmful in large amounts, like lead and mercury. The study found that Shilajit from India and Pakistan have high levels of these elements, with Indian Shilajit having slightly more. This is important to know because people could get sick from taking too much of this medicine. So, if you're using Shilajit"
"So, I've been trying to lose some weight. Can a diet based on my Ayurvedic body type really help me shed those pounds?","CONTEXT: Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medical system, is receivingincreasing  attention worldwide. OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study was conducted to determine the effectiveness  ofAyurvedic constitution-based diets on weight loss patterns of obese adults.  DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: Records of 200 obese adults, both  male and female, who had completed 3 months of the diet therapy at Ayurvedic  clinics, were examined and data collated. Techniques used included a checklist  of personality traits, physical signs, and food likes and dislikes to determine  the dosha. Based on the predominant doshas, diets were prescribed and closely  monitored for a period of 3 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Records of height and weight and chest, abdominal, waist, arm,  and thigh circumferences noted initially and after each month for the period of  3 months were obtained. RESULTS: Among the 200 subjects, 55 (27.5%) were vatta-, 83 (41.5%) were pitta-,  and 62 (31.0%) were kapha-predominant. At the beginning, kapha and pitta people  were heavier than vatta people. After the 3 months of therapy, the pitta group  lost the most weight (9.84%). The decrease in all the anthropometric  measurements was higher in pitta and kapha people than in vatta individuals.  Hence, diets based on Ayurvedic constitution may prove useful in promoting  weight loss. Though these promising findings support traditional Indian  Ayurvedic scriptures, more closely controlled trials are needed to substantiate  these findings.","According to 'Diets based on Ayurvedic constitution--potential for weight management', the traditional Indian approach to health, Ayurveda, might help you lose weight. This study looked at 200 people who followed Ayurvedic diets for three months. In Ayurveda, people are categorized into three types - vatta, pitta, and kapha - based on different traits and preferences. The study found that people from the pitta and kapha groups, who were heavier to start with, lost more weight compared to the vatta group. So, it seems like these Ayurveda-inspired diets could be a cool way to manage weight. But, more research is needed to make sure these findings hold up in different settings."
"My family always seems to have different health advice. How can I combine different medical traditions like yoga, homeopathy, and biomedicine for my health?","The transmission of traditional medical knowledge - either institutionally or  through established lineages - is assumed to involve one single tradition or  another. In India however, families of doctors often engage with multiple  traditions, including Ayurveda, Unani, homeopathy, yoga, and biomedicine.  Parents, children, siblings and spouses trained in different medical systems  occasionally share knowledge and clinical space, producing versatile therapies.  By exploring such cases, I challenge studies focused on single traditions and  propose to examine ""family space"" as the physical and relational proximity that  enables kin doctors to experiment with plural therapies while negotiating  legitimacy and authority within the changing institution of the Indian family.","According to 'Doctors of Plural Medicine, Knowledge Transmission, and Family Space in India', in India, it's not uncommon for families of doctors to know and use a mix of different types of medicine like Ayurveda, homeopathy, and even yoga. They often share what they know with each other and even work together, which lets them come up with a wide range of treatment options. This challenges the idea that medical knowledge is usually passed down within just one tradition. It also shows how these families of doctors are changing the game in the Indian medical world."

"I've heard about Ayurveda and yoga being good for your health, but does it actually help with things like heart disease or high blood pressure?","Ayurveda is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, namely, ""Ayus"" and ""Veda,"" meaning  life and knowledge, respectively. It literally means science of life. Ayurveda,  of which yoga is an integral part, is widely practiced in India and is gaining  acceptance in many countries around the world. It is a comprehensive and a  holistic system, the focus of which is on the body, mind, and consciousness. The  Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal preparations, diet, yoga,  meditation, and other practices. Based on the review of available studies, the  evidence is not convincing that any Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective in  the treatment of heart disease or hypertension. However, the use of certain  spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in an overall healthy diet is  appropriate. Many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners show promise and could  be appropriate for larger randomized trials. Yoga, an integral part of Ayurveda,  has been shown to be useful to patients with heart disease and hypertension.  Yoga reduces anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life. Its  safety profile is excellent. Its use as a complementary therapeutic regimen  under medical supervision is appropriate and could be worth considering.","According to 'Ayurveda and yoga in cardiovascular diseases', Ayurveda, a traditional Indian way of healthy living that includes yoga, herbs, diet, and meditation, doesn't have strong proof that it can treat heart disease or high blood pressure. However, including certain spices like garlic and turmeric in your everyday meals could be beneficial. Also, practicing yoga has shown to help people with heart issues and high blood pressure by reducing anxiety and improving their quality of life. It's safe and can be considered as an additional treatment under doctor's supervision."
"I've been thinking about trying some Ayurvedic medicines, but I've heard some might have heavy metals in them. Is that something I should be worried about?","Fifteen Ayurvedic medicines of Ras-family (herbo-mineral-metallic preparations)  from three reputed manufactures were analysed for elemental quantification and  their chemical phase identification using the energy-dispersive (ED) and  wavelength-dispersive (WD) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques, and powder X-ray  diffraction (XRD) technique, respectively. The low-Z elements C, H, N, S and O  constituting a major portion of these medicines were also determined by CHNSO  analyser and further used as input for XRF analyses. The elements of concern,  Hg, Pb and As, are identified in different medicine products with disquiet  concentration values (maximum concentration values range ~ 4-10%) and that too  with substantial variations in the products from different manufacturers. These  elements are identified mainly in the cinnabar (α-HgS)/metacinnabar (β-HgS),  litharge (PbO) and alacranite (As4S4) phases in different medicines. Keeping in  view the high concentration of chemicals of the Hg, Pb and As elements in the  Ras-family medicines, it is vitally required to investigate their  bioaccessibility and surmise the associated toxicological aspects. It is  suggested that the formation of the bioaccessible toxic chemical forms of the  Hg, Pb and As elements be avoided during preparation of the mineral ingredients  or these soluble chemical forms be removed at suitable stage of the preparation.  In view of large variations observed for the Hg, Pb and As based ingredients in  the Ras family Ayurvedic medicine products from different manufacturers,  adequate quality control mechanisms and production regulations are recommended.","According to 'Elemental and Chemical Phase Analyses of Ras-Family Ayurvedic Medicinal Products', some Ayurvedic medicines from the Ras family have been found to contain worrying levels of heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and arsenic. The levels of these potentially harmful elements vary a lot between products from different manufacturers. This means that it's important to properly investigate how much of these elements can actually enter the body when taking these medicines, and what harm they could do. It's also suggested that these potentially harmful elements should be removed from the medicines during the making process if possible. Because of the large differences in these elements between different products, stronger regulations and quality control are recommended for these Ayurvedic medicines."
"So, if I catch COVID early, could adding Ayurveda treatments to the usual meds help me feel better faster?","The retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of  Ayurveda treatment exposure as an add-on to conventional care in early stage  COVID-19 patients admitted at Samaras COVID care center, Ahmedabad, India.  Conventional care included Vitamin-c, Azithromycin, and Paracetamol. Ayurveda  formulations used as add-on were Dashamula and Pathyadi decoctions along with  Trikatu powder, Sanshamani tablet, AYUSH-64 tablet AND Yastimadhu Ghana tablet  for oral administration. Considering Add-on Ayurveda medicines as exposure of  interest, patients who received Add-on Ayurveda medicines at least for 7 days  were included in the exposed group while those who received only conventional  care in unexposed group. Data was collected through record review and telephonic  interviews. The outcomes of interest were the development of symptoms, duration  of symptomatic phase in those progressing to symptomatic stage and mortality.  Total 762 participants were included-[541 (71%) in the exposed group and 221  (29%) in the unexposed. Progression to symptomatic phase did not differ  significantly between groups [27.6% in exposed, 24.6% in unexposed, adjusted RR  0.85; 95% CI 0.6-1.2]. The total duration of symptomatic phase among those  progressing to the symptomatic stage was significantly decreased in the exposed  group (x¯ = 3.66 ± 1.55 days in exposed (n = 133); x¯ = 5.34 ± 3.35 days in  unexposed (n = 61), p < 0.001). No mortality was observed in either of the  groups. Ayurveda Treatment as adjunctive to conventional care reduced the  duration of symptomatic phase in early stage COVID-19 as compared to standalone  conventional care. Add-on Ayurveda treatment has promising potential for  management of early stage COVID-19.","According to the research paper 'Add-on Ayurveda Treatment for Early Stage COVID-19: A Single Center Retrospective Cohort Study From Gujarat, India', using traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) in addition to regular treatment might help early stage COVID-19 patients recover faster. The study found that patients who took Ayurveda medicine, on top of things like Vitamin-C, paracetamol, and Azithromycin, had a shorter time being sick. This suggests that Ayurveda could be a promising extra treatment for early stage COVID-19. No one in the study died, which is also great news."
"I've heard that Triphala can be good for gum health and cholesterol, but I've also heard it can go bad quickly. Is there a way to keep it from losing its effectiveness so fast?","Triphala is a well-known prescription in Indian Ayurveda and TCM medicine for  its great effect on gingivitis and hyperlipidemia. However, its solution is  unstable for the containing of excessive polyphenol, leading to the production  of sediment in the short term and the decrease of efficacy. Based on the  analysis of sediment formation, a novel control strategy is proposed. To conduct  the analysis, the sediment formation was recorded for a consecutive five days.  The changes in the composition of the supernatant and the sediment were studied  by the HPLC profile analysis. The main components of the sediment were  identified as corilagin, ellagic acid and gallic acid, and the amount of ellagic  acid sediment increased with the storage time. Then, with a series of pH status  adjustments of the Triphala solution, the physical and chemical stabilities were  acquired by Turbiscan and HPLC respectively. The results showed that as the pH  value increased, so did the physical stability, but the particle size and TSI of  the association decreased. While the fingerprint of chemical profile similarity  decreased, so did the chemical stability. Combining physical and chemical  stability parameters, an equilibrium point was found out. When the pH value was  adjusted to 5.0, both the physical and chemical stabilities were better: the  verification test showed that the sedimentation inhibition rates on the 3rd,  5th,10th and15th days were 41%, 55%, 41%, and 23%, respectively. This manuscript  provided a new control strategy that will pique pharmaceutical and food  development engineers' interest and trigger research ideas controlling the  quality of decoction.","According to the research paper 'Study on the stability control strategy of Triphala solution based on the balance of physical stability and chemical stabilities', Triphala is a popular treatment in Indian natural medicine for gum disease and high cholesterol. But there's a bit of a problem with it - it doesn't stay good for long. This is because it contains lots of polyphenols, which cause it to form a sort of sediment or solid bits, making it less effective. The scientists in this study looked at this sediment issue over five days and figured out what was causing it. They found that by changing the pH (which is like the level of acidity) of the Triphala solution to 5.0, they could make the solution more"

Are traditional doctors and alternative medicine doctors equally likely to recommend treatments like homeopathy or Ayurveda?,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the attitude toward  complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) of primary care physicians trained  in conventional medicine with CAM physicians whose training was for a comparable  duration. The CAM physicians included practitioners of Ayurveda, homeopathy, and  naturopathy. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and ninety five (295) physicians with aged 20-60  (group mean±standard deviation, 48.2-12.3 years, 87 females) participated.  Eighty-six (86) of them were trained in Ayurveda, 90 in homeopathy, 82 in  conventional medicine, and 37 in naturopathy. They were attending a 4-day  residential program on Indian culture. All of them gave their signed consent to  take part in the study, and the institution's ethics committee approved the  study. STUDY DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional survey. Since the participants had  self-selected to join for the program on Indian culture, the sampling could be  considered as convenience sampling. RESULTS: The number of conventionally trained and CAM physicians were similar in  number and in their reasons for selecting CAM treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Conventionally trained and CAM physicians were comparably likely to  prescribe CAM treatments for their patients. Their reasons for prescribing CAM  treatments appeared to be (1) the idea that CAM treatments deal with the cause,  and (2) a belief in the treatments. A limiting factor of the survey is that it  did not determine whether the belief was based on evidence or on faith alone.","According to 'Attitude of conventional and CAM physicians toward CAM in India', doctors who are trained in regular medicine and those trained in alternative methods like Ayurveda or homeopathy are pretty much the same when it comes to using alternative treatments. Their main reasons for choosing these treatments are because they believe they tackle the root cause of health issues and because they have faith in these methods. This study didn't look into if their belief was based on solid evidence or just on faith, so that's something to think about."
I've been hearing a lot about homeopathy and Ayurvedic treatments lately. Are they really that popular and do people find them effective for minor and major health issues?,"OBJECTIVES: Institute for Research in Medical Statistics, Indian Council of  Medical Research, Delhi undertook a study to obtain all India estimate of  utilization of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy (ISM&H).

Selected  districts in West Bengal were Midnapore and Darjeeling where about 2400 sick  persons from 2000 households were studied. RESULTS: About 20% sick persons actually availed ISM&H treatment in the State.  Majority availed Homeopathy followed by Ayurvedic medicines. Use of Unani and  Siddha is negligible in this State. In case of minor ailments, ISM&H was  preferred by about 15% in Darjeeling district and 42% in Midnapore district. In  case of serious illnesses, about 12% in Darjeeling district preferred ISM&H, but  very few (about 5%) preferred this in Midnapore. 39.4% and 20.8% of sick persons  sought treatment from traditional healers in Midnapore and Darjeeling district  respectively. Jaundice, snakebite, dog bite and 'bone setting' were some of the  conditions for which traditional healers were mostly visited. Sizable proportion  (30%-89%) of sick persons used various 'kitchen remedies' for conditions like  indigestion, loose motion, constipation, fever, body ache, sprain and cough &  cold.","According to 'A study on acceptability of Indian system of medicine and homeopathy in India: results from the State of West Bengal', about 20% of sick people in West Bengal, India actually use traditional Indian and homeopathic treatments.

"So, I have rheumatoid arthritis and I've heard about this Ayurvedic medicine. Does it actually work or is it just a bunch of hype?","OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on  the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Computerized literature searches for all RCTs of Ayurvedic medicine for  RA in the following databases: Medline (March 1969 to March 2003), Embase  (February 1985 to February 2003), AMED (March 1980 to March 2003), Cochrane  Controlled Trial Register (October 1997 to March 2003), and the abstract service  of Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS; 1976 to March  2003). Hand searches were performed in 1 Sri Lankan and 3 Indian journals and  the authors' personal files. Key data of included studies were extracted and  reviewed. The methodological quality of all studies was evaluated with the Jadad  scale. RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Trials tested either  Ayurvedic medicine against placebo or other Ayurvedic medicines. In general,  patient and physician global assessments on the severity of pain, and morning  stiffness were used as endpoints. Of 3 placebo-controlled RCTs, 1 high-quality  trial did not show benefit of the active treatment against placebo, while  another incompletely reported study indicated beneficial effects of an Ayurvedic  medicine. A further incompletely reported study showed no significant  difference. The remaining 4 trials were difficult to interpret because they  tested an Ayurvedic medicine against other Ayurvedic medicines whose effects  were not proven. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of RCTs of Ayurvedic medicines for RA. The  existing RCTs fail to show convincingly that such treatments are effective  therapeutic options for RA.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review', researchers looked at different trials involving Ayurvedic medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis. These trials compared Ayurvedic treatments to placebos or other Ayurvedic treatments. However, the results didn't clearly show that Ayurvedic treatments are effective for rheumatoid arthritis. In fact, one well-conducted trial showed no benefit from the treatment compared to a placebo. So, if you're considering Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis, keep in mind that more research is needed to prove its effectiveness."
I'm thinking about getting pregnant in the future. Are there any holistic or natural ways to prepare for a healthy pregnancy?,"The prevalence of pregnancy complications are on the rise globally with severe  consequences. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2009), every  minute, at least one woman dies and 20 are affected by the complications related  to pregnancy or childbirth. While the root cause of pregnancy complications is  unclear, it likely has physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects.  The Vedas are a rich source of antenatal health care guidelines in all these  aspects. The primary objective of the authors was to compile the scriptural and  scientific evidence for a holistic antenatal model of yoga with emphasis on  sociocultural Indian practices.","According to 'A holistic antenatal model based on yoga, Ayurveda, and Vedic guidelines', pregnancy complications are becoming more common worldwide and can have serious effects. Every minute, at least one woman dies and 20 others suffer from problems related to pregnancy or childbirth. While it's not totally clear why this is happening, it probably has to do with a mix of physical, emotional, social, and even spiritual factors. Ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas have a lot of advice on how to look after yourself when you're pregnant, focusing on all these areas. The researchers' main goal was to bring together all this advice and scientific evidence to create a full pregnancy care model based on yoga and traditional Indian practices."
"So, India is trying to incorporate alternative medicine into their healthcare system, right? What kind of challenges might they face when they start mixing traditional and modern medical practices?","The National Rural Health Mission has stated as one of its key mandates the  mainstreaming of the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy  (AYUSH) systems in order to help solve the human resource shortage in Indian  healthcare. This has been planned at the primary level by providing training to  AYUSH practitioners on primary care and national health programmes; at the  secondary level by establishing departments of AYUSH in the district and taluka  level hospitals; and at the tertiary level  by establishing AYUSH centres of  excellence as referral centres, and research, development and supervision  points. The practical challenges to be considered include a gross divergence in  the basic philosophy of practice; disparities in approach to specific clinical  conditions; differences in their normative approach in decision making; an  unclear policy for cross referral and problems of cross practice that could  potentially rise in this condition. Mainstreaming of AYUSH into the existing  public health system can have certain ethical implications: not doing good by  failing to concentrate on the community value judgments about AYUSH; doing harm  by a confusing plurality in approach and unhealthy segregation of practices  without healthy dialogue between practitioners of either system; not disclosing  which type of practitioners (AYUSH or allopathy) the patient is seeing; lack of  proper public accountability mechanisms at the primary care and grassroots  levels; and, finally, lack of social justice. These ethical issues have to be  considered while mainstreaming AYUSH.","According to 'Mainstreaming AYUSH: an ethical analysis', India's National Rural Health Mission wants to include more traditional health practices like Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) in the healthcare system. This is to help with the lack of healthcare workers. To do this, they plan to train AYUSH practitioners, set up more AYUSH departments in hospitals, and establish specialized AYUSH centers. However, they need to consider some challenges. These include differences in treatment approaches and decision making, unclear policies about referring patients, potential issues with mixing different practices, confusion for patients about who's treating them, lack of accountability at the grassroots level, and issues of"
I've been feeling really stressed and burnt out lately. Is there any natural Ayurvedic advice to help me feel more balanced and healthy?,"Ayurveda is a natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000  years ago. Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being  through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and  environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides  treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be  essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving  this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the  psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and  lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year. Common spices are  utilized in treatment, as well as herbs and herbal mixtures, and special  preparations known as Rasayanas are used for rejuvenation, promotion of  longevity, and slowing of the aging process. A group of purification procedures  known as Panchakarma removes toxins from the physiology. Whereas Western  allopathic medicine is excellent in handling acute medical crises, Ayurveda  demonstrates an ability to manage chronic disorders that Western medicine has  been unable to. It may be projected from Ayurveda's comprehensive approach,  emphasis on prevention, and ability to manage chronic disorders that its  widespread use would improve the health status of the world's population.","So, according to 'Utilization of Ayurveda in health care: an approach for prevention, health promotion, and treatment of disease. Part 1--Ayurveda, the science of life', Ayurveda is like a super old-school wellness routine from India that's all about living your best life. It's not just about curing sickness, but also about keeping you healthy in the first place. It's a holistic approach, meaning it takes care of your mind, body, behavior, and even your surroundings. Meditation is a key part of it, helping you gain a better state of mind. Everyone's treatment is personalized based on their own needs and even the time of year. They use common spices, herbs, and special blends for"
So I've been thinking about trying out some of these alternative medicines for my skin issues. Are they actually safe and do they really work?,"According to survey data, 35-69% of patients with skin disease have used  complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in their lifetime. A literature  search on this subject reveals a number of studies on the efficacy of CAM  treatment for dermatologic conditions, as well as a number of articles showing  the growing prevalence of CAM use amongst patients suffering from these  conditions. Given the consensus amongst these articles that dermatologists  require increased education on CAM, this paper presents an overview of some of  the most widely used systems of alternative medicine to serve as a tool for  practicing dermatologists. Specifically, the history and theory behind  psychocutaneous therapies, traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture),  homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine will be described, along with current  evidence for their efficacy and reports of their adverse effects. The authors  conclude that more evidence and better studies are needed for each of the major  CAM modalities before they may be considered as independent therapeutic options.  Moreover, given the shortage of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of  CAM, dermatologists should obtain a thorough history of CAM use from their  patients. In general, ingestible substances including most homeopathic,  Ayurvedic, and traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulations that are not US  FDA regulated should be viewed with caution as they may cause severe adverse  effects such as arsenicosis and hepatotoxicity. On the other hand, less invasive  techniques such as acupuncture and psychocutaneous therapies may be more  acceptable given their low-risk profile. Ultimately, until the availability of  more sound data, these treatments should primarily be used in combination with  conventional treatment and rarely independently.","According to 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Dermatology: An Overview of Selected Modalities for the Practicing Dermatologist', many people with skin conditions have tried out different types of alternative medicine. Some of these include mind-body therapies, traditional Chinese medicine like acupuncture, homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine. However, there's still a lot we don't know about how well these methods work and if they're safe. If you're thinking about trying one of these treatments, it's really important to talk to your doctor first, especially if the treatment involves taking something you eat or drink. Some of these, like certain herbal remedies, aren't regulated and could have serious side effects. On the other hand, treatments like acupuncture have fewer risks"
"I've been thinking about trying some herbal health supplements, but how can I be sure they're safe and effective?","Background: Regulatory affairs play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical  industry and are incorporated in all stages of drug development. Objective:  Approval criteria practices were developed as a resolution of the government's  desire to create policies to protect public health by controlling the safety and  efficacy of merchandise in areas including pharmaceuticals, complementary color  medicines, veterinary medicines, medical devices, and even food products and  cosmetics. Method: Herbal health products are in practices in all parts of the  world under either their legal system's or expert council's or agencies' guides.  They include botanicals, health supplements, health foods, complimentary  medicines, traditional medicines or following pathies like Ayurveda, Yoga,  Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The requisite parameters for registration or  recognition of products by various major global regulatory agencies were  reviewed, and compiled under purview. Results: In India, licensing these  products is under the act provisions and the rules known as the Drugs and  Cosmetics Act, whereas globally regulatory provisions follow the guidelines of  developed countries like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European  Medicines Agency, the Therapeutic Goods Act, or the World Health Organization's  regulations for herbal products. Conclusions: The present communication  highlights the provisions of regulatory and/or licensing requirements related to  corporates, product composition, specifications, quality parameters,  manufacturing methodology, stability, safety, preclinical studies, clinical  studies, etc. for herbal products and the respective guidelines at one site.  Highlights: Ultimately, all regulatory agencies across the world highlight  majorly the safety and thereafter the efficacy for any products under the  category.","According to 'Regulatory Aspects of Traditional Indian Medicines (TIM) in India and in International Purview', getting approval for health products like herbal supplements or things like Ayurveda practices, isn't just a free-for-all. All over the world, there are government groups that make sure these products are safe and actually do what they say they're going to do. This could be the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, or similar groups in other countries. These guys look at everything from what's in the product, how it's made, and even how it holds up over time. The main goal is to protect us, the consumers, making sure we're getting safe and effective products."
"I heard that Ayurvedic doctors personalize treatments based on certain principles. But does this really happen, or is it just a theory?","BACKGROUND: The curricula of Ayurveda programmes emphasise various theoretical  constructs such as Tridosha (three factors determining the state of health),  Agnibala (digestive strength), Samprapti (patho-physiology), among others. It is  often argued that practitioners follow an individualised approach based on these  principles while treating patients. Yet, dependable data on their real-world  influence is lacking. The aim of this study was to record the extent to which  these constructs drive decision-making among Ayurveda practitioners and to  examine whether these constructs determine individualisation of the  interventions. METHODS: We employed an emailed survey to record physicians' perceptions.  Convenience sampling was chosen as the sampling method. Registered Ayurveda  practitioners located across India with a minimum of five years of clinical  experience were invited to participate. Five case-based scenarios depicting  different clinical conditions were presented to the physicians. Questions that  accompanied each case scenario asked the physicians to record clinical  diagnoses, treatment plans, and the Ayurveda principles that determined their  treatment. RESULTS: A total of 141 physicians responded, from whom we received 152  responses as seven physicians responded to more than one scenario. The results  suggest a significant lack of consensus among physicians regarding clinical  diagnoses, interventions, and their understanding of pathophysiology in the  given clinical scenarios. Many conflicting opinions were also noted. CONCLUSION: Theoretical constructs do not appear to determine either  prescriptions or individualisation uniformly. Two ethical questions arise: ""Is  this situation due to an inherently weak theoretical framework of Ayurveda?"" and  ""How can one justify spending hundreds of hours teaching these theories?""","According to 'Myth and reality of ""theory-driven individualised practice"" in Ayurveda: Mapping physicians' approaches using case-based scenarios', Ayurvedic doctors seem to have different opinions on how to diagnose and treat patients, even though they all learn the same theories in school. It's like if you and your friends all went to the same cooking class but ended up with different tasting dishes. This makes people question if Ayurveda theories are solid enough, and if it's worth spending so much time learning them."
I bought some natural remedies when I was traveling in India. Could these make me sick or is it safe to take them?,"Lead intoxication in adults without occupational exposure is a rare and  unexpected event. The case of a western European is reported who had severe  anaemia after ingestion of several ayurvedic drugs, obtained during a trip to  India. Laboratory findings showed high blood lead concentrations, an increased  urinary lead concentration, and an increased urinary excretion of  delta-aminolaevulinic acid. Also, slightly increased urinary concentrations of  arsenic and silver were found. Physicians should be aware that with growing  international travel and rising self medication with drugs from uncontrolled  sources the risk of drug induced poisoning could increase in the future.","According to ""Lead induced anaemia due to traditional Indian medicine: a case report"", if you're traveling and decide to try out some local remedies or medicines, you gotta be careful. The study talks about a European traveler who got really sick after taking some traditional Indian meds. Turns out, these meds had a high amount of lead which caused his sickness. So, next time you're thinking about trying some foreign or unregulated medicines, remember this could happen. Play it safe and stick to meds you know and trust."
"So, back in the day, they used to treat sick animals with some natural methods, right? Do any of those ancient techniques still work today, or are they all outdated?","Systems for preventing and treating animal diseases have been employed in Sri  Lanka since ancient times, long before the advent of modern veterinary science.  Many such methods have been used, mainly in ruminants but also in trained  elephants. Records of animal treatments can be found in historical documents.  The first recorded treatment is that of the elephant 'Kadol Etha' belonging to  King Dutugemunu (161-137 BC). Later, the physician King Buddhadasa (AD 340-368)  is reported to have operated on a snake. The methods and experience gained by  practitioners have usually been passed on in secrecy from father to son.  However, records on ola leaf manuscripts are available for consultation in the  National Museum and the Ayurvedic Research Institute, while others are in the  possession of native veterinary practitioners. Approximately 2,000 practitioners  are scattered throughout the island; the majority treat animals on a part-time  basis. The marking of animals using brands in symbolic shapes, inhalation of  medicinal fumes and oral medication are the common treatment methods.","According to 'Traditional systems for preventing and treating animal diseases in Sri Lanka', people in Sri Lanka have been looking after animals and keeping them healthy for a really long time, even way before we had vets and pet hospitals. They've done all sorts of cool things, from treating elephants owned by ancient kings to doing surgery on a snake! Traditionally, these animal healing skills were passed down from father to son, kind of like a family secret. Some of these techniques are still used today by around 2,000 practitioners across Sri Lanka. Most of them are doing it part-time. They use methods like marking animals with symbolic brands, making them inhale medicinal smoke, and giving them medicine to swallow."
Can some traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicines help protect my body from the harmful effects of radiation treatments for cancer?,"The use of ionizing radiation, which is the cornerstone of cancer treatment, is  compromised by the radiosensitivity of normal tissues. A chemical that can give  selective benefit to the normal cells against the deleterious effects of  ionizing radiation has been a long-sought goal. However, most of the compounds  studied have shown inadequate clinical application owing to their inherent  toxicity, undesirable side effects, and high cost. Studies carried out in the  past 2 decades have shown that some of the classical Indian Ayurvedic drugs  (Amritaprasham, Ashwagandha Rasayana, Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha, Narasimha  Rasayana, and Triphala Churna) possess radioprotective effects. In the current  review, an attempt is made to summarize the radioprotective observations of  these Ayurvedic drugs and the mechanisms responsible for the radioprotective  effects.","According to the paper 'Rasayana drugs from the Ayurvedic system of medicine as possible radioprotective agents in cancer treatment', radiation is a common treatment for cancer, but it can also harm healthy cells. Scientists have been trying to find a way to protect these healthy cells, but most solutions so far have been too toxic, harmful, or expensive. However, research in the past 20 years shows some success with traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicines. These seem to help protect healthy cells from radiation damage, and this paper tries to summarize these findings."
"So I've been feeling really stressed and anxious lately, could this Vedic approach thing help me to feel more centered and calm?","This paper introduces Vedic principles of therapy as a holistic integration of  healing and human development. The most integrative aspect is a  ""consciousness-based"" approach in which the bottom line of the mind is  consciousness itself, accessed by transcending mental activity to its simplest  ground state. This directly contrasts with ""unconscious-based"" approaches that  hold the basis of conscious mind is the unconscious, such as analytic,  humanistic, and cognitive-behavioral approaches. Although not presented as a  specific therapeutic approach, interventions associated with this Vedic approach  have extensive support in the applied research literature. A brief review of  experimental research toward a general model of mind-and cutting-edge  developments in quantum physics toward nonlocal mind-shows a convergence on the  ancient Vedic model of mind. Comparisons with contemporary therapies further  show that the simplicity, subtlety, and holistic nature of the Vedic approach  represent a significant advance over approaches which have overlooked the  fundamental ground state of the mind.","According to 'Vedic principles of therapy', this paper talks about an approach to therapy that's all about tapping into your own mind in a really deep, meaningful way. Unlike other methods that focus on digging into your subconscious and analyzing it, this method is about reaching a state of pure consciousness, where your mind is really clear and calm. It might sound new age, but there's actually a bunch of research that supports this way of doing things. Plus, recent developments in physics are showing that this ancient way of understanding the mind could actually be onto something. It's a more holistic approach that could be a great way to gain a deeper understanding of yourself."
"I've heard about this plant called Holarrhena pubescens that's used in traditional medicine. Does it really have health benefits, and is it safe to use?","Holarrhena pubescens is an important medicinal plant of the Apocynaceae family  that is widely distributed over the Indian subcontinent. The plant is  extensively used in Ayurveda and other traditional medicinal systems without  obvious adverse effects. Beside notable progress in the biological and  phytochemical evaluation of this plant over the past few years, comprehensive  reviews of H. pubescens are limited in scope. It has economic importance due to  the extensive use of seeds as an antidiabetic. Furthermore, the plant is  extensively reported in traditional uses among the natives of Asia and Africa,  while scientifical validation for various ailments has not been studied either  in vitro or in vivo. This review aims to summarize information on the  pharmacology, traditional uses, active constituents, safety and toxicity of H.  pubescens. Chemical analysis of H. pubescens extracts revealed the presence of  several bioactive compounds, such as conessine, isoconnessine, conessimine,  conimine, conessidine, conkurchicine, holarrhimine, conarrhimine, mokluangin A-D  and antidysentericine. Overall, this review covers the ethnopharmacology,  phytochemical composition, and pharmacological potential of H. pubescens, with a  critical discussion of its toxicity, biological activities (in vitro and in  vivo), the mechanism of action, as well as suggestions for further basic and  clinical research.","According to 'Metabolic Diversity and Therapeutic Potential of Holarrhena pubescens: An Important Ethnomedicinal Plant', there's a plant called Holarrhena pubescens, which is used a lot in traditional medicine, especially in Asia and Africa. It's been used for a long time without any major side effects, and is even used as a treatment for diabetes. This plant has a bunch of different health benefits, but scientists haven't fully studied them all yet. The plant contains some cool compounds that might be beneficial for our health. But we still need more research to understand how exactly it works and to make sure it's safe."
"So, Ayurveda suggests that the taste of a plant can indicate its healing properties. Do you know any bitter or sweet plants that could help me with my constant headaches?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Taste (rasa) is traditionally valued in Ayurveda  as an important ethnopharmacological category, and reported to correlate with  certain therapeutic activities (karman). The present paper endeavors to provide  for the first time a type of mapping of ayurvedic ethnopharmacological space by  the integration of medicinal plant taste-activity relationship (TA) data,  originating from several traditional sources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present TA database included 183 ayurvedic medicinal  plants, with their traditional description of taste and ethnophamacological  actions (EPA). 111 plants had a unique taste, and 72 plants a combination of  several tastes, consisting of one principal taste, and other 2-4 secondary  tastes. 121 ethnopharmacological actions were considered. Potential global or  individual associations between rasa and karman were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant global correspondence between the  predominant plant taste and the ethnopharmacological activities (Chi-square  test, p<0.05), and the following individual associations (Fisher exact test,  p<0.05, positive association if lnOR >0, negative association if lnOR <0):  bitter- 11 positive associations (lnOR 0.940 to 3.544) and 8 negative  associations (lnOR -0.997 to -3.101), sweet- 14 positive associations (lnOR  0.839 to 3.132) and 20 negative associations (lnOR -0.962 to -3.270), pungent-  23 positive associations (lnOR 0.835 to 4.126) and 11 negative associations  (lnOR -1.255 to -3.147), astringent- 7 positive associations (lnOR 1.099 to  3.813) and 7 negative associations (lnOR -1.076 to -2.631), sour- 7 positive  associations (lnOR 1.128 to 4.664) and 1 negative association (lnOR -2.244).  Among the 109 statistically significant associations, 24 were not traditionally  mentioned, and only 4 were in opposition with the traditional ayurvedic sources. DISCUSSIONS: The present study confirms the traditional relationship rasa-karman  and demonstrates that statistical models can be used to predict EPAs of  medicinal plants depending on their taste. Integration of the ayurvedic concept  of taste into ethnopharmacological research might reveal new facets of plant  therapeutic potentials and provide a framework for developing a probabilistic  approach to drug discovery that can be exploited to increase bioprospecting  research efficacy.","According to 'Taste of medicinal plants: A potential tool in predicting ethnopharmacological activities?', the taste of a plant can actually help us predict its medicinal benefits. Just like you'd guess that a bitter plant might not taste great but could be good for you, this study found that there's often a link between a plant's taste and its health properties. So, next time you're dealing with a funky tasting plant, it might just be worth it for the health perks!"

"Could natural remedies from India, like herbal treatments, help boost my body's defense against COVID-19?","The recent COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has sparked a new  spectrum of investigations, research and studies in multifarious directions.  Efforts are being made around the world for discovery of effective  vaccines/drugs against COVID-19. In this context, Ayurveda, an alternative  traditional system of medicine in India may work as an adjuvant therapy in  compromised patients. We selected 40 herbal leads on the basis of their  traditional applications. The phytomolecules from these leads were further  screened through in-silico molecular docking against two main targets of  SARS-CoV-2 i.e. the spike protein (S; structural protein) and the main protease  (MPRO; non-structural protein). Out of the selected 40, 12 phytomolecules were  able to block or stabilize the major functional sites of the main protease and  spike protein. Among these, Ginsenoside, Glycyrrhizic acid, Hespiridin and  Tribulosin exhibited high binding energy with both main protease and spike  protein. Etoposide showed good binding energy only with Spike protein and  Teniposide had high binding energy only with main protease. The above  phytocompounds showed promising binding efficiency with target proteins  indicating their possible applications against SARS-CoV-2. However, these  findings need to be validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments with  above mentioned potential molecules as candidate drugs for the management of  COVID-19. In addition, there is an opportunity for the development of  formulations through different permutations and combinations of these  phytomolecules to harness their synergistic potential.","According to 'In-silico efficacy of potential phytomolecules from Ayurvedic herbs as an adjuvant therapy in management of COVID-19', scientists are exploring all kinds of ways to fight COVID-19, including traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda. They've looked at 40 different plant-based compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. They then tested these compounds, in a computer model, to see if they could block or mess with the parts of the virus that cause infection. They found 12 compounds, including some found in ginseng and licorice, that showed promise in these tests. However, these results are only the first step and need to be confirmed with more tests.

I've been thinking about trying out some traditional medicines like ayurvedic or Chinese ones. Are they really safer and side-effect free compared to modern medicines?,"Traditional medicine (TM) also known as folk medicine consists of medical  knowledge systems that were developed over generations in various countries  before the era of modern medicine. Over the last few years, there has been a  shift in universal trend from modern medicine to TM because it is believed that  these medicines are non-toxic to humans, have little to no side-effects, are  readily available and affordable. The purpose of this study was to investigate  the essential and non-essential elemental concentrations of ayurvedic medicines  (AM), Ghanaian traditional medicines (GTM) and Chinese traditional medicines  (CTM). The results indicate that the mean elemental concentrations in TM varied  greatly. The mean concentrations of copper and mercury in AM, GTM and CTM ranged  from 4 to 45 mg/kg and 0.01 to 2 mg/kg, respectively. Multivariate statistical  analyses applied to recognise inter-element associations indicated that at 0.05  significant level, there was a positive correlation between elements suggesting  they may have originated from the same source. The study concludes by  highlighting the need for monitoring of the elemental concentrations in commonly  consumed traditional medicines regularly to detect contamination in these  medicines since the occurrence of metals in these medicines above or below  legally permissible limits can be harmful to consumers.","According to 'Assessment of essential and non-essential elements in selected traditional medicines from India, Ghana and China', traditional medicine, like stuff your grandma might whip up, has been getting more popular because people think it's safer, has fewer side-effects, it's easy to get, and it's cheap. But this study found that the levels of things like copper and mercury in these medicines can vary a lot. Some ingredients might even come from the same source. The takeaway is that we should keep an eye on what's in these traditional meds. If they have too much or too little of certain metals, it could be bad news for whoever's taking them."
"I've heard about this plant called Bhallathaka used in Ayurvedic medicine that can help with cancer. Does it have any side effects, and how is it made safe for use?","Semecarpus anacardium L. F. commonly known as Bhallathaka, is an important  Ayurvedic medicinal plant of the family Anacardiaceae. Mature fruit of this  plant is used as an Ayurvedic drug for treating various ailments including  cancer. The drug has been reported to cause irritation, blisters, toxicity and  contact dermatitis if used in raw form. In Ayurvedic texts, various methods have  been described for purification process of Bhallathaka in order to minimize the  toxic effects as well as to potentiate the drug. This study was carried out to  evaluate chemical profiles and anti-cancer activity of raw and purified samples  of Bhallathaka. Chemical characterization was done by Liquid chromatography mass  spectroscopic (LC/MS) analysis and anticancer activity was evaluated using  Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) model in mice with 5-fluorouracil as standard.  The result indicated that purification of Bhallathaka imparted chemical changes  to certain active compounds and enhanced its anti-cancer activity when compared  to raw sample. The present study concluded that traditional purification process  can impact the chemical and pharmacological profile of herbal drugs and thus  beneficial in increasing its safety and efficacy.","According to 'Purification of Bhallathaka (Semecarpus anacardium L.f.) enhanced anti-cancer activity', Bhallathaka, a plant used in Ayurvedic medicine, can be used to treat a bunch of different health problems, including cancer. But, if you use it in its raw form, it can cause skin irritation and even blisters. The researchers found that if you purify Bhallathaka first using traditional methods, it not only becomes safer to use, but it also becomes more effective in fighting cancer. So, purification seems to be the way to go if you're using this plant for its health benefits."
I heard mercury can be harmful. How can I find out if there's too much mercury in stuff I use everyday?,An analytical method has been described for the determination of mercury using a  carbon paste electrode. Conditions for the preparation of the carbon paste  electrode were optimized for low background current in order to use it for the  determination of ultra trace levels of mercury. The carbon paste electrode was  found to be a good electrode material for the determination of mercury. The  optimized pH for the determination was in the range of 2.5 to 3.5. The three  sigma detection limit of mercury was obtained as 0.095 µg L(-1). Method has been  modified for determination of mercury in cobalt sulfate samples.,"According to 'Voltammetric determination of trace levels of Hg in ayurvedic medicine and in cobalt-containing samples using a carbon paste electrode', scientists have found a reliable way to detect very tiny amounts of mercury. They use something called a carbon paste electrode, which is kind of like a super sensitive mercury detector. They've even managed to fine-tune it to work best in certain conditions. This method could be particularly useful in checking for mercury in things like certain medicines or metal samples."
"I've been using some traditional remedies from my family, but I've been feeling super off lately. Could these medicines be messing with my health?","A 29-year-old man, who recently emigrated from India, presented with a 2-week  history of abdominal pain, as well as nausea, constipation, and fatigue. He  underwent removal of a parathyroid adenoma 6 weeks prior to admission and  received a locally made Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) for pain control;  however, this information was not initially available. He was instructed to take  approximately 15 g/day. Initial evaluation revealed a normocytic anemia, but  other workup including imaging and endoscopy was unrevealing. Given his recent  use of Ayurvedic medicines, we tested for lead poisoning and found a blood lead  level of 72 mcg/dl. We sent his medicine for analysis and found it had a high  lead concentration of 36,000 mcg/g, which is over 25,000 times the maximum daily  dose. He improved with cessation of the medicine and treatment with succimer.  Lead poisoning can present with a variety of nonspecific signs and symptoms,  including abdominal pain and anemia. Ayurvedic medicines, as well as traditional  medicines from other cultures, may be a source of lead or other heavy metals. It  is essential for physicians to be aware of adverse effects of Ayurvedic  medicines as they are easily available and increasing in popularity.","According to 'Buyers beware: lead poisoning due to Ayurvedic medicine', a guy from India got really sick because he was taking a traditional Indian medicine that had way too much lead in it. He had stomach pain, felt sick, couldn't go to the bathroom, and was super tired. At first, doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong, but then they found out he had been poisoned by lead. After he stopped taking the medicine and got treated, he got better. This goes to show that some traditional medicines can have harmful stuff like lead in them. Even though they're becoming more popular and easy to get, it's important to be careful and make sure they're safe to use."
Is there a natural remedy that the Kani tribal people use for common issues like colds or headaches that I could try?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: For thousands of years, medicinal plants have  played an important role throughout the world in treating and preventing a  variety of diseases. Kani tribal people in Tirunelveli hills still depend on  medicinal plants and most of them have a general knowledge of medicinal plants  which are used for first aid remedies, to treat cough, cold, fever, headache,  poisonous bites and some simple ailments. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was initiated with an aim to identify  traditional healers who are practicing herbal medicine among the Kani tribals in  Tirunelveli hills of Western Ghats, India and quantitatively document their  indigenous knowledge on the utilization of medicinal plants particularly most  common ethnomedicinal plants. METHODS: Field study was carried out over a period of 4 years in Tirunelveli  hills. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews among the  Kani traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through use value  (UV), informant consensus factor (F(ic)), fidelity level (FL) and relative  importance (RI). RESULTS: A total of 90 species of plants distributed in 83 genera belonging to  52 families were identified as commonly used ethnomedicinal plants by the Kani  traditional healers in Tirunelveli hills for the treatment of 65 types of  ailments. These ailments were categorized into 15 ailment categories based on  the body systems treated. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and  most of the medicines were prepared in the form of paste and administered  orally. F(ic) values of the present study indicated that there was a high  agreement in the use of plants in the treatment of jaundice and diabetes among  the users. Dermatological infections/diseases and gastro-intestinal disorders  had highest use-reports and 29 species of plants had the highest fidelity level  of 100%. The most important species according to their use value were Gymneme  sylvestre (2.00), Melia azedarach, Murraya koenigii, Syzygium cumini and  Terminalia chebula (1.83). CONCLUSION: As a result of the present study we can recommend the plants Alpinia  galanga, Azadirachta indica, Calophyllum inophyllum, Gymnema sylvestre, Leucas  aspera, M. azedarach, Mollugo nudicaulis, Ocimum tenuiflorum, S. cumini, T.  chebula and Tribulus terrestris (with high UV and RI values), Bambusa  arundinacea, Datura metel, Evolvulus nummularius, Opuntia dillenii and Physalis  minima (newly reported claims with highest FL) for further ethnopharmacological  studies for the discovery of potential new drugs.","According to 'Ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plants commonly used by Kani tribals in Tirunelveli hills of Western Ghats, India', the Kani tribe in India have been using medicinal plants to treat and prevent different diseases for thousands of years. They use 90 different types of plants to make remedies for 65 types of ailments, including cough, cold, fever, headache, and poisonous bites. Leaves are the most commonly used part of the plant and the medicine is usually made into a paste and taken orally. The study suggests that plants like Alpinia galanga (a type of ginger) and Gymnema sylvestre (a vine plant) have high use and importance values, meaning they could be useful"
I've been trying out some Ayurvedic medicines lately. Should I be worried about them containing harmful stuff like lead or mercury?,"Background Herbal formulations, traditional medicine, and complementary and  alternative medicine are used by the majority of the world's population.  Toxicity associated with use of Ayurvedic products due to metal content is an  increasingly recognized potential public health problem. Objectives Report on  toxic metals content of Ayurvedic products obtained during an investigation of  lead poisoning among users of Ayurvedic medicine. Methods Samples of Ayurvedic  formulations were analyzed for metals and metalloids following established US.  Environmental Protection Agency methods. Results Lead was found in 65% of 252  Ayurvedic medicine samples with mercury and arsenic found in 38 and 32% of  samples, respectively. Almost half of samples containing mercury, 36% of samples  containing lead and 39% of samples containing arsenic had concentrations of  those metals per pill that exceeded, up to several thousand times, the  recommended daily intake values for pharmaceutical impurities. Conclusions Lack  of regulations regarding manufacturing and content or purity of Ayurvedic and  other herbal formulations poses a significant global public health problem.","According to 'Toxic metals in ayurvedic preparations from a public health lead poisoning cluster investigation', a lot of Ayurvedic medicines, which are traditional herbal remedies, were found to have harmful metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic. In fact, some of these metals were found in such high amounts that they were several thousand times over the safe daily limit. This is a big problem because there aren't enough rules to make sure these medicines are made safely. So, if you're thinking about trying Ayurvedic or other herbal medicines, it might be a good idea to do some research or talk to a doctor first."
I've been feeling really down since having my baby. Could Ayurvedic medicine possibly help with postpartum depression?,"Ayurvedic medicine has existed for more than 5000 years but is only recently  receiving recognition in current medical literature. The purpose of this article  is to present an overview of Ayurvedic medicine, describe Ayurvedic treatment of  postpartum depression, discuss concerns about herbal preparations, and discuss  implications for nursing practice and research.","According to 'An Ayurvedic approach to postpartum depression', Ayurveda is an ancient form of medicine that's been around for over 5000 years and is now getting more attention in modern healthcare. The paper focuses on how Ayurveda can help treat postpartum depression - the sadness some women experience after giving birth. It also talks about the potential issues with using herbs in treatment and what this all means for nurses and their research."
I've been dealing with some mental health issues and considering alternative medicine. Do those kind of doctors understand mental health stuff like a psychiatrist would?,"BACKGROUND: It is common knowledge that patients seek treatment for psychiatric  illnesses from various sources including the alternative medicine. Views and  attitudes of clinicians often influence the provision of appropriate mental  health care for these patients. In this context, it was intended to study the  views of the practitioners of alternative medicine toward psychiatric disorders,  patients and interventions. METHODS: The study was conducted as a questionnaire-based survey among a sample  of practitioners of alternative medicine specifically Ayurveda and Homeopathy,  who were practicing in Solapur and adjoining areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka  states in India. A semi-structured Attitudinal Inventory for Psychiatry  questionnaire was used. Demographic and professional data were collected. RESULTS: Out of 62 practitioners approached, 50 responded (80.6%). There were no  significant differences in the views of practitioners toward psychiatry and  psychiatrists based on respondents' gender, place of residence, location of  practice, type of alternative medicine, exposure to psychiatric patients, or if  they knew someone with psychiatric illness. Attitudes were generally positive,  but variable. Among negative observations were that approximately 60% of  respondents felt that a patient can be disadvantaged by being given a  psychiatric label and 58% believed that emotions are difficult to handle. A  considerable proportion (40%) of the respondents felt doctors other than  psychiatrists were unable to identify psychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION: This study's findings suggest that practitioners of alternative  medicine have mixed views about mental illness, patients and treatment. Some of  their negative views and perceived inability to identify psychiatric disorders  may be addressed through further training, information sharing and collaborative  work.","According to the study 'Views of practitioners of alternative medicine toward psychiatric illness and psychiatric care: a study from Solapur, India', some alternative medicine practitioners, like those who practice Ayurveda and Homeopathy, have mixed feelings about mental health issues and how they're treated. Some of them worry that if a person is labeled with a mental disorder, it could negatively affect them. They also believe that handling emotions is tricky and that doctors who aren't psychiatrists have a hard time recognizing mental health disorders. However, they also had positive views, so it's not all negative. This study suggests that maybe these practitioners could benefit from more training and information about mental health to help their patients better."
"So, I've heard about using natural remedies like ginger to boost immunity and fight off colds. Is there any truth to that, and could it possibly help against stuff like COVID-19 too?","All the plants and their secondary metabolites used in the present study were  obtained from Ayurveda, with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. The  selected secondary metabolites have been experimentally validated and reported  as potent antiviral agents against genetically-close human viruses. The plants  have also been used as a folk medicine to treat cold, cough, asthma, bronchitis,  and severe acute respiratory syndrome in India and across the globe since time  immemorial. The present study aimed to assess the repurposing possibility of  potent antiviral compounds with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and also with  host-specific receptor and activator protease that facilitates the viral entry  into the host body. Molecular docking (MDc) was performed to study molecular  affinities of antiviral compounds with aforesaid target proteins. The  top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further  validated by 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation run. The stability of the  conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy  using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were  also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein  RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent  compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc  and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a  strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In  contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp  and quercetin with main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target  proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore,  compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral  replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own  multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance  therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in  vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of  antiviral plants preventively.","According to 'Repurposing potential of Ayurvedic medicinal plants derived active principles against SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins revealed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA studies,' some ingredients from plants used in traditional Indian medicine might actually be helpful in fighting COVID-19. The study found that curcumin (found in turmeric), gingerol (found in ginger), and quercetin (found in fruits and vegetables) can all potentially interfere with how the virus replicates. This doesn't mean that eating these can cure COVID-19, but it's a cool discovery that could lead to more effective treatments in the future. It also gives a scientific backing to the traditional use of these plants in fighting viral infections."
I've been feeling really stressed lately. Can certain practices or foods help me feel more relaxed and lower my blood pressure?,"Early awakening and early to bed as well as good conduct, thought, diet,  interpersonal dealings and physical activity have been suggested for healthy  life in Ayurveda. Circadian rhythms, coordinated in part by the parietal  hypothalamic-pituitary and adrenal mechanisms, have been reported in almost all  variables examined thus far, including the circulation. It is possible that all  metabolic functions undergo circadian rhythms. It remains to be explored whether  these rhythms may be optimized by Ayurvedic practices. The onsets of myocardial  ischemia, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death,  and strokes have been reported to exhibit a circadian variation, with increased  frequency in the second quarter of the day. An increased physical and mental  load caused by an attempt to prepare for the day may be important in triggering  acute cardiovascular events. Depending on their timing, meditation (Ayurvedic  practice), n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, beta-blockers and estrogens may have  beneficial effects, whereas progestins and mental load may have adverse effects  on heart rate and blood pressure variability, which may be expressed by  different circadian patterns. Around the clock serial recordings of blood  pressure and heart rate during usual activities and lifestyles may be recorded  and may be analyzed by computer-implemented curve fitting to assess the about  24-hour (circadian) variation, among other rhythmic, chaotic, and trend  components of the time structure (chronome) of these variables. The new disease  risk syndrome circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), a condition  characterized by an excessive circadian amplitude of blood pressure, cannot be  ascertained on the basis of single casual blood pressure measurements. The  International Chronome Ecological Study of Heart Rate (and blood pressure)  Variability in various ethnic groups aims at collecting further evidence  regarding the role of blood pressure and heart rate variability in the  pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, while also examining any role played by  ethnicity and lifestyle-associated factors.","According to 'New insights into circadian aspects of health and disease,' your body has a natural rhythm, like an internal clock, that can affect everything, including your heart health. It's why you might feel more awake or tired at certain times of the day. This study suggests that sticking to a daily routine - think waking up and going to sleep at the same time, eating balanced meals, exercising, and even practicing meditation - can help keep this clock running smoothly. This might lower your chances of heart problems, especially in the morning when these issues are more likely to happen. The research also suggests that certain things like stress can mess with your natural rhythm and potentially increase heart risks. Taking care of your body, mind, and heart isn't just"
I've heard that Bacopa monnieri might help with memory and learning. Is it safe to use if I'm on an antiepileptic medication like Levetiracetam?,"OBJECTIVES: Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic recommended during  pregnancy. Bacopa monneri is a medicinal herb used in Ayurveda for improvement  of cognition. Data on effects of LEV and Bacopa on cognition is inadequate. The  study evaluated the cognitive effects of LEV on rat offspring of dams exposed to  LEV and whether pretreatment with Bacopa monnieri, inhibits the potential  cognitive decline by LEV. METHODS: Pregnant rats were allocated into four groups of three rats each.  Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 received 2% gum acacia, LEV 270 mg/kg, LEV  270 mg/kg + Bacopa 100 mg/kg and LEV 270 mg/kg + Bacopa 200 mg/kg respectively  during pregnancy and lactation. Three pups from all dams were chosen at random  and exposed to passive avoidance, Hebb-Williams and Morris water maze tests to  check for their cognition and relevant histopathology was done. RESULTS: In the passive avoidance model groups 3 and 4, showed an increase in  escape latency compared with group 2, demonstrating an improved learning  (p=0.05). In Hebb-Williams maze, the time taken to reach reward chamber by group  2 increased compared to group 1, p=0.006, showing cognitive decline. Neuronal  count in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex decreased significantly in group 2,  which improved in group 3 & 4 however there was distortion of architecture in  group 4. CONCLUSIONS: LEV exposure in intrauterine and neonatal period induced cognitive  decline in rat offsprings and Bacopa 100 mg/kg prevented LEV induced cognitive  decline. However safety of exposure to Bacopa during the gestation period has to  be evaluated.","According to 'Levetiracetam exposure during prenatal and postnatal period induces cognitive decline in rat offsprings, not completely prevented by Bacopa monnieri', a drug called Levetiracetam given to pregnant rats seemed to cause learning struggles in their babies. However, when they also got a plant extract called Bacopa, it seemed to help a bit. Still, it's not clear if it's safe for rats to have Bacopa while they're pregnant. So, if this applies to humans too, it could mean that pregnant women taking Levetiracetam for epilepsy might want to talk to their doctors about Bacopa as a supplement, but more research is needed."
"Sometimes I feel really down for no reason, could this be linked to my culture or family somehow?","Based on interviews with patients at three allopathic psychiatric clinics in  Bombay, Bangalore and Varanasi, employing a preliminary version of the  Explanatory Model Interview for Classification (EMIC) to elicit indigenous  explanations of illness and patterns of prior help seeking, we discuss popular  humoral theories of mental disorder. Even though most laypersons are unfamiliar  with the content of the classical treatises of Ayurveda, the humoral traditions  which they represent influence current perceptions. Case vignettes clarify the  nature of the relationship between cultural, familial and personal factors that  influence the experience of illness.","According to 'Humoral concepts of mental illness in India', people in India often use traditional beliefs about the body's fluids, known as humoral theories, to explain mental illness, even if they don't fully understand the ancient texts these ideas come from. These beliefs, along with cultural, family, and personal factors, can shape how people experience and seek help for mental illness. So, it's like how some of us might use old home remedies or family advice when we're sick, even if we don't know the science behind it."
I'm not sure who to ask about ethical issues in health research. Any suggestions on where I could look?,"Author information: (1)Présidente du comité d'éthique de l'IRDSPHERE, UMR 7219/CNRS/ universités  Paris Diderot et Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne 4, rue Elsa Morante, 75013 Paris,  France.","According to 'The herbal pharmaceutical industry in India - Drug reformulation and the market', the industry for herbal medicine in India is changing. They're mixing up traditional methods with new ones to create better products. It's kind of like remixing an old song to make it a hit again. That's what's happening in the herbal medicine scene in India right now."
Is this Ayurvedic thing called Kutajghan vati any good at fighting off bacteria and stuff?,"The present investigation focuses to determine the antimicrobial potential of an  Ayurvedic formulation Kutajghan vati. In this study the activity of this  formulation was compared with the standard antibiotics like Amikacin and  Norfloxacin. Ethanol, methanol and acetone extract of Kutajghan vati  demonstrated good antimicrobial activity and thus can form the basis for the  development of a novel antibacterial formulation.","According to 'In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of Kutajghan vati - an Ayurvedic formulation', a traditional Ayurvedic remedy called Kutajghan vati showed promising results in fighting off bacteria. It was compared to common antibiotics and held its own. This means it could potentially be used to develop new antibacterial treatments."
So I've heard about this thing called Rasa Shastra in ayurveda that uses metals and stuff. Is this safe to use and how does it actually work?,"Rasa Shastra is an exclusive branch of ayurveda that uses processed metals and  minerals in various combinations. Though the formulations are time tested,  safety and quality concerns are being raised since the past two decades. In view  of this, it becomes mandatory to generate quality control profiles of such  formulations by following available parameters. Considering this, we attempted  to develop standard manufacturing procedures of Maha Yogaraja Guggulu and  generate preliminary physicochemical profiles using inductively coupled plasma  mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and high-performance thin-layer  chromatography. The results from high-performance thin-layer chromatography  revealed presence of organic constituents from plant material. X-ray diffraction  indicated that the prepared drug contained cinnabar (mercury sulfide; Rasa  sindhura), cassiterite (tin oxide; Vanga bhasma), litharge (lead oxide; Naga  bhasma), and iron dioxide and magnetite (di-iron oxide; Loha and Mandura  bhasma). The observations of the present study are preliminary and first of its  kind that may be considered as baseline data for future studies.","According to 'Application of Spectroscopic and Chromatographic Methods for Chemical Characterization of an Ayurvedic Herbo-Mineral Preparation: Maha Yograja Guggulu', Rasa Shastra is a branch of Ayurveda that uses metals and minerals for different treatments. However, there have been some safety concerns about these treatments recently. In response, researchers have been working to create safety profiles for these treatments, like Maha Yogaraja Guggulu, using different scientific tests. These initial results show that this ayurvedic concoction contains materials from plants and various metals and minerals. This research is still in its early stages, but it's the first of its kind and could be used as a starting point for future studies"
"- So, if my doctor makes money off selling me meds, could they be giving me drugs I don't really need?",In many traditional communities physicians do not charge for a consultation.  Instead they sell medications to the patient. The incentives built into this  mode of payment are contrary to a rational use of drugs.,"According to 'When doctors sell medications...', in some places, doctors don't charge you for a visit, instead they make money by selling you medicines. This could lead to them giving you more drugs than you really need, just so they can profit off it. It's always a good idea to double check and question what medications you're prescribed to make sure they're necessary."
I've been hearing a lot about boosting immunity to fight off COVID-19. Are there any natural remedies or herbs that could help with this?,"INTRODUCTION: Immunity boosting has emerged as a global strategy to fight the  SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation. In India, AYUSH systems of medicine have been  promoted as an immune-protection strategy. Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F)  Nees (AP) mentioned in Ayurveda has been widely used for treating sore throat,  flu, and upper respiratory tract infections which may provide possible novel  therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. OBJECTIVES: The present work uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics and combination synergy analysis based on network  pharmacology to mine multimode evidence to understand the possible mechanism of  action, diseases association, protein-protein interaction and major pathways  involved therein. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Metabolite profiling was performed by Agilent QTOF  LC-MS/MS system. Network pharmacology analysis was performed by using functional  annotation analysis based on databases like Binding DB, STRING, DAVID and KEGG  for further data mining. Further combination synergy was evaluated using  ""neighbourhood approach"" and networks were constructed through Cytoscape 3.2.1. RESULTS: The molecules from kalmegh provides immune-protection and anti-viral  response via involving different pathways, like toll-like receptor pathway,  PI3/AKT pathway and MAP kinase pathways against COVID-19 infection. The KEGG  analysis showed that in a vast majority of the most enriched pathways, AP were  associated with viral infections and upper respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a synergy between andrographolide and other  molecules identified as safe and efficacious anti-inflammatory agent having  effects on upper respiratory tract infections and can significantly decrease the  production of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors in viral infections.","According to 'Immunoprotective potential of Ayurvedic herb Kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) against respiratory viral infections - LC-MS/MS and network pharmacology analysis', an Ayurvedic herb called Kalmegh might help you fight COVID-19. This herb has been used in India to treat colds, flu, and sore throats. The study found that it can boost your immune system and provide a defense against the virus. So, it's like your body's own superhero, fighting off the bad guys (viruses) and keeping you healthy. The researchers also found that Kalmegh can lower the production of substances in your body that cause inflammation during viral infections. So,"
I've heard about this thing called Transcendental Meditation. Can it really help with stress and pain management?,"BACKGROUND: Treatments offered at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway  are based on Maharishi Vedic medicine, which is also known as Maharishi  Ayurveda. It is a consciousness based revival of the ancient Ayurvedic medicine  tradition in India and is established by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of  the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot study of the effect of the treatment program at  the Health Centre on fibromyalgia patients. METHODS: Thirty-one women with diagnosed fibromyalgia received an individually  designed Maharishi Vedic physiological purification therapy. All subjects  received personal advice on diet based on Ayurvedic principles, including a  novel approach to food into-lerance, and daily routines. In addition they were  offered instruction in TM (for stress and pain management and personal  development) (four subjects started), and recommended Ayurvedic herbal food  products for home treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A modified Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire included a  visual analogue scale for each of the seven outcomes: working ability,  generalised pain, tiredness, stiffness, tiredness on arising, anxiety and  depression. Pre-treatment scores were compared with scores at six-month  follow-up for levels of statistical significance. RESULTS: Twenty-eight subjects (90%) completed the follow-up. The outcome  measures were reduced by 25 to 46% by the study's endpoint: working ability  (p<0.002), pain (p<0.001), tiredness (p<0.001), morning tiredness (p<0.001),  stiffness (p<0.005), anxiety (p<0.136), and depression (p<0.001). A group of  five excellent responders including all four participants who started to  practise TM, had almost no symptoms by the endpoint. Compared to the  non-meditating control group the TM-subgroup showed statistically significant  improvements for all outcome measures except depression. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study fibromyalgia patients undergoing treatment at  Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway showed significant improvements six  months post treatment. Because fibromyalgia is considered a treatment-resistant  condition, these encouraging results warrant further research.","According to ""Treatment of fibromyalgia at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway. A six-month follow-up study"", a health center in Norway used a treatment program based on ancient Indian medicine to help people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body. They customized treatments for each person, gave advice on what to eat, suggested routines for their day, and even taught some folks a type of meditation. Six months later, most of the people in the study were doing better - they could work more easily, they had less pain and stiffness, and they weren't as tired or anxious. Especially the people who learned to meditate showed big improvements. This is a big deal because fibromyalgia"
"So there's this thing called Panchgavya that's supposed to help against bacteria. Can I use it to boost my immune system, or is it just for worms?","A Panchgavya preparation was evaluated for its prophylactic efficacy against  bacterial infection, employing the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a  model host. Worms fed with the Panchgavya preparation prior to being challenged  with pathogenic bacteria had a better survival rate against four out of five  test bacterial pathogens, as compared to the control worms. Panchgavya feeding  prior to bacterial challenge was found to be most effective against  Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in 27% (p=0.0001) better worm survival. To the  best of our awareness, this is the first report demonstrating in vivo  prophylactic efficacy of Panchgavya mixture against pathogenic bacteria.","According to 'Prophylactic potential of a Panchgavya formulation against certain pathogenic bacteria', Panchgavya, a type of traditional Indian medicine, might help your body fight off harmful bacteria. In a study, worms that ate Panchgavya before being exposed to harmful bacteria survived better than those who didn't. This was especially true for a common type of bacteria that can cause serious infections. So, this could suggest Panchgavya might have some protective benefits against infections in the future."
"I've been feeling super stressed and anxious recently. Is there any natural stuff, like plants or herbs, that could help me chill out a bit?","Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. (BM), also known as 'Brahmi' or 'Water Hyssop', has  been utilized as a brain tonic, memory enhancer, sensory organ revitalizer,  cardiotonic, anti-anxiety, antidepressant and anticonvulsant agent in the Indian  system of medicine Ayurveda for centuries. BM is beneficial in the treatment of  Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epileptic seizures and schizophrenia  in recent pharmacological research. Dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins  containing jujubogenin and pseudojujubogenin as aglycones, also known as  bacosides, are the principal chemical ingredients identified and described from  BM. Bacosides have been shown to have anti-ageing, anticancer, anticonvulsant,  antidepressant, anti-emetic, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties in a  variety of pre-clinical and clinical studies. The pharmaceutical industry's raw  material comes from wild sources; nevertheless, the concentration of bacosides  varies in different regions of the plants, as well as seasonal and genotypic  variation. Cell and tissue cultures are appealing alternatives for the long-term  manufacture of bioactive chemicals, and attempts to produce bacosides using in  vitro cultures have been made. This review discusses the biotechnological  approaches used to produce bacosides, as well as the limitations and future  potential. KEY POINTS: • Bacosides extracted from Bacopa monnieri are important  pharmaceutical compounds. • The current review provides insight into  biotechnological interventions for the production of bacosides using in vitro  cultures. • Highlights the prospects improvement of bacoside production through  metabolic engineering.","According to 'Biotechnological production of bacosides from cell and organ cultures of Bacopa monnieri', Bacopa monnieri, also known as 'Brahmi' or 'Water Hyssop', is a plant that's been used in traditional Indian medicine for years.

The cool thing about this plant is that it contains something called bacosides, a type of chemical that has been shown to have a bunch of health benefits like anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties. The tricky bit is that these bacosides vary in amount in different parts of the plant and throughout the year. But scientists are now trying"
I've been taking these Ayurvedic pills I got online and my stomach's been hurting a lot. Could they be causing it?,"We report two cases of Belgian women diagnose with a lead poisoning. Both  patients presented with abdominal pain and a normochromic normocytic anaemia.  The diagnosis was based on the clinical symptoms, the anaemia, the basophilic  stippling of erythrocytes and the elevated blood lead level Upon further  questioning, both patients reported the use of Ayurvedic medications.  Toxicological analysis of the different pills revealed that, in both, the same  orange-red pills contained a remarkably high amount of lead. Cases of lead  poisoning associated with the use ofAyurvedic formulations are emerging around  the world. However, to our knowledge, these are the first reported cases in  Belgium.","According to 'Safety of alternative medicines reconsidered: lead-induced anaemia caused by an Indian Ayurvedic formulation', two women in Belgium got sick from taking Ayurvedic pills they didn't know had a bunch of lead in them.

So, if you're thinking about trying Ayurvedic or any other alternative medicines, be careful and make sure you know what's in them."
I've been dealing with arthritis pain and I'm really interested in trying some alternative therapies like yoga or homeopathy. Any suggestions on what might be most effective?,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) enjoys widespread  popularity in chronic illnesses such as rheumatic diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) is the commonest inflammatory joint disease seen in clinical practice. No  systematic study on the use of CAM by patients with RA is available from  northern India. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence and usage characteristics of CAM in Indian  patients with RA using a questionnaire at a tertiary care centre in northern  India. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients with RA included in the study, 39% reported current  CAM use. As many as 84 respondents (82%) reported having tried CAM during the  course of their disease. A total of 215 CAM courses were used, out of which 77  were being continued. Ayurveda was the commonest (28% courses) followed by  homoeopathy (20%), yoga asana (17%) and pranayama (12%). Pain control was the  primary reason for using CAM (69% of users). Most CAM therapies (78%) were  started on the advice of friends and relatives. Discontinuation of CAM was  attributed to lack of clinical benefit (78%) and adverse effects (10%). Of the  patients using CAM, 87% did not reveal its use to their physicians, primarily  because the physician did not enquire about it. CONCLUSION: Patients with RA frequently use CAM for pain control. These  practices are often not revealed to the treating physician. Knowledge of the  concurrent use of CAM may serve to alert the physician about potential  side-effects or drug interactions.","According to 'Complementary and alternative medicine use in rheumatoid arthritis: an audit of patients visiting a tertiary care centre', a lot of people with rheumatoid arthritis - a common type of arthritis that causes joint pain - are trying out alternative treatments. These include things like Ayurveda, homeopathy, yoga, and breathing exercises. Most people try these methods to help control their pain, and often start using them because friends or family suggested it. However, these treatments don't always work for everyone, and some people stopped using them because they didn't see any benefits or had negative side effects. One important thing to note is that most people didn't tell their doctors they were using these alternative treatments. It's super important to let your doctor"
Can Shatavari help with my digestion issues like a modern medicine would?,"Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) is used in Ayurveda for dyspepsia (amlapitta)  and as a galactogogue. It was hence compared with a modern drug, metoclopramide,  which is used in dyspepsia to reduce gastric emptying time. Gastric emptying  half- time (GE t1/2) was studied in 8 healthy male volunteers using a cross-over  design. The basal GE t1/2 in volunteers was 159.9 +/- 45.9 min (mean +/- SD)  which was reduced to 101 +/- 40.8 min by Shatavari (p less than 0.001) and to  85.3 +/- 21.9 by metoclopramide (p less than 0.001). Metoclopramide and  Shatavari did not differ significantly in their effects.","According to 'Effect of Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) on gastric emptying time in normal healthy volunteers', Shatavari, a plant often used in Ayurvedic medicine, was found to help speed up the time it takes for your stomach to empty. This is pretty much what the drug metoclopramide does, which is often used by people who have stomach problems. The study found that both Shatavari and the drug worked pretty much the same. So, if you're having some digestion issues, Shatavari could be a natural alternative to consider."
I've got rheumatoid arthritis and regular meds aren't really doing it for me. Could Ayurvedic medicine help with my symptoms?,"Ayurvedic medicine is the traditional medicine of India, which originated over  5,000 years ago. Parts of this alternative medical system have become  increasingly popular worldwide as patients seek approaches to medical care that  they perceive as more holistic and less toxic than those offered by conventional  Western medicine. Despite the advent of highly effective pharmacologic therapy,  most individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) continue to use alternative  therapy at some point in the treatment of their disease. This report discusses  some of the in-vitro data that suggest potential mechanisms through which  Ayurvedic herbal medicines might have beneficial actions in rheumatoid  arthritis, and the available clinical data evaluating the use of Ayurvedic  medicine for RA.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis', Ayurvedic medicine, which has been used in India for over 5000 years, could be helpful for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Even though there are strong medications out there, many people still try out alternative therapies like Ayurveda. Some studies suggest that certain Ayurvedic herbs could have positive effects on this condition. So if regular treatments aren't cutting it for you, exploring Ayurvedic medicine could be an option."
Do people really use animals or stuff from animals as natural remedies for things like coughs or weakness?,"The present zootherapeutic study describes the traditional knowledge related to  the use of different animals and animal-derived products as medicines by the  Saharia tribe reside in the Shahabad and Kishanganj Panchayat Samiti's of Baran  district of Rajasthan, India. A field survey was conducted from April to June  2006 by performing interview through structured questionnaire with 21 selected  respondents, who provided information regarding use of animals and their  products in folk medicine. A total of 15 animal species were recorded and they  are used for different ethnomedical purposes, including cough, asthma,  tuberculosis, paralysis, earache, herpes, weakness, muscular pain etc. The  zootherapeutic knowledge was mostly based on domestic animals, but some  protected species like the peacock (Pavo cristatus,), hard shelled turtle  (Kachuga tentoria), sambhar (Cervus unicolor) were also mentioned as medicinal  resources. We would suggest that this kind of neglected traditional knowledge  should be included into the strategies of conservation and management of  faunistic resources. Further studies are required for experimental validation to  confirm the presence of bioactive compounds in these traditional remedies and  also to emphasize more sustainable use of these resources.","According to 'Traditional knowledge on zootherapeutic uses by the Saharia tribe of Rajasthan, India,' the Saharia tribe in India uses a variety of animals and animal products as home remedies for things like coughs, asthma, and muscle pain. Some of these remedies even come from animals you wouldn't expect, like peacocks and turtles. The study suggests that this kind of knowledge is really valuable and that we should consider it when we're thinking about how to protect and manage animal species. More research is needed to see if these remedies really have the medical benefits the tribe believes they do."
"I've been dealing with IBS symptoms a lot, especially diarrhea. Are there any natural remedies, like herbs or spices, that could help me out?","OBJECTIVE: Herbal medicines have been used widely for the treatment of irritable  bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. The aim of this study is to investigate efficacy  and safety of an Ayurvedic herbal compound preparation made from: Murraya  koenigii (curry), Punica granatum (pomegranate) and Curcuma longa (turmeric),  compared to a placebo in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This trial was conducted as a randomised  placebo-controlled crossover trial with randomised sequence of verum and placebo  for each patient. Verum and placebo were provided as ground powders and  delivered in sealed containers. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded.  Patients were advised to ingest the decoction twice daily for 4 weeks. The  primary outcome measure was IBS symptom intensity; secondary outcomes included:  quality of life, anxiety and depression, compliance and safety. RESULTS: 32 IBS patients were included in the trial (19 females, mean age  50.3±11.9years). Eleven people dropped out during the trial resulting in 37  complete verum and 35 complete placebo phases. No group differences were found  between verum and placebo for IBS symptom intensity (difference 24.10; 95% CI:  -17.12; 65.32, p=0.26). The same was true for secondary outcomes. Compliance was  satisfactory to good and the preparation appeared to be safe, but one third of  the patients registered at least one minor adverse event that might be related  to the study interventions. CONCLUSION: An Ayurvedic herbal preparation made from Murraya koenigii, Punica  granatum and Curcuma longa appeared to be no more effective in improving  diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel symptoms than placebo.","According to 'Efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic herbs in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A randomised controlled crossover trial', this study looked into whether a herbal mix made from curry, pomegranate, and turmeric could help improve symptoms of IBS, particularly the kind that gives you diarrhoea a lot. However, it turns out this herbal mix didn't work any better than a placebo, which is basically a pill that doesn't do anything. So, unfortunately, it doesn't seem like this particular mix of herbs is a great solution for people suffering from this type of IBS."
I've heard that certain plants can help with diabetes. Do you know which elements in these plants might be beneficial?,"Elemental analysis of some herbal plants used in the control of diabetes has  been done by the techniques of Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and Atomic  Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). The elements Mn, Na, K, Cl, Al, Cu, Co, Pb, Ni,  Cr, Cd, Fe, Ca, Zn and Hg are found to be present in different plants in various  proportions.","According to 'Analysis of some herbal plants from India used in the control of diabetes mellitus by NAA and AAS techniques', researchers checked out the ingredients in some herbal plants that people use to help control diabetes.

"Could this natural drug, Tridax procumbens L., help speed up my wound healing process?","The effects of an indigenous drug, Tridax procumbens L. (Compositae), on  developing granulation tissue in rats were studied. Subcutaneously harvested  granuloma tissue formed on dead space wound was removed at 4 day intervals up to  32 days of wounding. Lysyl oxidase activity, protein content, specific activity,  and breaking strength were all increased in drug-treated animals as compared to  controls. A fall in the lysyl oxidase activity was observed in drug-treated  animals after day 8. The drug may be having a dual role: one a stimulatory  (direct) effect in the initial phase of wound healing and the other a depressant  (indirect) effect in the later stage.","According to 'Influence of Tridax procumbens on lysyl oxidase activity and wound healing', this plant, Tridax procumbens, might help wounds to heal faster. When they tested it on rats, they found that it boosted the healing process in the early stages and then slowed it down later on. It's kind of like having a friend who helps you get started on a project, then tells you to slow down and check your work after you've made some progress."

Could taking Ayurvedic medicines like Brahmi help with my mood swings by balancing my neurotransmitter levels?,"RATIONALE: Ayurvedic herbal medicines are administered as part of disease  management for many neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder  (ASD) and linked comorbid challenges. The biochemistry of the behavioral  abnormalities as observed in comorbid conditions is already reported to involve  neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT) and  dopamine (DA). The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of ayurvedic  medicines on neurotransmitter levels in IMR 32. Such a study will give some  insight into the molecular mechanism of the action of these medicines and help  us to understand their contributions in neurotransmitter homeostasis. METHODS: Solutions of Brahmi, Brahmi vati, Brahmi ghrita and Saraswata ghrita,  each at 50 μM, were added to differentiated IMR 32 cells and grown for 24 h. The  cell secretion was analysed by ultra-fast liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometry (UFLC/MS) in electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode for the  neurotransmitters DA, 5-HT and GABA. The mobile phase selected was 0.1% formic  acid with 15 μg/mL Na2 -EDTA (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B)  introduced in the ratio of 92:8. RESULTS: All neurotransmitters under study were eluted within 7 min with GABA  eluting at 3.82 min, 5-HT at 4.48 min and DA at 5.47 min, respectively.  Linearity was excellent with a correlation coefficient (R(2) ) of 0.999;  repeatability and accuracy were also within acceptable range. All herbal drugs  evaluated increased the neurotransmitter levels and Brahmi vati increased the  neurotransmitter levels to a larger extent. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased levels of neurotransmitters were observed in behavioral  abnormalities which were also observed in children with ASD. Herbal medicines  given as part of ayurvedic medicine increased the neurotransmitter levels in IMR  32. Thus, these ayurvedic medicines when prescribed to children with ASD might  alleviate the abnormal behavioral symptoms by maintaining neurotransmitter  homeostasis. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","According to 'Mass spectrometric evaluation of neurotransmitter levels in IMR 32 cell line in response to Ayurvedic medicines', certain Ayurvedic herbal medicines might help improve the behavior of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study looked at how these medicines could affect chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, which are linked to behavior. The results showed that these Ayurvedic medicines increased the levels of these neurotransmitters. So, if these Ayurvedic medicines are given to people with ASD, they might help balance their behavior by keeping these neurotransmitter levels in check."
I've heard that some plants can be really good for your health. Are there any natural remedies that could help me maintain my liver health?,"Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb. is a medicinal plant used for the treatment  of various ailments in the traditional system of medicine like Ayurveda where it  has been prescribed as a rejuvenator and general health tonic. The fruit of the  plant is one of the components of the age old ayurvedic formulation-'Triphala'.  The present study evaluates curative effect of aqueous acetone extract of  Terminalia bellirica fruits (AATB) against CCl4 induced oxidative stress and  liver damage in an animal model. Two doses of the fruit extract (200mg/kg body  weight and 400mg/kg body weight) were investigated for the beneficial effects.  At the end of the treatment, liver function markers (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH,  total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin-globulin ratio) as  well as hepatic oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, GSH) were evaluated.  Treatment with AATB significantly restored the parameters towards normal level  as compared to the elevated biochemical markers in the CCl4 treated animals.  Reversal to normal tissue architecture was observed in histological evaluation.  The results of AATB (400mg/kg) were found comparable with that of standard drug  silymarin in all the parameters. The above findings suggest the therapeutic  potential of the plant in alleviating hepatic oxidative stress and tissue  damage, hence the traditional use of the plant in this regard stands justified.","According to 'Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruit mitigates CCl(4) induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity in rats', the fruit of the Terminalia Bellirica plant, often used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, could help improve your liver health. If your liver's been damaged, like by toxins or heavy drinking, taking extracts from this fruit might help your liver recover by reducing harmful stress and damage on a cellular level. The research found that the effects were pretty similar to what's seen with a standard drug used for liver issues. So, it's like a natural detox for your liver!"

I've heard about Ashwagandha being used in traditional medicine. Can it really help prevent or treat diseases like cancer?,"Withaferin A (WA) is a pivotal withanolide that has conquered a conspicuous  place in research, owning to its multidimensional biological properties. It is  an abundant constituent in Withania somnifera Dunal. (Ashwagandha, WS) that is  one of the prehistoric pivotal remedies in Ayurveda. This article reviews the  literature about the pharmacological profile of WA with special emphasis on its  anticancer aspect. We reviewed research publications concerning WA through four  databases and provided a descriptive analysis of literature without statistical  or qualitative analysis. WA has been found as an effective remedy with  multifaceted mechanisms and a broad spectrum of pharmacological profiles. It has  anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiherpetic, antifibrotic, antiplatelet,  profibrinolytic, immunosuppressive, antipigmentation, antileishmanial, and  healing potentials. Evidence for wide pharmacological actions of WA has been  established by both in vivo and in vitro studies. Further, the scientific  literature accentuates the role of WA harboring a variable therapeutic spectrum  for integrative cancer chemoprevention and cure. WA is a modern drug from  traditional medicine that is necessary to be advanced to clinical trials for  advocating its utility as a commercial drug.","According to 'Withaferin A: From Ancient Remedy to Potential Drug Candidate', Withaferin A (WA) is a substance found in a plant called Ashwagandha, which has been used in traditional medicine for a long time. The cool thing about this substance is that it has a lot of health benefits. It can potentially help fight cancer, inflammation, and even has healing properties. The research found that it can be used in many ways, but they're especially excited about its potential in preventing and treating cancer. So it's like an old-school remedy that's now getting a modern twist. The scientists think it's worth doing more research to see if it can be turned into a commercial drug."
Who can I reach out to for some health advice at VU Medisch Centrum?,"Author information: (1)VU Medisch Centrum, Postbus 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam. boris.kanen@vumc.nl","According to 'Chronic lead intoxication associated with Ayurvedic medication', some Ayurvedic medications might have lead in them which can be harmful if you take them for a long time.

I've been feeling really stressed out lately and it's messing with my mood and health. Is there a natural remedy or supplement that could help me out?,"Siotone (ST) is a herbal formulation comprising of Withania somnifera, Ocimum  sanctum, Asparagus racemosus, Tribulus terristris and shilajit, all of which are  classified in Ayurveda as rasayanas which are reputed to promote physical and  mental health, improve defence mechanisms of the body and enhance longevity.  These attributes are similar to the modern concept of adaptogenic agents, which  are, known to afford protection of the human physiological system against  diverse stressors. The present study was undertaken to investigate the  adaptogenic activity of ST against chronic unpredictable, but mild, footshock  stress induced perturbations in behaviour (depression), glucose metabolism,  suppressed male sexual behaviour, immunosuppression and cognitive dysfunction in  CF strain albino rats. Gastric ulceration, adrenal gland and spleen weights,  ascorbic acid and corticosterone concentrations of adrenal cortex, and plasma  corticosterone levels, were used as the stress indices. Panax ginseng (PG) was  used as the standard adaptogenic agent for comparison. Additionally, rat brain  levels of tribulin, an endogenous endocoid postulated to be involved in stress,  were also assessed in terms of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and MAOB  inhibitory activity. Chronic unpredictable footshock induced marked gastric  ulceration, significant increase in adrenal gland weight and plasma  corticosterone levels, with concomitant decreases in spleen weight, and  concentrations of adrenal gland ascorbic acid and corticosterone. These effects  were attenuated by ST (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg, p.o.),  administered once daily over a period of 14 days, the period of stress  induction. Chronic stress also induced glucose intolerance, suppressed male  sexual behaviour, induced behavioural depression (Porsolt's swim despair test  and learned helplessness test) and cognitive dysfunction (attenuated retention  of learning in active and passive avoidance tests), and immunosuppression  (leucocyte migration inhibition and sheep RBC challenged increase in paw oedema  in sensitized rats). All these chronic stress-induced perturbations were  attenuated, dose-dependently by ST (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg,  p.o.). Chronic stress-induced increase in rat brain tribulin activity was also  reversed by these doses of ST and by PG. The results indicate that ST has  significant adaptogenic activity, qualitatively comparable to PG, against a  variety of behavioural, biochemical and physiological perturbations induced by  unpredictable stress, which has been proposed to be a better indicator of  clinical stress than acute stress parameters. The likely contribution of the  individual constituents of ST in the observed adaptogenic action of the  polyherbal formulation, have been discussed.","According to 'Adaptogenic activity of Siotone, a polyherbal formulation of Ayurvedic rasayanas', Siotone is a herbal mixture that can help your body deal with stress. It's made up of five herbs known for promoting physical and mental health, and it works similarly to adaptogens that protect us against different kinds of stress. This study tested Siotone on rats that were exposed to constant, unpredictable mild stress. The results showed that Siotone helped reduce stress effects like stomach ulcers, changes in weight of certain glands, changes in blood sugar, decreased sex drive, and symptoms of depression. It also improved learning and memory and boosted the immune system. These effects were similar to those of Panax gins"
"I've been thinking about trying Ayurvedic medicine for some skin issues. But, is there any risk of lead poisoning or something like that?","Ayurvedic medicines have been gaining in popularity around the world in recent  decades, but have also been associated with lead contamination and poisoning. In  2012 in Durban, South Africa, a lead poisoning outbreak among adolescents was  associated with the consumption of an Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of  skin conditions. In 2014 eight individuals (out of 12 affected) were traced and  interviewed. Questionnaires were administered; blood samples were taken for lead  content analysis; and medical records were reviewed. Samples of the implicated  medicines were analyzed to determine lead levels. Blood lead levels during the  acute phase ranged from 34 to 116 µg/dL; and during the current study (two years  later) from 13 to 34 µg/dL. The implicated lead capsules had a lead content of  125,235 µg/g. Participants suffered a wide range of non-specific ill health  symptoms; and there was a significant delay in the diagnosis of lead poisoning.  This study highlights the potential for lead poisoning outbreaks from the  consumption of Ayurvedic medicines in African settings. There were weaknesses  with regard to the diagnosis of and response to the outbreak, for which measures  need to be put in place to ensure greater awareness of the role of Ayurvedic  medicine in lead poisoning, and prompt diagnosis and treatment of future cases.","According to 'Retrospective Investigation of a Lead Poisoning Outbreak from the Consumption of an Ayurvedic Medicine: Durban, South Africa', Ayurvedic medicines, though popular, can sometimes have harmful effects. For instance, a few years ago in South Africa, some young people got really sick from lead poisoning because they were taking a certain Ayurvedic medicine for skin problems. This research shows that it's crucial to be aware of what's in these medicines and to get help quickly if you start feeling unwell."
I've been having trouble sleeping and heard about this Ayurvedic medicine called Rasasindura. Is it safe to use and does it have any side effects?,"Rasasindura (RS) is an Ayurvedic medicine, which contains ∼99% α-HgS. It is used  as a rejuvenating agent and commonly used to treat diseases such as syphilis,  insomnia, high fever, and nervous disorders. Cinnabar ore (α-HgS) is a  well-known mineral, which is readily available. Despite it, Ayurvedic  practitioners adopted an involved and tedious procedure for the preparation of  RS. In this study, three samples, one was Ayurvedic (RS), the second one was the  commercial (HGS), and the third one was cinnabar ore (CN), were physiochemically  examined. Zebrafish model was employed for toxicity study with an oral dose of  100 mg/kg/day for the three samples for 10 days. We found that RS conferred  novel physicochemical properties, which were not seen in HGS and CN.  Significantly, the average crystallite size of RS was lowest (26 nm) as compared  to HGS (31 nm) and CN (34 nm), and the rate of increase of crystallite size with  temperature was lowest in RS. RS did not show any significant behavioral  toxicity in zebrafish, which was seen with the HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish.  HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish showed a significantly high (∗∗∗p < 0.001) decrease  (77 ± 7.6% and 51 ± 6.5%, respectively) of glutathione (GSH) levels in the  brain, however, for RS-treated zebrafish, the change of GSH was insignificant  (26 ± 2.5%, p > 0.05). Interestingly, HGS significantly altered the  γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in brain tissue. Therefore, among all three samples,  RS exhibited the lowest toxicity, which can be credited to the distinct  toxicokinetics by these samples.","According to 'Ayurvedic processing of α-HgS gives novel physicochemistry and distinct toxicokinetics in zebrafish', an Ayurvedic medicine named Rasasindura (RS) is safer than its raw materials. This medicine, which is often used for conditions like insomnia and high fever, is made from a mineral called cinnabar ore. The researchers tested both the raw mineral and the processed medicine on zebrafish and found that the fish given the raw mineral showed signs of toxicity, while those given the processed medicine didn't. So, just like how uncooked meat can be dangerous, but cooked meat isn't, this study shows that how a medicine is processed can make a big difference in safety."

I've been hearing about this Shatavaryadi churna stuff for boosting immunity and energy. Is it legit and how can I make sure I'm getting the real deal?,"Validated modified lycopodium spore method has been developed for simple and  rapid quantification of herbal powdered drugs. Lycopodium spore method was  performed on ingredients of Shatavaryadi churna, an ayurvedic formulation used  as immunomodulator, galactagogue, aphrodisiac and rejuvenator. Estimation of  diagnostic characters of each ingredient of Shatavaryadi churna individually was  carried out. Microscopic determination, counting of identifying number,  measurement of area, length and breadth of identifying characters were performed  using Leica DMLS-2 microscope. The method was validated for intraday precision,  linearity, specificity, repeatability, accuracy and system suitability,  respectively. The method is simple, precise, sensitive, and accurate, and can be  used for routine standardisation of raw materials of herbal drugs. This method  gives the ratio of individual ingredients in the powdered drug so that any  adulteration of genuine drug with its adulterant can be found out. The method  shows very good linearity value between 0.988-0.999 for number of identifying  character and area of identifying character. Percentage purity of the sample  drug can be determined by using the linear equation of standard genuine drug.","According to the research paper titled 'Validated modified Lycopodium spore method development for standardisation of ingredients of an ayurvedic powdered formulation Shatavaryadi churna', scientists have made a new method to quickly check the contents of herbal powdered drugs.

I've been hearing a lot about this Mahasudarshan Churna stuff. Can it really help boost my immunity and digestion?,"BACKGROUND: Mahasudarshan Churna (MC) is a polyherbal Ayurvedic medicine that is  employed in fever (especially chronic type), cold and malaria, improvement of  digestion and appetite, removes toxins from the blood, boosts immunity and  protects against common bacterial infections. METHODS: Validation and quantification of oleanolic acid (OA), ursolic acid  (UA), mangiferin (M), gallic acid (GA), quercetin (Q) and curcumin (C) in  commercial MC formulations by HPTLC method. Mobile phase, hexane: ethyl acetate:  acetone (16.4: 3.6: 0.2, v/v) was used for the separation of OA and UA; ethyl  acetate: glacial acetic acid: formic acid: water (20: 2.2: 2.2: 5.2 v/v) for the  development of M; and toluene: ethyl acetate: formic acid (13.5: 9: 0.6 v/v) for  the separation of GA, Q and C in crude sample extracts. Visualization and  scanning were performed at λ = 530 nm for OA and UA, at λ = 254 nm for M and at  λ = 366 nm for GA, Q and C. In addition, HPLC-PDA analysis was used to confirm  the HPTLC results. RESULTS: Major bio-active compounds in MC formulations were oleanolic acid  (1.54-1.78%), mangiferin (1.38-1.52%) and gallic acid (1.01-1.15%); followed by  ursolic acid (0.79-0.98%), curcumin (0.45-0.67%) and quercetin (0.22-0.34%). CONCLUSION: Analysis of bio-active compounds in the present study was performed  using HPTLC methods and later HPTLC results were compared with HPLC. These two  methods give comparable results and there was no statistically significant  difference between the mean values for all extracts. Present study concluded  that this HPTLC technique is low cost, fast, precise, and accurate which can be  employed for the quantification of xanthonoid (M), triterpenoids (OA, UA) and  phenolics (GA, Q and C) in samples/formulations. Furthermore, present HPTLC  method can be conveniently employed for routine quality control analysis of all  the six marker compounds in marketed Ayurvedic/herbal formulations.","According to 'Validation and quantification of major biomarkers in 'Mahasudarshan Churna'- an ayurvedic polyherbal formulation through high-performance thin-layer chromatography', this traditional Ayurvedic medicine known as Mahasudarshan Churna is packed with natural compounds that can help in various ways like fighting off colds, improving digestion, and boosting your immune system. The research studied the key components in this remedy and found that it contains beneficial elements like oleanolic acid, mangiferin, and gallic acid. They used a cool science technique called 'high-performance thin-layer chromatography' to identify and measure these ingredients, proving that this method is a quick and cost-effective way to check the quality of herbal"
"So, I've heard Ashwagandha might be good for general health, but does it have any benefits in preventing cancer or is that just a myth?","Ashwagandha, also called as ""Queen of Ayurveda"" and ""Indian ginseng"", is a  commonly used plant in Indian traditional medicine, Ayurveda. Its roots have  been used as herb remedy to treat a variety of ailments and to promote general  wellness. However, scientific evidence to its effects is limited to only a small  number of studies. We had previously identified anti-cancer activity in the leaf  extract (i-Extract) of Ashwagandha and demonstrated withanone as a cancer  inhibitory factor (i-Factor). In the present study, we fractionated the  i-Extract to its components by silica gel column chromatography and subjected  them to cell based activity analyses. We found that the cancer inhibitory leaf  extract (i-Extract) has, at least, seven components that could cause cancer cell  killing; i-Factor showed the highest selectivity for cancer cells and i-Factor  rich Ashwagandha leaf powder was non-toxic and anti-tumorigenic in mice assays.  We undertook a gene silencing and pathway analysis approach and found that  i-Extract and its components kill cancer cells by at least five different  pathways, viz. p53 signaling, GM-CFS signaling, death receptor signaling,  apoptosis signaling and G2-M DNA damage regulation pathway. p53 signaling was  most common. Visual analysis of p53 and mortalin staining pattern further  revealed that i-Extract, fraction F1, fraction F4 and i-Factor caused an  abrogation of mortalin-p53 interactions and reactivation of p53 function while  the fractions F2, F3, F5 work through other mechanisms.","According to 'Selective killing of cancer cells by leaf extract of Ashwagandha: components, activity and pathway analyses', the leaf extract of a plant called Ashwagandha, which is commonly used in Indian traditional medicine, might be a natural way to fight cancer. Researchers found that this plant has components that can kill cancer cells. This was tested in mice and it didn't cause any harm, so it could potentially be a useful tool in cancer treatment. The study also found that these components kill cancer cells through different ways, but mostly through a process called p53 signaling. This is like kicking a bad guy out of a party - the p53 is the bouncer, and the bad guy is the cancer cell. So, Ash"
"I've been using some herbal stuff for my back pain that I got while visiting India, but now I'm feeling weird and losing weight. Could the herbs be messing with my health somehow?","Use of traditional folkloric remedies not disclosed to the physician may be  difficult to identify as a source of lead toxicity. This report illustrates the  presentation of a 26-year-old man who, during his 1 month vacation in India, was  treated for low back pain with Ayurvedic herbal medicine. On his return to the  USA, he presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain, weight loss,  dark stools, nausea and vomiting. He was admitted and noted to be anaemic with a  blood lead level (BLL) of 94.8 µg/dL. Peripheral blood smear demonstrated  basophilic stippling. Chelation therapy with succimer was initiated. The patient  became asymptomatic within months. Three years later, he remained asymptomatic  with BLL <20 µg/dL. Physicians should be cognisant of potential toxicity from  these Ayurvedic medications and have a heightened level of suspicion for lead  toxicity in the face of anaemia and abdominal pain without obvious cause.","According to 'Case of acute lead toxicity associated with Ayurvedic supplements', sometimes traditional or herbal remedies can be harmful if not used correctly. In this case, a guy went to India and took some Ayurvedic medicine for back pain. When he got back to the US, he was really sick with stomach pain, weight loss, and other symptoms. Turns out, the medicine he took had lead in it and it was making him sick. After some treatment, he got better. So, it's really important to be careful with what you're taking and to let your doctor know about any herbal or traditional medicines you're using. They might have harmful stuff in them that you don't know about."
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda recently. Are there any natural ways it suggests to help slow down aging or rejuvenate my body?,"The disease preventive and health promotive approach of 'Ayurveda', which takes  into consideration the whole body, mind and spirit while dealing with the  maintenance of health, promotion of health and treating ailments is holistic and  finds increasing acceptability in many regions of the world. Ancient Ayurvedic  physicians had developed certain dietary and therapeutic measures to  arrest/delay ageing and rejuvenating whole functional dynamics of the body  system. This revitalization and rejuvenation is known as the 'Rasayan chikitsa'  (rejuvenation therapy). Traditionally, Rasayana drugs are used against a  plethora of seemingly diverse disorders with no pathophysiological connections  according to modern medicine. Though, this group of plants generally possesses  strong antioxidant activity, only a few have been investigated in detail. Over  about 100 disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, hemorrhagic shock, CVS disorders,  cystic fibrosis, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases,  gastrointestinal ulcerogenesis and AIDS have been reported as reactive oxygen  species mediated. In this review, the role of free radicals in these diseases  has been briefly reviewed. 'Rasayana' plants with potent antioxidant activity  have been reviewed for their traditional uses, and mechanism of antioxidant  action. Fifteen such plants have been dealt with in detail and some more plants  with less work have also been reviewed briefly.","According to 'Antioxidant approach to disease management and the role of 'Rasayana' herbs of Ayurveda', Ayurveda is an ancient health approach that not only treats illnesses, but also promotes overall health, kind of like a wellness routine for your body and mind. It includes a special rejuvenation therapy called 'Rasayana chikitsa', which uses certain plants to help slow down aging and revitalize the body. These plants are like nature's own antioxidants and can help the body fight off a bunch of different health problems. Even though we don't fully understand how all these plants work just yet, they can potentially help with over 100 health issues like arthritis, stomach ulcers, and even AIDS. So"
"So, I've heard about this Ayurvedic medicine called tarakeswara rasa. Can it actually help lower blood sugar and cholesterol?","Administration of tarakeswara rasa--an ayurvedic drug--to alloxan induced  diabetic rats resulted in a significant decrease in the blood glucose. Its  antidiabetic effect was also evident from the tissue parameters estimated. The  drug administration to diabetic rats also resulted in the reduction of  cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid content.","According to 'Evaluation of antidiabetic effect of an ayurvedic drug, 'tarakeswara rasa' in rats', this Ayurvedic medicine named 'tarakeswara rasa' was given to diabetic rats and it significantly reduced their blood sugar levels. This medicine also helped in decreasing other stuff like cholesterol and triglycerides in the rats. So, if it works in humans like it did in rats, it could be a big help to people with diabetes."
"I've been super stressed out lately, is there a natural supplement or something that could help me out?","Withania somnifera (WS) Dunal is classified in Ayurveda, the ancient Hindu  system of medicine, as a rasayana, a group of plant-derived drugs reputed to  promote physical and mental health, augment resistance of the body against  disease and diverse adverse environmental factors, revitalise the body in  debilitated conditions and increase longevity. These attributes are remarkably  similar to the properties ascribed to adaptogens like Panax ginseng (PG) in  contemporary medicine. As such, the adaptogenic activity of a standardised  extract of WS roots was investigated against a rat model of chronic stress (CS).  The stress procedure was mild, unpredictable footshock, administered once daily  for 21 days to adult male Wistar rats. CS induced significant hyperglycaemia,  glucose intolerance, increase in plasma corticosterone levels, gastric  ulcerations, male sexual dysfunction, cognitive deficits, immunosuppression and  mental depression. These CS induced perturbations were attenuated by WS (25 and  50 mg/kg po) and by PG (100 mg/kg po), administered 1 h before footshock for 21  days. The results indicate that WS, like PG, has significant antistress  adaptogenic activity, confirming the clinical use of the plant in Ayurveda.","According to 'Adaptogenic activity of Withania somnifera: an experimental study using a rat model of chronic stress', Withania somnifera, also known as Indian ginseng, is a plant often used in traditional Indian medicine. It's believed to help the body handle stress, boost health, fight off sickness, and even help with things like stomach ulcers and memory problems. It's pretty similar to how people use ginseng today. Some scientists tested it on stressed-out rats, and found it really does seem to help with stress-related issues. So, if you're feeling stressed or rundown, this plant might be something to look into."
Are the herbal products I'm buying from the Himalayan region safe from heavy metals or should I be worried about that?,"Various herbal products from Himalayan region may provide a huge source of  supply in the domestic and international markets. In this study, the heavy metal  load in various herbal drugs of the region was investigated. The studied toxic  elements were present in the herbal drugs (0.2-8.34 mg/kg As, 0.11-0.48 mg/kg  Cd, 2.5-6.0 mg/kg Pb). Zinc was found in the range 7-32 mg/kg and all the  samples were free from mercury contamination.","According to 'Metals in herbal drugs from Himalayan region', some of the herbal products from the Himalayas were found to have a bit of heavy metals in them. This doesn't mean they're dangerous or anything, but it's something to keep in mind. They also found zinc in them, which is actually good for your body. Plus, there wasn't any mercury, which is a relief because that's not something you want in your body."
My eyes always feel dry and tired. Are there any natural remedies that could help with this?,"A double masked placebo controlled multicentric randomised clinical trial was  conducted in 157 patients suffering from different eye ailments namely,  cataract, dry eye syndrome, ocular asthenia, refractive errors and allergic  conjunctivitis with a herbal eye drop preparation and placebo. In both dry eye  syndrome and ocular asthenia the herbal eye drop preparation was found better  than placebo. In a few cases of cataract, the vision seems to be improved. In  early myopia it seems to correct the refractive errors while in high myopic  conditions it controlled the progressive deteriorations. Subjective improvements  were also noted with hypermetropia, presbyopia and astigmatism. Its healing  capacity in allergic conjunctivitis was certainly better than placebo. It had no  short term or long term side-effects.

The drops turned out to be pretty good, especially for people who have dry eyes and tired eyes. They even helped some people with cataracts see a bit better. If you're nearsighted, they could help correct that or at least stop it from getting worse. Plus, they also helped with some other vision issues and allergies. Best part is, they didn't have any bad side effects. So, these eye drops could be a decent solution for a bunch of different eye issues."
"Are there any specific plants or herbs I could include in my diet that could boost my health, according to Ayurvedic medicine?","Specific parts of several plants (fruits, leaves, stem, bark, and roots) often  used as medicines in the Indian Ayurvedic system have been analysed for 20  elements (As, Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se,  Sr and Zn) by employing instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The  samples were irradiated with thermal neutrons in a nuclear reactor and the  induced activity was counted using high resolution gamma ray spectrometry.

It's like a liver super-shield! This suggests it could be a useful tool in taking care of your liver health."
I don't live near a hospital and don't have great internet. Is there a cheap and easy way for me to monitor my health regularly from home?,"Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers,  depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments  that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and  even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction  of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and  to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives  have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and  low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent  connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these  concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health  platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological  parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of  emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to  manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of  patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness  and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring  system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1)  empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural  patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding  nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on  vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health  center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports  community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting  of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to  Internet.","According to 'Personalized Health Monitoring System for Managing Well-Being in Rural Areas', people living in rural parts of India often don't have easy access to doctors or medical facilities. This can make it difficult for them to get help for common health problems, which can sometimes lead to serious complications or even death. To help solve this problem, a new system has been designed that uses cheap wearable health devices that don't need a constant internet connection. These devices can monitor a person's health in real time and provide personalized advice in their local language about things like nutrition, exercise, diet, and preventive care. They can also alert doctors in case of an emergency. This new system can help community health workers to better diagnose and manage the health of rural patients"
I've been thinking about trying some Ayurvedic supplements like Brahmi Vati or Saraswat Churna. Should I be worried about heavy metals or pesticides in them?,"OBJECTIVE: Ayurvedic formulations are preferred over other formulations as well  as commercialized on broad level to treat various ailments. The World Health  Organization has established certain guidelines for quality control of heavy  metals and pesticide residues. Bacopa monnieri, a popular herb with  immunomodulator and memory-enhancing properties is the chief constituent of  several Ayurvedic formulations, which include Brahmi Vati (BV), Brahmi Ghrita  (BG) and Saraswat Churna (SC), etc. In view of the World Health Organization  guidelines, two products of each formulation from six different manufacturers  were purchased from Ayurvedic Pharmacy, Bulanala-Varanasi, India for testing  heavy metal and pesticide residue. METHODS: In the present study, all the formulations--BV, BG and SC--were  selected for estimation of four heavy metals namely lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd),  chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) by a plasma emission spectrophotometer.  Organochlorine pesticidal residues were estimated for dichlorodiphenyl  trichloroethane, isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and α-endosulfan, etc.  in total 12 samples of test formulations containing Bacopa monnieri L. using gas  chromatography technique. RESULTS: Out of 12 samples, Pb, Cd, Cr and Ni were present in all samples but  below the permissible limit. Although atrazine, aldrin, dialdrin were in below  detection limit, but other pesticides were detected in some samples as oxamyl,  hexachlorocyclohexanes (α-HCH, β-HCH and γ-HCH), dichlorodiphenyl  trichloroethane and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene. CONCLUSION: The presence of heavy metals in the formulations was low to cause  toxicity. However evaluation of heavy metals and pesticide residue in every  batch is necessary.","According to 'Studies on metals and pesticide content in some Ayurvedic formulations containing Bacopa monnieri L.', popular Ayurvedic supplements like Brahmi Vati, Brahmi Ghrita, and Saraswat Churna were checked for heavy metals and pesticides. All samples had some metals, but not enough to be harmful. However, some samples had pesticides in them. So, even though these supplements are generally safe, it's important that they're checked for these things regularly. Think of it like checking the ingredients in your food - you want to make sure you're not taking something that could be bad for you."
"So, there's this local healer in my town who seems to cure people using some unconventional methods. How can I tell if his techniques are legit or just a scam?","To understand the workings of medicine, healing, placebo, belief, and  rationality, medical anthropologists need to pay attention to the complex  relations of various forms of revelation, contemplation, and rejoining  revelation that attach to illness and healing. In this article two performances  of a healing technique located in the agricultural plain of Chhattisgarh,  central India, are compared: one representing scientific rationality; the other  'blind' superstition. In both performances the practitioner's aim is to reveal:  the local healer reveals witchcraft objects from the afflicted body; the local  rationalist society reveals the healer's technique as a fraudulent trick. Each  performance shares 'an aesthetics of revelation'-they rely on seeing or  revealing to obtain their social effect. The interplay between forms of  revelation, a reliance on aesthetics for the revelation, and the ways of seeing  can indicate how distinctions are made (or not) between doctor and quack,  expertise and gimmickry, and truth and falsehood.","According to 'Skillful Revelation: Local Healers, Rationalists, and Their 'Trickery' in Chhattisgarh, Central India', medical experts are looking at how local healers and doctors in Central India reveal the secrets behind their healing techniques. They found that both groups use a kind of 'show and tell' method to gain trust, but in different ways. The local healer might show an object they say is causing sickness, while the scientific folks might reveal how that's just a trick. It's a bit like the difference between a magician's trick and the behind-the-scenes explanation of how it's done. This kind of 'showing' plays a big role in how people decide who's a legit doctor and who's"
"So, there's this Indian herbal thing called Mentat that's supposed to help with endurance and learning. Is it something I could use to study longer without getting tired?","A nine week cross over study (5 weeks drug administration and 4 weeks  withdrawal) was performed to see the effect of a composite Indian herbal  preparation (CIHP III), viz. Mentat, on avoidance learning during endurance  performance of albino rats. Runimex, a circular runway was used for this  purpose. The number of stimuli viz. electrical shock of 10 mv, in drug treated  rats at an oral dose of 47.86 mg/100 g body wt/single dose/day for 5 days were  significantly reduced as compared to rats not taking any drug. The number of  stimuli decreased significantly when the drug was started in the control group.  No change in avoidance learning was observed over the period of 9 weeks in  another group of rats. Results indicate significant improvement in avoidance  learning during endurance performance due to the intake of CIHP(III).","According to 'Effect of a composite Indian herbal preparation, CIHP(III) on avoidance learning during endurance performance of rats', scientists gave rats a specific Indian herbal supplement called Mentat, and they found that the rats performed better in a learning and endurance test. This was compared to other rats who didn't take the supplement. The test involved reducing the number of times the rats were given an unpleasant shock. The rats taking the supplement got fewer shocks, meaning they were better at learning to avoid them during the endurance test. This improvement wasn't seen in the rats that didn't take the supplement. So, in simple words, this Indian herb might boost learning and endurance based on this rat study."
"So, I heard there's some sort of link between my genes and these Ayurvedic body types. Can knowing my body type help me understand my health better?","BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, India's natural health care tradition, has a unique way of  classifying human population based on individual constitution or prakriti.  Ayurveda's tridosha theory identifies principles of motion (vata), metabolism  (pitta), and structure (kapha) as discrete phenotypic groupings. Patwardhan et  al. (2005) hypothesized in a paper published in this journal that there is a  genetic connotation to prakriti and as proof of this concept showed a  correlation between HLA alleles and prakriti type, establishing a rationale and  preliminary experimental support for the concept of an association between HLA  alleles and the Ayurvedic tridosha theory of individual prakriti types. This  work is both part of and a catalyst for a wider revolution in the scientific  investigation of Ayurveda in India, referred to as ""Ayurvedic biology"" and  ""AyuGenomics."" Subsequently, Chen et al. (2007) reported a similar study in this  journal using a classification based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)  theory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of a genetic basis for both Ayurvedic and TCM  classifications indicate a commonality between Asia's great medical traditions  in their diagnostic typologies and a genetic basis for Asian traditional  medicine's theory of discrete and discernable groupings of psycho-physiologic  differences. Accordingly, new horizons have opened for collaborative East-East  research and for an individualized approach to disease management and activation  of the full range of human potential, as articulated in Ayurveda and TCM.","According to 'Ayurvedic genomics: establishing a genetic basis for mind-body typologies', Ayurveda, a traditional health care tradition in India, sorts people based on their individual characteristics like motion, metabolism, and structure. In recent studies, it seems like these classifications could be linked to our genes. This is huge because it might mean traditional Asian medicine, like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, could have a genetic basis. This opens up a lot of possibilities for personalized healthcare and treatments in the future."
"So, I've heard that diabetes and Alzheimer's might be connected. Can certain herbs or natural remedies help with both?","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This review explores the link between Type 2  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and diabetes-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). It  emphasizes the shared pathophysiological links and mechanisms between the two  conditions, focusing on reduced insulin levels and receptors, impaired glucose  metabolism, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative damage  in AD-affected brains-paralleling aspects of T2DM. The review suggests AD as a  ""diabetes of the brain,"" supported by cognitive enhancement through antidiabetic  interventions. It focuses on the traditionally used Indian herbs as a means to  manage both conditions while addressing developmental challenges. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study explores the DM-AD connection, reviewing medicinal  herbs with protective potential for both ailments, considering traditional uses  and developmental challenges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studied research, reviews, and ethnobotanical and  scientific data from electronic databases and traditional books. RESULTS: The study analyzes the pathophysiological links between DM and AD,  emphasizing their interconnected factors. Eight Ayurvedic plants with dual  protective effects against T2DM and AD are thoroughly reviewed with  preclinical/clinical evidence. Historical context, phytoconstituents, and  traditional applications are explored. Innovative formulations using these  plants are examined. Challenges stemming from phytoconstituents' physicochemical  properties are highlighted, prompting novel formulation development, including  nanotechnology-based delivery systems. The study uncovers obstacles in  formulating treatments for these diseases. CONCLUSION: The review showcases the dual potential of chosen medicinal herbs  against both diseases, along with their traditional applications, endorsing  their use. It addresses formulation obstacles, proposing innovative delivery  technologies for herbal therapies, while acknowledging their constraints. The  review suggests the need for heightened investment and research in this area.","According to 'Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease: Understanding disease mechanisms, their correlation, and promising dual activity of selected herbs', there's a connection between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. It's like Alzheimer's is a type of diabetes that affects the brain. The research also found that some traditional Indian herbs could help with both conditions. However, it's a bit tricky to create treatments using these herbs, so more research and investment are needed. But who knows? Maybe in the future, we'll see new, innovative therapies based on these herbs."
Can certain plants or extracts help protect my body against damage from things like unhealthy fats or oils?,Antiperoxidative property of N. jatamanasi was tested by using iron induced  lipid peroxidation in 5% rat liver homogenate. The degree of peroxidation was  quantitated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) content. The  extract provided protection against lipid peroxidation. The hexane fraction was  more potent than the alcoholic extract. Results suggested antilipid peroxidative  property of the plant.,"According to 'Antilipid peroxidative property of Nardostachys jatamansi', this plant seems to have properties that can protect against cell damage in the liver, at least in rats. The research found that one type of extract from the plant was even more effective than another. So, this might suggest that this plant could potentially be used to help keep our liver cells healthy."
"I've heard about this pomegranate syrup called Madhulai Manappagu that's supposed to help with anemia. Is it safe to take, or are there any known side effects?","OBJECTIVES: Madhulai Manappagu - a well-known sastric and widely prescribed  Siddha herbal syrup formulation indicated for treating Veluppu Noi (Anaemia  especially Iron deficiency Anaemia) has been in day today practice in Tamil Nadu  for a quite longer decades. The syrup is a herbal preparation which has a sweet  pleasant odour and a palatable taste, contain the juice of pomegranate (Punica  granatum L.) as the main ingredient. Though the formulation is a fruit juice,  the safety profile of the syrup is not established and is being marketed without  toxicological evaluation. The study is aimed at ascertaining the acute and  sub-acute toxicity assessment of Madhulai Manappagu in Wistar Albino rats. METHODS: The acute and sub-acute (28day repeated oral) toxicity studies were  performed as per the guidelines mentioned in the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) 423 (adopted on December 2001) and TG 407  (adopted on October 2008) with slight modifications respectively. For acute  toxicity study, three female rats were randomly selected as control; three  female rats were randomly selected and were administered a single dose of  5,000 mg/kg body weight per oral route. For sub-acute (28day repeated oral)  toxicity studies, three doses of test drug MM of 500 mg/kg/day (low dose),  750 mg/kg/day (intermittent dose) and 1,000 mg/kg/day (high dose) were selected  for administration. Both sexes of Wistar Albino rats were randomized into four  groups of 10 animals each (five males, five females). Group I was kept as  control group. Group II, III and IV served as low, intermittent and high doses  of MM respectively. Animals were observed for mortality, morbidity, body weight  changes, feed and water intake. Haematology, clinical biochemistry,  electrolytes, gross pathology, relative organ weight and histopathological  examination were performed. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity study, rats showed no toxicological signs on  behavior, gross pathology and body weight of rats when treated with a single  dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight per oral route. In the subacute (28 days  repeated oral) toxicity study, rats have showed no significant changes on  behavior, gross pathology, body weight, and hematological and biochemical  parameters when treated with Madhulai Manappagu in three different doses. CONCLUSIONS: The toxicity studies which include both acute and 28 days repeated  (subacute) oral toxicity studies, revealed no observed adverse effect level  (NOAEL) of Madhulai Manappagu in animals. Thus the safety of the drug in human  usage was ensured.","According to 'Acute and subacute toxicity assessment of Madhulai Manappagu (Siddha herbal syrup formulation) in animal model', Madhulai Manappagu is a herbal syrup that's been used for a long time in Tamil Nadu, India to treat anemia. It's made mainly from pomegranate juice. The research was done to check if it's safe for use and they did this by testing it on lab rats. The findings showed that even when given in large amounts, the syrup didn't harm the rats or change their behavior, body weight, or health. So, it seems like Madhulai Manappagu is safe for people to use."
I've been hearing about this plant called 'vidarikanda' that's supposed to be good for your health. What's it all about and what can it do for me?,"Pueraria tuberosa (Willd.) DC is a perennial herb commonly known as  'vidarikanda', distributed throughout south east Asia. The plant's tuber is  widely used in ethanomedicine as well as in traditional systems of medicine,  particularly in ayurveda. It has been used in various ayurvedic formulations as  restorative tonic, antiaging, spermatogenic and immune booster and has been  recommended for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, hepatosplenomegaly,  fertility disorders, menopausal syndrome, sexual debility and spermatorrhoea.  Numerous bioactive phytochemicals, mostly isoflavonoids such as puerarin,  genistein, daidzein, tuberosin and so on have been identified in the tuber. In  vivo and in vitro studies have provided the support against traditional demands  of the tuber as spermatogenic, immune booster, aphrodisiac, anti-inflammatory,  cardiotonic and brain tonic. However, further studies are required to define the  active phytochemical compositions and to validate its clinical utilisation in  the herbal formulations for human uses. This review provides an overview of  traditional applications, current knowledge on the phytochemistry, pharmacology  and toxicology of P. tuberosa. This review also provides plausible hypotheses  about how various isoflavones particularly puerarin, genistein and daidzein,  individually or collectively, may be responsible for the therapeutic potential  against a wide range of ailments.","According to 'Pueraria tuberosa: a review on its phytochemical and therapeutic potential', there's a plant called 'vidarikanda' commonly found in southeast Asia that's pretty amazing.

I've been having some seizures and I heard about this herbal thing called Siotone granule. Could this help me out?,"Siotone granule, a herbal psychotropic formulation was tested for its  effectiveness in various models of convulsions in animals. S. granule (100 and  200 mg/kg) offered significant protection against pentylenetetrazol-, maximal  electroshock- and strychnine-induced convulsions. In hypoxic stress-induced  convulsions only 200 mg/kg was effective. It also reduced percent mortality per  se and rendered total protection when given in combination with sub-protective  dose of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) against  pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. The anticonvulsant action of S. granule  was blocked by flumazenil (4 mg/kg) suggesting the involvement of GABAergic  mechanism.","According to 'Anticonvulsant profile of Siotone granules, a herbal preparation', a herbal medication named Siotone granule was tested on animals to see if it could help with seizures. The results showed that the medicine did help protect against different types of seizures. Interestingly, the medicine was even more effective when used with a low dose of diazepam, a common anti-seizure drug. However, the positive effects of Siotone granules were blocked by another drug, suggesting that it works through specific pathways in the body."
I've been super stressed lately and I've heard it can affect my health. What's the connection there and how can I prevent it from making me sick?,"Recent research on causes of disease and aging has increasingly supported the  importance of stress. One theory of the relationship between stress and disease  is based on the concept of homeostasis, a term coined by Cannon over 50 years  ago to signify those states and mechanisms responsible for the ""staying power of  the body"". Bernard, Cannon, Selye and other leading researchers held that full,  normal function of the self-regulating or homeostatic power of the body  maintains the balanced, integrated condition we recognize as health. Failures in  this capacity, such as those produced by frequent stressful experiences, can  result in disease or death. Theories of health and disease surprisingly similar  to this have existed since ancient times, and in widely different cultures. This  review discusses both the fundamental elements of these theories and the current  neuroendocrine research supporting their validity and immediate relevance. The  connections between ancient and modern knowledge described herein were made  possible largely by the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a scholar and teacher of  the ancient vedic tradition of India. A key part of Ayurveda that has been  obscure to modern science is the substance ""ojas"", which the classical texts say  maintains balance of the physiology. In this article, specific steroids or  steroid classes are proposed as likely candidates for both the ""ordinary"" and  the ""superior"" types of ojas described in Ayurveda. Current evidence for the  functions of these steroids, as well as their role in stress, disease and the  maintenance of health, is reviewed. The knowledge of Ayurveda, as recently  brought to light by Maharishi, includes methods for recovering and maintaining  optimal function of steroidal systems. Such effects may help mediate the  improvements in health and increased longevity attributed to Ayurveda and other  ancient methods.","According to 'Stress, steroids, and ""ojas"": neuroendocrine mechanisms and current promise of ancient approaches to disease prevention', stress really can make you sick! The way your body deals with stress is important in keeping you healthy. If you're always stressed out, it can lead to health problems and even shorten your life. This idea isn't new. In fact, ancient Indian teachings talk about a substance called ""ojas"" that helps your body stay balanced. Modern science thinks ""ojas"" might actually be certain types of steroids. The cool part is that these ancient teachings also include ways to improve this balance, which could lead to better health and a longer life. So, maybe it's time to try some yoga or meditation to"
I've been hearing a lot about this Giloy plant as a natural remedy for a bunch of stuff. Is it really as good as they say and how can I use it?,"Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) is a medicinal plant used in folk and Ayurvedic  medicines throughout India since ancient times. All the parts of the plant are  immensely useful due to the presence of different compounds of pharmaceutical  importance belonging to various groups as alkaloids, diterpenoid lactones,  glycosides, steroids, sesquiterpenoid, and phenolics. These compounds possess  pharmacological properties, which make it anti-diabetic, antipyretic,  anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hepato-protective, and immuno-modulatory.  However, due to the increasing population, there is an inadequate supply of  drugs. Therefore, this review focuses on phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology,  clinical application and its conservation strategies so that the plant can be  conserved for future generations and utilized as alternative medicine as well as  to design various pharmacologically important drugs.","According to ""Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy): Phytochemistry, Ethnopharmacology, Clinical Application and Conservation Strategies,"" Giloy is a plant that's been used in traditional Indian medicine for a long time. Every part of the plant has some good stuff in it like antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties can help with things like diabetes, fever, liver protection, and even boosting your immune system. But, because there are so many people in the world, there might not be enough of this plant to go around. So, the research is looking into how we can save this plant for future generations and use it to create new medicines."
I've been using this traditional remedy for a while and I'm not feeling too great. Could it be messing with my health somehow?,"An Indian patient referred to Clinica del Lavoro 'L.Devoto' of Milano showed  clinical signs of heavy metal poisoning, possibly related to a sustained 6-month  use of approx. 3 g/day of a traditional preparation (a whitish powder with a  'mineral' appearance) to treat urological problems. To confirm the causal  relationship between the disease and the use of such product, metal testing was  performed on the patient's hair and the ayurvedic remedy samples by total  reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF). For TXRF analysis 1-cm cut of the  patient's hair was directly deposited onto the quartz glass sample carrier, then  10 microl of nitric acid 65% were added and dried in air. TXRF showed high  versatility, rapid and simultaneous element detection, and short analysis time,  thus supporting a wider use in emergency medicine and in forensic analyses.","According to 'Use of total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) for the evaluation of heavy metal poisoning due to the improper use of a traditional ayurvedic drug', a person in India got really sick because they were taking a traditional medicine for bladder issues. The doctors thought it might be due to heavy metals in the medicine, so they tested the person's hair and the medicine itself using a cool technique called TXRF. This technique showed heavy metals in both the hair and the medicine, confirming their suspicions. This quick and effective testing method could be used more often in emergency situations to find out what's making people sick."
I've been feeling really stressed and anxious lately. Could Ayurveda offer any natural remedies to help me chill out?,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India  more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of  primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda  has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the  course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common  spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations  known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins  from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There  are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments,  including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies  presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders,  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.  These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for  conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that  compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic  treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic  treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective  for the benefit of the patient.","So, according to this paper called 'Utilization of Ayurveda in health care: an approach for prevention, health promotion, and treatment of disease. Part 2--Ayurveda in primary health care', Ayurveda is like this ancient health care system from India that's been around for over 5000 years. It's not just about treating sickness, but also about keeping you healthy throughout your life, from when you're a baby to when you're old. They use everyday spices and herbs, and also have special treatments to detox your body. There's been a bunch of studies showing that it can be pretty good for treating different health issues, including stuff like depression, anxiety, sleep problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, and"
"I've been using some herbal remedies for my sinus issues, should I tell my doctor about this before having surgery?","Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) includes treatments from  traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbal medicine,  Ayurvedic medicine, mind-body medicine, chiropractic or osteopathic  manipulations, and massage. More than 40% of patients in the United States use  CAM, with 17% of CAM use related to otolaryngology diagnoses, but nearly half of  CAM users do not communicate their use of these medications to their physicians.  Perioperative risk of bleeding is a particular concern in surgical specialties,  and knowledge of these therapies and their potential adverse effects is  critical.","According to 'The role of alternative medicine in rhinology', a lot of people in the US use alternative treatments like traditional Chinese medicine, yoga, herbal remedies, and massage therapy. About 17% of these treatments are used for ear, nose and throat issues. However, nearly half of these people don't tell their doctors they're using these treatments. This can be risky, especially if you're having surgery, because some of these treatments can cause issues like bleeding. So, it's super important to let your doctor know if you're using any of these alternative treatments."
Are there any natural remedies or plants from India that I could use to help heal cuts and wounds faster?,"India has a rich tradition of plant-based knowledge on healthcare. A large  number of plants/plant extracts/decoctions or pastes are equally used by tribals  and folklore traditions in India for treatment of cuts, wounds, and burns. The  present review thus attempts to analyze the ethnobotanical knowledge base for  treatment of cuts and wounds which includes a usage of plants, methods employed  by tribals and folklore practices prevailing in India. Pharmacological reports  available on Indian medicinal plants employing various wound healing models and  its underlying molecular mechanism, wherever available, has also been briefly  reviewed. This pharmacological validation on Indian medicinal plants is very  limited and a large number of plants used in tribal and folklore with enormous  potential have not been validated for their wound healing activity. This review  therefore attempts to bridge the lacunae in the existing literature and offers  immense scope for researchers engaged in validation of the traditional claims  and development of safe and effective and globally accepted herbal drugs for  cuts and wounds.","According to 'Ethnopharmacological approaches to wound healing--exploring medicinal plants of India', India has a long history of using plants to help heal cuts and wounds. They use different parts of plants, unique methods, and traditional practices to treat these injuries. However, not a lot of research has been done to truly understand why these plants work. This paper suggests that there's a lot of potential to learn more about these plants and maybe even develop new, natural remedies for wounds and cuts in the future."
"So, if a family already has a girl, are they more likely to have another girl? And does taking traditional medicines actually help with choosing the baby's sex?","OBJECTIVE: Sex-ratio at birth in families with previous girls is worse than  those with a boy. Our aim was to prospectively study in a large maternal and  child unit sex-ratio against previous birth sex and use of traditional medicines  for sex selection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sex-ratio among mothers in families with a previous girl  and in those with a previous boy, prevalence of indigenous medicine use and  sex-ratio in those using medicines for sex selection. RESULTS: Overall there were 806 girls to 1000 boys. The sex-ratio was 720:1000  if there was one previous girl and 178:1000 if there were two previous girls. In  second children of families with a previous boy 1017 girls were born per 1000  boys. Sex-ratio in those with one previous girl, who were taking traditional  medicines for sex selection, was 928:1000. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the second children clearly shows the sex-ratio is  being manipulated by human interventions. More mothers with previous girls tend  to use traditional medicines for sex selection, in their subsequent pregnancies.  Those taking such medication do not seem to be helped according to expectations.  They seem to rely on this method and so are less likely use more definitive  methods like sex selective abortions. This is the first such prospective  investigation of sex ratio in second children looked at against the sex of  previous children. More studies are needed to confirm the findings.","According to 'Sex ratio at birth in India, its relation to birth order, sex of previous children and use of indigenous medicine,' the chances of having a baby boy or girl aren't always 50/50. This study found that if a family already has a girl, they're more likely to have a boy next time. Also, it seems like some moms who already have girls try to use traditional medicines to increase their chances of having a boy. But the study found that these medicines don't really work as expected. This is a new area of research, so more studies are needed to understand what's going on."
"I've been feeling really down lately, could Ayurvedic methods help balance my mood?","The appropriation of biopsychiatric concepts such as depression, and their  reframing in clinical and academic discussions, are important parts of the  revitalization of bhūt vidyā as Ayurvedic psychiatry. Drawing on ethnographic  fieldwork conducted in Kerala from 2009 to 2011, in this article we explore the  process and the controversies of translating and correlating the biopsychiatric  notion of depression, as a discrete and biologic pathological entity, with  Ayurvedic notions of body, mind, and mental distress. Depression, conceptualized  as a neurochemical imbalance, is, we argue, relatively compatible with Ayurvedic  notions of a fluent body and mind, and so is easier to correlate with Ayurvedic  concepts of do[Formula: see text]ic imbalances and blockages of channels than  the former psychoanalytically dominated model of depression. The appropriation  of depression within Ayurvedic discourse challenges the dichotomy of universal  and culture-specific disorders, and this has a significant impact on mental  health programs in Kerala.","According to 'Appropriating depression: biomedicalizing Ayurvedic psychiatry in Kerala, India', traditional Ayurvedic medicine in India is starting to incorporate modern ideas about depression into its approach. The study, conducted in Kerala between 2009 and 2011, found that the Ayurvedic understanding of depression as an imbalance in the body and mind actually aligns pretty well with the scientific view of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain. This blending of old and new concepts could challenge the way we think about mental health and lead to new treatments."
"Why do some people believe that ""carelessness"" or ""superstition"" can lead to poor health? And how does education factor into this?","Professional and lay explanations of disability, collected via interviews and  participant-observation during fieldwork in Hyderabad, South India, identify  ""carelessness"" and ""superstition"" as major impediments to good health among the  general population, and education as the key solution. In that such findings  suggest a valorization of personal responsibility for self-care, the Foucauldian  concept of biopower appeared a salient framework for analysis. Although  illuminating, however, biopower was ultimately inadequate for explaining what  emerged, on closer analysis, as significant discrepancies between assumptions  about how disabled people engaged with healthcare services and their actual  beliefs and practices; and between the moral interpretations different  stakeholders made of ""carelessness"" in describing perceived causes of  disability. My data also suggested that education was not in itself a key  determinant in people's healthcare decisions. This article explores these  differences between official and demotic discourses concerning the causes of  disability and attempts to account for them ethnographically.","According to 'Culture and carelessness: constituting disability in South India', people often blame ""carelessness"" and ""superstition"" for poor health and disabilities in South India. They think education is the main solution. But the study found out that it's not that simple. The way people think about health and disability can be different from how it really works. For instance, even though education is important, it's not the only thing that influences how people make decisions about their health. Also, what some people might call ""carelessness"" can be understood differently by others. It's a complex issue with no easy answers."
I've heard that some herbs can help with brain health. Is there anything natural I could take to help prevent Alzheimer's or other memory issues?,"Ayurveda is the medicinal science, dealing with utilization of naturally  available plant products for treatment. A wide variety of neuroprotective herbs  have been reported in Ayurveda. Brahmi, Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic ayurvedic  herb known to be effective in neurological disorders from ancient times.  Numerous approaches including natural and synthetic compounds have been applied  against Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β and Tau are the hallmarks proteins of  several neuronal dysfunctions resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Tau is a  microtubule-associated protein known to be involved in progression of  Alzheimer's disease. The generation of reaction oxygen species, increased  neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity are the major physiological dysfunctions  associated with Tau aggregates, which leads to dementia and behavioural  deficits. Bacoside A, Bacoside B, Bacosaponins, Betulinic acid, etc; are the  bioactive component of Brahmi belonging to various chemical families. Each  chemical component known have its significant role in neuroprotection. The  neuroprotective properties of Brahmi and its bioactive components including  reduction of ROS, neuroinflammation, aggregation inhibition of Amyloid-β and  improvement of cognitive and learning behaviour. Here on basis of earlier  studies we hypothesize the inhibitory role of Brahmi against Tau-mediated  toxicity. The overall studies have concluded that Brahmi can be used as a lead  formulation for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological  disorders.","According to 'Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri): An ayurvedic herb against the Alzheimer's disease', Brahmi is a plant that's been used in traditional medicine for ages, and recent studies suggest it could be useful in treating Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is triggered by certain proteins that mess up how your brain cells work, leading to memory loss and other issues. Brahmi has active components that seem to protect the brain, reducing harmful reactions, inflammation, and even improving learning and memory. So, Brahmi might be a natural way to help tackle Alzheimer's and other brain disorders."
"I've been using a lot of Ayurvedic remedies lately, should I be worried about heavy metals or something in them?","The quality and safety of Ayurvedic formulations has become a serious issue, as  this Indian system of medicine is used by 80% of the Indian population. Hence,  the present study was performed to evaluate heavy metals contents by flame  atomic absorbance spectroscopy (AAS) measurements and confirmation by inductive  coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). A total of 78 formulations (56  herbal, 19 herbometallic and 3 metallic) were sampled. In herbal formulations,  lead in 19.6% (11/56), cadmium in 21.4% (12/56), mercury and arsenic in 5.3%  (3/56) were above the limit. Lead in 52.6% (10/19) of samples, cadmium in 26.3%  (5/19) and mercury and arsenic contained in one herbometallic sample was above  the limit. Heavy metals in all metal formulations were above the WHO limit.  Significant batch variation was observed. The analytical results of flame AAS  and ICP-MS did not differ significantly in the range of measurements in this  study, which proves that both methods are satisfactory for estimation of heavy  metals in these type of samples.","According to 'Monitoring of mercury, arsenic, cadmium and lead in Ayurvedic formulations marketed in Delhi by flame AAS and confirmation by ICP-MS', a lot of Ayurvedic medicines in India have been found to have unsafe levels of heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic. This is a big deal because most people in India use these medicines. The levels were especially high in medicines that had metal in them. So, you might want to be careful and check the safety of these products before using them."
My grandma has started losing her hearing and she also complains about constant ringing in her ears. Is there any natural treatment that can help with her condition?,"BACKGROUND: Presbycusis is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both  ears at high frequencies, which affects more than half of the older adults by  the age of 75 years and is often accompanied by tinnitus and cognitive  deterioration. Unfortunately, there are no treatments available to restore  hearing loss. Treatment mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and  communication with hearing aids. Traditional medicine like Ayurveda also  explains ailments of a similar nature as Badhirya and advises using drugs with  antiaging and neuroprotective activity for treatment. In Ayurveda, Badhirya and  Karnanada (senile deafness with tinnitus) are due to vitiation of Vata Dosha.  Treatments such as topical oil pooling (Karnapurana) are usually advised to  counter Vata, improve hearing capacity, and reduce tinnitus. Kshirabala Taila, a  medicated oil formulation prepared with Sida cordifolia Linnaeus, is one of the  most preferred oils for topical oil pooling in such conditions, as it has a  definitive indication for sensory dysfunctions. Drugs like Withania somnifera  (L.) Dunal (Ashwagandha) are also used, as they ameliorate neurodegeneration and  help to improve cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: We propose an exploratory randomized controlled trial study for  evaluating the efficacy of TOPMAC (Topical Oil Pooling with Kshirabala Taila and  Supplementation of Ashwagandha Churna) in tinnitus suppression and hearing and  cognitive function protection in patients aged 60-75 years with mild to moderate  presbycusis. METHODS: A parallel, 2-group, exploratory randomized controlled trial will be  conducted in an Indian Ayurvedic research center at its outpatient service.  Participants (N=60) with mild to moderate presbycusis will be recruited by  screening. Participants will be randomized (computer-generated 1:1) to receive  either basic treatment and health education (BTHE) or BTHE+TOPMAC for 24 weeks.  The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in  the protection of hearing function. The secondary objective is to compare the  efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in tinnitus suppression and cognitive  function protection. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2023. The institutional ethics  committees at National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma  (3/1/2020/NARIP/Tech/2036) and Institute for Communicative and Cognitive Neuro  Sciences (IEC006) approved this study. The first patient was enrolled in  September 2023; 22 participants were enrolled as of August 2024. The data  analysis is yet to start, and the results are expected to be published by  January 2025. CONCLUSIONS: If this exploratory trial is proven effective, it will steer the  setting of a definitive randomized controlled trial to test whether the TOPMAC  intervention can be incorporated as a cost-effective integrative approach for  managing presbycusis. The Indian government has already launched a National  Program for Prevention and Control of Deafness to benefit the deaf population.  TOPMAC may later be considered for integration with the national program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials Registry India CTRI/2023/04/051485;  https://tinyurl.com/2h2hry3n.

I've heard about traditional medicine and I'm curious. How can it be beneficial to my health and where can I find good quality medicinal plants in my area?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sri Lanka has rich traditional systems of  medicine, which cater to 60-70% of the rural population׳s primary health care  needs. However, development of existing systems has been hindered by the  unavailability of up-to-date information on medicinal materials and other  related issues. For streamlining purposes, we investigated the present-day  scenario of country׳s medicinal plant industry by gathering up-to-date  information on the types of raw materials required, their aggregate quantities,  heavily used and rare materials, family wise distribution, challenges faced by  stakeholders as well as other pertinent issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present survey covered the selected government  Ayurveda hospitals, traditional and Ayurveda practitioners, large and  small-scale herbal drug and cosmetic manufactures, importers, collectors and  Ayurveda commissioners throughout the country. A systematic questionnaire was  distributed and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Collected data were  tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: A diverse range of medicinal materials, including 290 species (64.73%)  from dried plants, 59 (13.17%) from fresh plants, 69 (15.40%) from minerals, 18  (4.02%) from animal sources and 12 (2.68%) from other sources were recorded. A  total of 302 plant species belonging to 95 families, dominated by Leguminosae  family, was listed. Out of these, 46 species belonging to 35 families were used  intensively. A large portion of herbal materials was of completely local origin  (71.13%) while 26% were imported and the rest (2.87%) can be obtained by both  routes. Leaves were the most highly used part of the plant (22.2%). High price,  poor quality, insufficient or totally absence of continuous supply and  adulteration were the main constraints faced by the stakeholders. The  unavailability of systematic cultivation and processing protocols, incorrect  identification, and lack of proper quality control methodologies were identified  as major challenges of the industry. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a currently bleak scenario of the  medicinal material industry in Sri Lanka. The results clearly demonstrated the  need to implement a national strategy to address the major challenges faced by  different stakeholders. Information generated through this study could be  effectively incorporated for the formulation of a sustainable development  strategy for this industry.","According to the research paper 'A survey on medicinal materials used in traditional systems of medicine in Sri Lanka', Sri Lanka has a rich history of using traditional medicine. The majority of people in rural areas still use this kind of medicine for their primary health care. However, the industry is facing some issues, like not having enough information about the medicinal plants and materials they use.

The research found that a wide variety of materials are used in this traditional medicine, from dried and fresh plants to minerals and even some animal sources. However, there are some problems. For example, some materials are too expensive, the quality isn't always great, and sometimes they run out of certain materials completely. Plus, some materials aren't properly identified or quality checked.

"I've been dealing with some stomach issues lately, like ulcers. Do you think this herb called Satavari Mandur could help?","Satavari mandur (SM) is a herbo-mineral preparation containing Asparagus  racemosus, which finds mention in ancient Indian texts for treatment of gastric  ulcers. The ulcer protective effect of SM, 125-500 mg/kg given orally, twice  daily for three, five and seven days, was studied on cold restraint  stress-induced gastric ulcer in rats. The effective regimen was found to be 250  mg/kg given for five days and hence was used for further experiments. SM showed  significant protection against acute gastric ulcers induced by pyloric ligation  but was ineffective against aspirin- and ethanol-induced ulcers. Further,  gastric juice studies showed that, SM significantly increased the mucosal  defensive factors like mucus secretion, but had little or no effect on offensive  factors like acid and pepsin secretion.","According to 'Antiulcerogenic activity of Satavari mandur--an Ayurvedic herbo-mineral preparation', Satavari mandur, a herbal mix that includes asparagus, can help protect against certain types of stomach ulcers. If taken orally for five days, it can help increase your stomach's defenses like mucus secretion. However, it's not effective against ulcers caused by aspirin or alcohol. So, it might be a good remedy if you're dealing with this type of stomach issue, but not a cure-all for every type of ulcer."
"I've been hearing a lot about this thing called panchakola, is it really that good for fighting off diseases and keeping you healthy?","A large number of studies have proven the efficacy of ayurveda in the field of  health and wellness. Panchakola, an ayurvedic formulation, is a general health  tonic primarily used to cure fever, inflammation, pain, indigestion, and so on.  We investigated effects of panchakola on oxidative stress in MCF-7 breast cancer  and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. This work was performed to assess  the antineoplastic and free radical-scavenging potential of aqueous extract of  panchakola, a polyherbal formulation, in normal and breast cancer cell lines  (i.e., HEK and MCF-7, respectively) using MTT assay. Activities of antioxidant  enzyme, nitric oxide scavenger, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase,  and glutathione peroxidase were assessed in cell lines incubated with and  without panchakola. The outcome was analyzed by spectrophotometer. The results  demonstrated increased cytotoxicity in MCF-7 (IC50 16.446 μg/ml) comparable to  the results obtained with standard anticancer control (curcumin) with IC50  10.265 μg/ml in MCF-7 cell line. Further, the results obtained from antioxidant  assays suggested increased antioxidant activity in MCF-7 cells as compared to  normal HEK cells. The results derived from this study suggested panchakola is a  strong contender in the field of phytomedicines to fight cancer and free  radical-related diseases.","According to 'Panchakola Reduces Oxidative Stress in MCF-7 Breast Cancer and HEK293 Cells', Panchakola, an Ayurvedic mix of herbs, could potentially be a powerful tool in the fight against cancer and diseases caused by harmful free radicals. The study found that Panchakola, when tested on breast cancer cells, demonstrated similar effects to a well-known cancer-fighting substance, curcumin. Plus, it seemed to boost the antioxidant activity in these cells, which is a good thing as antioxidants help protect our bodies from damage. This suggests that Panchakola might be worth looking into if you're into natural health remedies and preventative measures."
I've heard that some plants can help prevent cancer. Is there any truth to this?,"Withaferin A (hereafter abbreviated as WA) is a promising anticancer steroidal  lactone abundant in a medicinal plant (Withania somnifera) native to Asia. The  root/leaf extract of Withania somnifera, which belongs to the Solanaceae family,  continues to be included in the Ayurvedic medicine formulations of alternative  medicine practice. Numerous chemicals are detectable in the root/leaf extract of  Withania somnifera [e.g., withanolides (WA, withanone, withanolide A, etc.),  alkaloids, sitoindosides, etc.], but the anticancer effect of this medicinal  plant is largely attributed to WA. Anticancer effect of WA was initially  reported in the early 70s in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell model in vitro Since  then, numerous preclinical studies have been performed using cellular and animal  models of different cancers including breast cancer to determine cancer  therapeutic and chemopreventive effects of WA. Chemoprevention, a word first  introduced by Dr. Michael B. Sporn, was intended to impede, arrest, or reverse  carcinogenesis at its earliest stages with pharmacologic agents. This review  succinctly summarizes the published findings on anticancer pharmacology of WA in  breast cancer focusing on pharmacokinetic behavior, in vivo efficacy data in  preclinical models in a therapeutic and chemoprevention settings, and its known  effects on cancer-relevant cellular processes (e.g., growth arrest, apoptosis  induction, autophagy, metabolic adaptation, immune function, etc.) and molecular  targets (e.g., suppression of oncogenes such as estrogen receptor-α, STAT3,  etc.). Potential gaps in knowledge as well as future research directions  essential for clinical development of WA for chemoprevention and/or treatment of  breast cancer are also discussed.","According to 'A Comprehensive Review and Perspective on Anticancer Mechanisms of Withaferin A in Breast Cancer', there's a plant called Withania somnifera that's often used in alternative medicine and it has a chemical in it called Withaferin A (or WA for short). This chemical could be a game-changer in fighting cancer, especially breast cancer. It not only helps to stop cancer cells from growing, but it can also help prevent cancer from developing in the first place. Scientists are still studying how it works and how they can use it in cancer treatments, but it's looking promising!"
I've been feeling stressed and catching colds a lot lately. Are there any natural remedies that could boost my immune system?,"BACKGROUND: Constant exposure to various stressors, such as immune pressure,  rapidly increasing population, deleterious changes in the ecosystem, climate  change, infection with emerging and re-emerging pathogens, and fast-paced  lifestyle, is a critical factor in the globally increasing incidences of  immunocompromising health conditions, as well as stress. Synthetic  chemotherapeutic agents, which are widely available in the commercial market,  may be highly efficacious, but most are immunosuppressive and exert many side  effects. METHODS: Herein, we comprehensively reviewed current literature from various  scientific databases such as Bentham Science, PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier,  Springer, etc. The inclusion/exclusion criteria based on literature with high  importance was adopted to analyze and compile salient information from the  authentic bibliographic sources. RESULTS: Undoubtedly, the pivotal characteristics of immunostimulants and  immunomodulators in the maintenance of the health and productivity of humans, as  well as animals, cannot be overlooked. Numerous herbs used in ethnoveterinary  medicine can be successfully employed as adjuvant rehabilitators to negate the  deleterious effects of chemotherapeutics. The sources of these medicinal  remedies are part of long traditions in different regions of the world, such as  Indian Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, which have been developed  through empirical experience. Traditional medicine employs a holistic approach  to the prevention of disease, and traditional herbal medicines are a source of  many components with a high therapeutic value that are used in modern allopathic  medicine. Globally, many studies have been conducted on these herbs and have  revealed unique active constituents that activate the innate immune system  through the stimulation of macrophages and lymphocytes, and modulation of the  cytokine profile, which leads to a state of alertness with a subsequent  reduction in the incidence of infection. Immunomodulatory constituents with  herbal origins are termed as phytochemicals, including flavonoids, glycosides,  polysaccharides, terpenoids, essential oils, various bitters, and alkaloids; all  these compounds exert vital, multidimensional effects. Efforts have focused on  screening plant preparations to identify adjuvant immune properties;  furthermore, several potent phytol adjuvants have been experimentally proven to  downregulate inflammatory reactions in addition to enhance specific adaptive  responses to vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this review summarizes the current status and future  prospects regarding the immunomodulatory potential of various herbs and plants  and their promising utility for designing and developing effective drugs and  medicines in safeguarding the health of humans, animals, and poultry.","According to 'Herbal Immunomodulators - A Remedial Panacea for Designing and Developing Effective Drugs and Medicines: Current Scenario and Future Prospects', there's a lot of stressors in our world today like climate change, fast-paced lifestyles and new diseases that put our immune system under a lot of pressure. A lot of drugs that we use to treat these conditions can have side effects and can even lower our immune system function. However, the paper suggests that traditional medicine, such as Indian Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine, can offer alternative solutions. These methods use herbs and plants that have been found to boost our immune system, help our bodies to fight off infection, and even lessen inflammation. So, it might be worth looking into"
My grandma has arthritis and she struggles a lot with joint pain. Are there any natural remedies or plants that could help her out?,"Chronic joint inflammatory disorders like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis, which are manifested by joint dysfunction, show an upsurge in  inflammation and oxidative stress. Although conventional anti-arthritic drugs  are being used to relieve pain from arthritic symptoms, they usually cause  severe side effects. Traditionally used Ayurvedic medicinal plants are a  promising alternative for the management of arthritic symptoms, as they are safe  and effective. Ayurvedic medicinal plants improve arthritic symptoms by reducing  joint tenderness, joint pain, swelling, bone and cartilage damage, and  increasing knee flexion, walking distance and sports activities. These  beneficial effects of Ayurvedic medicinal plants on arthritis are mediated  through various cellular mechanisms including inhibition of the inflammatory  markers NF-κB, cytokines, adipokines, PGE2, NO, iNOS, COX-2, and MMPs and  induction of antioxidant status by decreasing free radicals, lipid peroxidation,  and myeloperoxidase, and increasing antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2, and HO-1. Thus, a  strategy requires using these Ayurvedic medicinal plants to treat arthritis.  This article describes the status of inflammation and oxidative stress in  arthritic conditions. We also provide evidence that Ayurvedic medicinal plants  and their bioactive components are highly effective in improving arthritic  symptoms.","According to 'Inflammation and ROS in arthritis: management by Ayurvedic medicinal plants', arthritis, which is when your joints get inflamed and cause a lot of pain, can be managed by traditional Ayurvedic plants. These plants can help reduce the pain, swelling and other symptoms of arthritis, and they don't have the severe side effects that normal arthritis drugs do. These plants work by reducing inflammation and stress in the body. So, using Ayurvedic medicinal plants could be a good strategy to deal with arthritis."
I've been hearing a lot about this Triphala stuff in Ayurveda. Can it really help prevent cancer and how does it work?,"BACKGROUND: Triphala (Sanskrit tri = three and phala = fruits), composed of the  three medicinal fruits Phyllanthus emblica L. or Emblica officinalis Gaertn.,  Terminalia chebula Retz., and Terminalia belerica Retz. is an important herbal  preparation in the traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda. Triphala is  an antioxidant-rich herbal formulation and possesses diverse beneficial  properties. It is a widely prescribed Ayurvedic drug and is used as a colon  cleanser, digestive, diuretic, and laxative. Cancer is a major cause of death,  and globally studies are being conducted to prevent cancer or to develop  effective nontoxic therapeutic agents. Experimental studies in the past decade  have shown that Triphala is useful in the prevention of cancer and that it also  possesses antineoplastic, radioprotective and chemoprotective effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review for the first time summarizes these results, with  emphasis on published observations. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms  responsible for the beneficial effects and lacunas in the existing knowledge  that need to be bridged are also discussed.","According to 'Triphala, Ayurvedic formulation for treating and preventing cancer: a review', Triphala is a mix of three fruits that's often used in Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine. Not only is it loaded with antioxidants and good for digestion, but studies over the last ten years also suggest that it could help prevent cancer. However, there's still a lot we don't know about how it works, and more research is needed."
"I've heard about this plant called Adhatoda vasica being used in herbal medicine. Is it actually safe to use, especially for breathing problems?","Adhatoda vasica (L.) Nees is a well-known plant drug in Ayurvedic and Unani  medicine. It has been used for the treatment of various diseases and disorders,  particularly for the respiratory tract ailments. During the last 20 years,  several scientific reports on oxytocic and abortifacient effects of vasicine and  alkaloid derived from the plant have appeared. This leads to questions  concerning the safety of A. vasica as a herbal medicine. In this article, the  major data on traditional uses as well as ethnopharmacological and toxicological  studies, both published and unpublished, are reviewed and commented upon. The  data have been evaluated from the point of view of correctness, reliability,  relevance and importance for the overall evaluation of the safety of A. vasica.","According to 'Adhatoda vasica: a critical review of ethnopharmacological and toxicological data', Adhatoda vasica is a plant that's been used in traditional medicine, especially for respiratory issues. However, recent studies have shown that it might also cause contractions during pregnancy and potentially lead to miscarriages. So, while it's been used for a long time and can help with some health problems, it's not necessarily safe for everyone, especially for pregnant women."
"I've been having some toothaches and gum problems, do you think Ayurvedic treatments could help with my oral health issues?","BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, an ancient medical science originating in India, also is  practiced in the United States. The authors conducted a study primarily to  explore the involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in treating oral diseases. METHODS: Eighty-five practitioners participated in this cross-sectional survey.  The authors obtained self-reported data on demographics of the practitioners,  the general and oral health conditions they treated, and the treatment  modalities used. They performed descriptive statistical and logistic regression  analyses by using statistical software. RESULTS: Participants predominantly were female and white or non-Hispanic, as  well as part-time practitioners. Their educational backgrounds ranged from a  5½-year bachelor's degree in Ayurveda to short-term training. Of the 60  respondents who answered the question about treating oral diseases, 25 (42  percent) reported that they did so. Conditions treated were related to oral  malodor, gingival or periodontal disease and toothache. Ayurvedic treatments  administered for these conditions primarily were preventive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic practitioners in the United States treat a variety of  oral diseases by using predominantly preventive traditional care. Ayurvedic  practitioners of Asian origin and those who practiced for a longer duration were  more likely to report that they treated oral diseases. Larger, population-based  studies are needed to understand more fully the current role of Ayurvedic  practitioners in oral health care. Ayurvedic treatment modalities aimed at oral  diseases need to be evaluated through rigorous randomized controlled trials for  safety and effectiveness. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients with limited or no access to oral health care  might seek Ayurvedic treatment, and those who have access to conventional oral  health care might wish to complement it with Ayurvedic treatment. Practitioners  can incorporate preventive Ayurvedic treatments, which are based mainly on  natural products, into overall preventive care regimens, if proven safe and  effective.","According to 'Involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in oral health care in the United States', Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, is being used in the U.S. to help with oral health problems. In a survey of 85 Ayurvedic practitioners, about 42% said they treat issues like bad breath, gum disease, and toothaches. Most of these treatments aim to prevent these issues from happening in the first place. The study found that practitioners with Asian origins or those who have been practicing for a long time were more likely to treat oral diseases. So, if you're having trouble accessing regular dental care, or just want to add something extra to your oral health routine, Ayurvedic treatments could be something"
"I've been feeling super stressed and anxious lately, is there a natural remedy that could help me chill out and maybe even help with my headaches?","'Unmadnashak Ghrita' (UG) is a ayurvedic formulation containing Ferula narthex  (6 g), Gardenia gummifera (6 g), Ellataria cardamom (6 g), Bacopa monneri (6 g),  and cow's ghee (clarified butter fat) (76 g). In the present study,  neuropharmacological activities of UG were evaluated for its gross behavioural  effect, pentobarbitone sleeping time, spontaneous locomotor activity, antagonism  to amphetamine induced hyperlocomotor activity, analgesic activity by tail flick  test, rota-rod performance (motor coordination test), maximal electroshock (MES)  induced seizures, and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced convulsions in mice. The  formulation showed CNS-depressant activity in gross behavioural test,  potentiated pentobarbitone sleeping time and there was significant decrease in  spontaneous locomotor count in mice. The formulation also antagonized the  behavioral effects of CNS-stimulant drug amphetamine, and showed analgesic  effect in mice. UG failed to affect the motor coordination test. The formulation  also protected mice from MES and PTZ induced convulsions. These results suggest  that UG has CNS-depressant and anticonvulsant activity in mice.","According to 'Evaluation of sedative and anticonvulsant activities of Unmadnashak Ghrita', Unmadnashak Ghrita (UG) is a mix of different herbs and cow's ghee, sort of like a natural remedy from Ayurveda. The study found that it seems to calm the central nervous system (that's your brain and spinal cord), help mice sleep better, and reduce how much they move around. It even helped counteract the effects of a drug that usually makes mice super active. Plus, it seemed to work as a painkiller, and it protected mice from seizures. But it didn't mess with their motor skills, so they could still move around normally. So, this UG stuff might"
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic treatments lately. Do they actually work for conditions like jaundice?,"This paper describes beliefs and practices associated with jaundice and its  treatment by ayurvedic physicians (vaidyas) in Kathmandu. It documents  continuity of ancient ayurvedic ideas and practices as well as syncretism  between ayurvedic and allopathic (Western, biomedical) traditions in modern  Nepal. Popular beliefs about the cause of jaundice appear to have evolved to fit  therapeutic practices adopted by vaidyas from allopathy. An implication of this  finding is that beliefs about causation do not necessarily precede and channel  therapeutic choices; they may also function to rationalize and provide meaning  to experiences of illness and therapy. The data also suggest a number of  hypotheses about the efficacy of ayurvedic treatment for jaundice.","According to 'Ayurvedic treatment for jaundice in Nepal', traditional healers in Kathmandu use a blend of ancient Ayurvedic methods and modern Western medicine to treat jaundice. People's beliefs about what causes jaundice have changed over time to match the treatments these healers use. This suggests that our understanding of a disease can be shaped by the treatments available, not just the other way around. The researchers also think that Ayurvedic treatment might be effective for jaundice, but more studies are needed to be sure."
"I've been thinking about trying out some traditional medicines and supplements, but I heard they might have some harmful stuff like metals in them. Is that true?","Traditional medicine (TM) including Ayurvedic medicines, traditional Chinese  medicines and nutraceuticals are popular across the globe as dietary supplements  and traditional and alternative medicines. Health risks from these remedies  continue to present serious concerns, with occurrences of poisoning by metals  and metalloids present at concentrations above acceptable regulatory standards.  This review overviews the prevalence of TM use, cases of metal and metalloid  poisoning following TM consumption, and forms of TM contamination and  adulteration. The review summarises regulations by the World Health Organization  (WHO) and other relevant bodies. Finally, the review recommends how to protect  consumers.","According to 'Metals and metalloids in traditional medicines (Ayurvedic medicines, nutraceuticals and traditional Chinese medicines)', even though traditional medicines like Ayurvedic and Chinese medicines are popular worldwide, they could pose some health risks. The risk comes from the fact that sometimes these medicines have metals in them at levels higher than what's considered safe. It's like when you have too much of something that's usually okay - it can become harmful. There have been cases where people got poisoned from these metals after taking the medicine. It's important to be aware of this and make sure you're getting your medicines from a reliable source. Some organizations, like the World Health Organization, have rules to help keep these medicines safe. The paper suggests"
I've been hearing a lot about this Ayurveda stuff lately. Can something like that actually help with weight loss and my sugar cravings?,"BACKGROUND: Panchakarma (biopurification methods) is one of the modes of  ayurveda to treat disorders of the body. Virechana karma (therapeutic  purgation), one among the Panchakarma, is a purification process that is  commonly used to treat metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes mellitus.  Hence this study was planned to provide evidence through animal experiments. METHODS: Albino rats were subject to Virechana karma (therapeutic purgation) to  evaluate the influence of therapy and its mechanism over fructose-induced  metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Results show that Virechana is effective in the management of the  metabolic syndrome with decrease in the fecal fat content, fasting blood  glucose, serum triglyceride, and reduced fatty changes in liver, heart, and  kidney in comparison with the positive control group. CONCLUSION: Experimental evaluation showed decrease in fatty acid in the storage  like liver, kidney, heart, and muscle adipose tissue can indirectly increase the  insulin sensitivity in insulin receptor present at skeletal muscles.","According to 'Effect and Mechanism of Virechana Karma (Therapeutic Purgation) Over Fructose-Induced Metabolic Syndrome: An Experimental Study', using a method from Ayurveda called Virechana Karma, which is basically a deep cleanse, can help reduce symptoms of metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes. This cleanse seems to work by reducing levels of fat and sugar in the blood, and decreasing fat in the liver, heart, and kidneys. This could even improve how your body responds to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. So, if you're dealing with issues like these, it might be worth looking into Ayurveda treatments for a natural approach."
I'm trying to lose some weight and I've heard about this thing called Guggulu. Does it really help if I add it to my diet and exercise routine?,"An open comparative trial was conducted in 58 adult obese patients (Body Mass  Index > or = 25 kg/square metre). Group I (n = 27), non-drug, was advised diet  (1200-1600 cals) and a brisk walk for 30 minutes. Group II, in addition,  received Guggulu (Medohar) 1.5-3 gms/day for 30 days. Mean difference in weight  loss between Guggulu and non-drug group was 0.32 kg (ns) on day 15 and 0.58 kg  on day 30 (ns). The mean weight reduction in patients (> 90 kgs) was 1.92 kg  (ns) and 2.25 kg (ns) higher in Guggulu group. All patients weighing > 90 kg  lost weight in Guggulu group whilst 3 in non-drug group did not lose weight.  Guggulu was tolerated well. The data from this pilot study suggest a synergistic  diet-Guggulu interaction over 30 days in patients weighing > 90 kgs which needs  to be confirmed in a large placebo controlled study.","According to 'Conceptual and methodologic challenges of assessing the short-term efficacy of Guggulu in obesity: data emergent from a naturalistic clinical trial', a study was done on overweight adults to see if a supplement called Guggulu can help with weight loss. They split the participants into two groups. One group just ate a restricted diet and did some walking, while the other group did the same but also took Guggulu. After a month, the people taking Guggulu didn't lose significantly more weight than the non-pill group, but if you were over 200 lbs, the Guggulu seemed to help more. Everyone in the heavy group who took Guggulu lost some weight, but in the non-pill group, a"
"So, how does India juggle all these different types of traditional and modern medical practices?","The paper explicates ""practiced medicine"" as an operative cross-cultural  analytic concept by locating it within previous major developments and  directions of study within anthropological studies of medicine in India, and  medical anthropology more generally. Practiced medicine in India, for example,  allows us to see better how India manages not only multiple traditional and  modern medical approaches, languages, therapeutic regimens, and materia medica,  but it also leads us to a sustained moral, social and material criticism from  within. The study of such diversity leads to a loosely shared, and  ethnographically attestable, cultural reasoning, practice and practical ethos  across the traditional and modern medical worlds. Also appearing before us are  the usually hidden cultural assumptions, negotiations and compromises of diverse  Indian medical practitioners, and the strengths and weaknesses of modern  medicine under ""normal"" and ""disastrous"" situations in contemporary India. As  India today grapples with issues of availability, affordability, equity, and  distributive justice in medical care, its practiced medicine raises issues of  ""critical consciousness"" for modern (and traditional), state supported medicine.","According to 'Dava, Daktar, and Dua: anthropology of practiced medicine in India', the way medicine is practiced in India is unique because it combines traditional and modern medical practices. It's like having a recipe that includes both grandma's old-school cooking techniques and the latest food trends. This study also highlights how the system is not perfect and faces challenges like making healthcare affordable and accessible to everyone. It's like having a gym membership but not being able to go because it's too far or too expensive. This practice in India encourages us to be more aware and critical about the healthcare system, not just in India, but around the world."
"I seem to catch colds really easily, could drinking a special type of tea help boost my immune system?","The effect of a tea fortified with five herbs selected from Indian traditional  medicine (Ayurveda) for their putative immunoenhancing effect (Withania  somnifera, Glycyrrhzia glabra, Zingiber officinale, Ocimum sanctum and Elettaria  cardamomum) on innate immunity was investigated. Ex vivo natural killer (NK)  cell activity was assessed after consumption of fortified tea compared with  regular tea in two independent double-blind intervention studies. Both studies  were conducted in India with healthy volunteers (age >or= 55 years) selected for  a relatively low baseline NK cell activity and a history of recurrent coughs and  colds. In a pilot study conducted with 32 volunteers, the consumption of Natural  Care tea significantly improved the NK cell activity of the volunteers in  comparison with a population consuming regular tea. These results were validated  in an independent crossover study with 110 volunteers. Data from these two  studies indicate that regular consumption of the tea fortified with Ayurvedic  herbs enhanced NK cell activity, which is an important aspect of the (early)  innate immune response to infections.","According to 'In vivo enhancement of natural killer cell activity through tea fortified with Ayurvedic herbs', drinking a special tea with five Indian herbs can boost your immune system and help you fight off colds and coughs better. This tea was tested on people who often got sick and it significantly improved their natural defense system, compared to drinking regular tea. So, if you find yourself catching colds quite often, you might want to try switching your regular tea for something with these Ayurvedic herbs."
I've heard about this iron ash thing from Ayurveda and how it can help with iron deficiency. How is it made and why is it good for me?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lauha bhasma (iron ash) is one of the iron-based  herbo-metallic preparations used in Ayurvedic medicine for treating various  ailments due to iron deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preparation of Lauha bhasma (iron ash) requires  normal purification (heat treatment in vegetable and animal products), special  purification (treatment with herbal constituents) and calcination steps aimed at  converting the raw material to a suitable therapeutic form. In this study, we  have systematically and scientifically evaluated through a series of qualitative  tests and modern analytical tools the importance of the treating media. RESULTS: Our data demonstrates that these steps are necessary to remove the  grease and scales in the raw material. While heating, microcracks appeared on  the surface of the iron, which improved the reactivity with the herbal  constituents in addition to incorporating nanostructured features. Further, the  use of plant products facilitated the removal of Fe³⁺ present in the raw  material by forming soluble complexes. The Fe²⁺ present in the raw materials  also forms an insoluble complex with the herbal constituents in the presence of  UV radiation. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data summarily suggest that the purification  steps involved in the preparation of Lauha bhasma (iron ash) are critical.","According to 'Scientific validation of the different purification steps involved in the preparation of an Indian Ayurvedic medicine, Lauha bhasma', Lauha bhasma, also known as iron ash, is a substance used in Ayurvedic medicine, mainly to help with iron deficiency. Its preparation involves a few steps that are pretty crucial. It's purified and heated with plant and animal products, then treated with herbal ingredients and finally turned into ash. This process makes sure any unnecessary stuff, like grease or scales, are removed from the raw iron. During this process, the iron also gets tiny cracks which help it react better with the herbal ingredients. Plus, using plant products helps remove certain types of iron from the raw material. All these steps"
"I've been taking some herbal supplements for my joint pain, but I've started to have this weird cough and I feel out of breath a lot. Could the supplements be causing this?","A middle-aged Indian woman with knee pain had consumed ayurvedic medicine  (Ostolief and Arthrella tablets) daily for 6 months. She presented to the  respiratory clinic with worsening dyspnea, cough and weight loss of 2 months'  duration. She was a homemaker, never-smoker and did not keep birds. Physical  examination detected fine end-inspiratory crackles. There was no clubbing of the  fingers, joint deformity or swelling, skin lesion or enlarged cervical  lymphadenopathy. High-resolution computed tomography showed diffuse  centrilobular nodules with ground-glass attenuation. Restrictive ventilatory  defect (FVC 44% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio 93%) was observed on spirometry, and  the autoimmune screen was negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed  lymphocytosis with an increased CD4/CD8 (T helper:T suppressor) ratio. Cultures  for bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and Pneumocystis carinii were  negative. Alveolitis with infiltration of interstitium by lymphocytes and  peribronchiolar noncaseating granulomas were observed on bronchoscopic lung  biopsy. A diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis as a result of ayurvedic  medicine was made. She was advised to stop the offending medicine; high-dose  steroids and bactrim prophylaxis were commenced and tapered over 3 months with  good response and radiological resolution. She was followed for 1 year without  relapse.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine and the lung', a woman who had been taking certain ayurvedic medicines (Ostolief and Arthrella tablets) for knee pain ended up with serious lung issues. She had to go to the doctor because she was having trouble breathing, coughing a lot, and losing weight. The doctors found out that this was because she had an allergic reaction to the medicine she was taking, which caused inflammation and damage to her lungs. She had to quit taking that medicine and start a three-month treatment with strong anti-inflammatory meds. Fortunately, she got better and didn't have any more problems for at least a year. So, it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication,"
So I've been hearing about this gold-based medicine called Suvarna Bhasma for stuff like arthritis. Is it all the same or does it matter who makes it?,"Suvarna Bhasma (SB) is a gold particle-based medicine that is used in Ayurved to  treat tuberculosis, arthritis and nervous diseases. Traditionally, the Ayurved  preparation processes of SB do exist, but they are all long, tedious and involve  several steps. Due to this, there is a possibility of bypassing the necessary  Ayurved processes or non-adherence to all steps or use of synthetic gold  particles. Our aim is to characterize 5 commercial SB preparations from 5  different manufacturers. A comparative physicochemical, pharmacokinetic (PK) and  bioaccumulation study was carried out on all the 5 SB preparations. The general  appearance such as color and texture of these 5 samples were different from each  other. The size, shape and gold concentration (from 32-98 wt%) varied among all  the 5 SBs. The accumulation of ionic gold in zebrafish and gold concentration  profiles in rat blood were found to be significantly different for all the 5  SBs. Non-compartmental PK model obtained from the concentration-time profile  showed significant differences in various PK parameters such as peak  concentration (Cmax), half-life (t1/2) and terminal elimination slope (λz) for  all the 5 SB preparations. SB-B showed the highest Cmax (8.55 μg/L), whereas  SB-D showed the lowest Cmax (4.66 μg/L). The dissolution of ionic gold from SBs  in zebrafish tissue after the oral dose had a 5.5-fold difference between the  highest and lowest ionic gold concentrations. All the 5 samples showed distinct  physicochemical and biological properties. Based on characteristic microscopic  morphology, it was found that 2 preparations among them were suspected of being  manufactured by non-adherence to the mentioned Ayurved references.","According to 'Physicochemical Variation in Nanogold-Based Ayurved Medicine Suvarna Bhasma Produced by Various Manufacturers Lead to Different In Vivo Bioaccumulation Profiles', it's kind of like when you buy a burger from five different fast food joints - they're all burgers, but they're not the same. This research is about Suvarna Bhasma, a gold-based medicine used in Ayurveda, kind of like ancient Indian medicine, to treat stuff like tuberculosis and arthritis. The process to make it is pretty complicated and so, some people might be skipping necessary steps or using fake gold. The researchers looked at five different versions of this medicine from different manufacturers and found that they all looked, acted and even 'worked' differently"
"Did ancient Sanskrit scholars know stuff about speech and language disorders, like stuttering or lisping?","This paper aims at highlighting the knowledge of the Sanskrit scholars of  ancient times in the field of speech and language pathology. The information  collected here is mainly from the Sanskrit texts written between 2000 B.C. and  1633 A.D. Some aspects of speech and language that have been dealt with in this  review have been elaborately described in the original Sanskrit texts. The  present paper, however, being limited in its scope, reviews only the essential  facts, but not the details. The purpose is only to give a glimpse of the  knowledge that the Sanskrit scholars of those times possessed. In brief, this  paper is a review of Sanskrit literature for information on the origin and  development of speech and language, speech production, normality of speech and  language, and disorders of speech and language and their treatment.","According to 'Speech pathology in ancient India--a review of Sanskrit literature', ancient Sanskrit scholars knew a lot about speech and language issues. They had knowledge about how speech and language develop, what's considered normal, and what's not. They even had ideas on how to treat speech and language disorders. This paper is like a brief look at the ancient Sanskrit texts on this topic."
Are there any common animals in India that are traditionally used for treating things like stomach aches or colds?,"The present study aims to review the zootherapeutic practices of the different  ethnic communities of India. This work is also an attempt to present a list of  animals' use for medicinal purposes by different communities of India. Data were  gathered from 15 published research papers of various authors on zootherapeutic  studies in India from 2000 to 2007. Approximately 109 animals and their 270 uses  are reported in traditional medicine in different parts of India. Of these, the  highest numbers of animal species (42, 38.5%) with 50 (18.5%) uses have been  reported for the treatment of Respiratory system related problems. Rheumatic and  other pains are treated with 32 species (29.4%) in 34 (12.9%) uses. Gastric  problems are reported to be treated with 22 (20.2%) species in 26 (9.9%) uses.  The mammals constitute the highest number of animals used for medicinal  purposes. 44 (40%) mammals, 24 (22%) invertebrates, 18 (17%) birds, 12 (11%)  reptiles, nine (8%) fishes and two (2%) amphibians have been reported for  medicinal purposes. Of the total 109 animal species reported, 76(70%) are  included in IUCN red data list and 36 (33%) animal species are listed in CITES  appendix I, II, and III. This work will be helpful in biodiversity conservation  in India and also give a clue to investigate bio-active compound in these animal  raw materials.","According to 'Traditional zootherapeutic studies in India: a review', people in India have a long history of using animals for medical treatments. This research looked at 15 different studies, which mentioned about 109 different animals and how they were used for 270 different types of treatments. The most common use was for breathing problems, with 42 different animals being used. Other common uses were for pain and stomach issues. Mammals were the most common type of animal used, followed by insects, birds, and reptiles. Interestingly, a lot of these animals are endangered or protected, which could be a problem in the future.

Are there any natural remedies or plants that could help me fight off infections or bugs?,"A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used  in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial  properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations  by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus,  Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus  aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus  niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity  against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis  of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema  ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis,  Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys  jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant  antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the  treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably  explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of  infections.","According to 'Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants', researchers checked out 61 types of medicinal plants from India to see if they could fight against bacteria and other harmful microorganisms. They found that extracts from 10 specific plants, including Jatropha gossypifolia and Cassia fistula, showed promise in battling these bugs. This could be why these plants have been traditionally used for treating different infections."
"So, I heard that roasted seeds from this tree called Artocarpus heterophyllus can mess with your sex drive. Is there any truth to that?","According to Ayurvedic literature of Sri Lanka, roasted seeds of Artocarpus  heterophyllus Lam. (Family: Moraceae) has aphrodisiac activity. However, some  reproductively active young men in rural areas of Sri Lanka claim that  consumption of these seeds few hours prior to coitus disrupts sexual function.  Because of these two conflicting claims, it was thought useful to scientifically  investigate the effects of A. heterophyllus seeds on male sexual function and  fertility. This was done using a seed suspension in 1% methylcellulose (SS) in  rats. In a sexual behaviour study using receptive female rats, an oral  administration of 500 mg/kg dose of SS markedly inhibited libido, sexual  arousal, sexual vigour and sexual performance within 2 hr. Further, the  treatment induced a mild erectile dysfunction. These antimasculine effects on  sexual function was not evident 6 hr post treatment indicating rapid onset and  offset of action. Further, these actions on the sexual behaviour was not due to  general toxicity, liver toxicity, stress or reduction in blood testosterone  level but due to marked sedative activity. In a mating study, SS failed to alter  ejaculating competence and fertility. These results suggest that A.  heterophyllous seeds do not have aphrodisiac action, at least, in rats.","According to 'Artocarpus heterophyllus seeds inhibits sexual competence but not fertility of male rats', the seeds from a type of tree called Artocarpus heterophyllus, which is also known as Jackfruit, can mess with your sex drive when eaten a few hours before getting busy. It seems to reduce feelings of arousal and can make performance a bit difficult. However, this effect seems to wear off after about 6 hours and doesn't seem to mess with your overall ability to have kids. The study found this out by testing on rats, so it's not 100% certain it would have the same effect on humans.

"So, I've been trying to lose some weight and I heard about this Ayurvedic treatment. Does it really work and is it safe to try?","Seventy obese subjects were randomised into four groups. Ayurvedic drug  treatments were given for three months while one group received a placebo.  Physical, clinical and pathological investigations were carried out at regular  intervals. A significant weight loss was observed in drug therapy groups when  compared with the placebo. Body measurements such as skin fold thickness and hip  and waist circumferences were significantly decreased. Decreases in serum  cholesterol and triglyceride levels were observed. No side effects of any kind  were observed during the treatment period.","According to 'Ayurvedic treatment of obesity: a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial', researchers tested an Ayurvedic medicine on a group of 70 overweight people. They found that the people who took the medicine for three months lost more weight than those who took a placebo. They also had smaller measurements around their waist and hips, and lower levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in their blood. The best part? No one reported any side effects from the treatment."
I've heard Ayurveda can boost my physical and mental health. Could it help me feel more energized and focused?,"Ayurveda is one of the ancient systems of health care of Indian origin. Roughly  translated into ""Knowledge of life"", it is based on the use of natural herbs and  herb products for therapeutic measures to boost physical, mental, social and  spiritual harmony and improve quality of life. Although sheltered with long  history and high trust, ayurveda principles have not entered laboratories and  only a handful of studies have identified pure components and molecular pathways  for its life-enhancing effects. In the post-genomic era, genome-wide functional  screenings for targets for diseases is the most recent and practical approach.  We illustrate here the merger of ayurveda and functional genomics in a systems  biology scenario that reveals the pathway analysis of crude and active  components and inspire ayurveda practice for health benefits, disease prevention  and therapeutics.","According to 'Merger of ayurveda and tissue culture-based functional genomics: inspirations from systems biology', Ayurveda is an old-school health care system from India that uses natural herbs to improve your physical and mental health. Even though it's trusted and has been around for ages, not a lot of lab studies have been done to figure out exactly why it works. But, in this new age of genomics, the scientists are checking out how it might work on a genetic level. This could help us understand better how to use Ayurveda for staying healthy and preventing diseases."
"So, I heard about this Ayurvedic stuff and these things called Doshas. How can knowing my Dosha help me stay healthy and avoid diseases like Parkinson's?","OBJECTIVE: The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, is the oldest  scientifically based system of medicine in the world. According to Ayurvedic  concepts, there are 3 humors or Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The combination  of these Doshas in varying degrees leads to one's constitution, referred to as  Prakruti. Prakruti determines one's physical, physiologic, and mental character  and disease vulnerability. This clinical study was undertaken to determine the  constitutional typing of individuals with known idiopathic Parkinson's disease  (PD) compared with that of nonparkinsonian controls. This study sought to  validate the ancient observation that persons of Vata Prakruti are at risk for  nervous system diseases. PD was used as a test case because the exact cause is  not known. METHODS: Patients with established PD (n=75) and closely related controls with  no known neurologic disease (n=73) were assessed for their Ayurvedic  constitution (Prakruti). An Ayurvedic constitutional assessment form and an  independent Ayurvedic clinical assessment were used in the patients and  controls. RESULTS: The total mean score (±standard deviation) for Vata was 11.0±3.9 in  patients with PD and 6.9±3.0 in controls. This finding was significant  (p<0.0001), indicating that the incidence of PD is highest in those with Vata  Prakruti. The incidence of PD was higher in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gained from this study may be helpful in identifying the  vulnerable population, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing disease  progression or development of treatment-related complications by keeping Vata in  balance through anti-Vata diet and lifestyle changes as prescribed in Ayurveda.","According to 'Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) identifies risk factor of developing Parkinson's disease', Ayurveda is an old Indian medical system that believes our bodies are made up of three elements: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These elements make up your constitution or Prakruti, which basically means your body type and personality. This study found out that people with a Vata dominant constitution are more likely to get Parkinson's disease. So, if your Ayurvedic constitution is Vata, you might be more at risk for nervous system diseases. The study suggests you could possibly delay the onset of symptoms or slow the progression of the disease by balancing your Vata with specific diet and lifestyle changes recommended in Ay"
"I've been dealing with lymphedema and it's been really tough. Is there a way to combine yoga, Ayurvedic practices, and modern medicine for treatment?","This paper considers the problem of evaluating multimodal integrative medicine  treatments for complex pathologic conditions. The example is given of evaluation  of highly successful treatments of lymphedema using Ayurvedic and Yoga medicine  practices together with modern medicine. For a framework to evaluate such a  complex intervention, we base our proposal on Consolidated Standards of  Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.","According to 'Evidence-based approaches for the Ayurvedic traditional herbal formulations: toward an Ayurvedic CONSORT model', this paper talks about how to properly review the effectiveness of combining traditional Indian practices like Ayurveda and Yoga with modern medicine to treat complex health issues. They use the example of treating lymphedema - a condition that causes swelling in the body due to a blockage in the lymphatic system. This combo treatment seemed to work really well and they want to set up guidelines on how to evaluate similar treatments."
"So, I've been hearing about this thing where alternative medicine doctors can also prescribe regular medicines. Is that really a thing and is it safe?","Recent changes in policies allowing practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga,  Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) to integrate into the  mainstream of healthcare and also allowing practitioners of Ayurveda and  Homoeopathy to perform medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) under the proposed  amendment to the MTP bill have brought crosssystem practice into the limelight.  We evaluate cross-system practice from its legal and ethical perspectives.  Across judgments, the judiciary has held that cross-system practice is a form of  medical negligence; however, it is permitted only in those states where the  concerned governments have authorized it by a general or special order. Further,  though a state government may authorize an alternative medicine doctor to  prescribe allopathic medicines (or vice versa), it does not condone the  prescription of wrong medicines or wrong diagnosis. Courts have also stated that  prescribing allopathic medicines and misrepresenting these as traditional  medicines is an unfair trade practice and not explaining the side-effects of a  prescribed allopathic medicine amounts to medical negligence. Finally, the  Supreme Court has cautioned that employing traditional medical practitioners who  do not possess the required skill and competence to give allopathic treatment in  hospitals and to let an emergency patient be treated by them is gross  negligence. In the event of an unwanted outcome, the responsibility is  completely on the hospital authorities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to  abolish cross-system practice, invest in healthcare, and bring radical changes  in health legislations to make right to healthcare a reality.","According to ""Ethical and legal issues in cross-system practice in India: Past, present and future"", there's been a big change in India's health care. Now, practitioners of traditional Indian medicine systems, like Ayurveda and Yoga, are being allowed to become part of mainstream healthcare. This includes performing abortions under certain circumstances. However, this blending of different health systems is causing some legal and ethical issues. The courts have said that prescribing medicines from a different system of medicine that you're not trained in is considered medical negligence, unless the state government has specifically allowed it. They've also said that it's not okay to prescribe mainstream medicines and pretend they're traditional ones, or not to mention the side-effects of mainstream medicines. Hospitals have been"
"I've been feeling really anxious lately, could it be related to what I'm eating or other cultural factors?","This article supports the call for the sensorially engaged anthropological study  of healing modalities, popular health culture, dietary practices, drug foods and  pharmaceuticals, and idioms of distress. Six concepts are of central importance  to sensorial anthropology: embodiment, the mindful body, mimesis, local biology,  somatic idioms of distress, and 'the work of culture'. Fieldwork in South and  Southeast Asia and North America illustrates how cultural interpretations  associate bodily sensations with passions (strong emotions) and anxiety states,  and bodily communication about social relations. Lay interpretations of bodily  sensations inform and are informed by local understanding of ethnophysiology,  health, illness, and the way medicines act in the body. Bodily states are  manipulated by the ingestion of substances ranging from drug foods (e.g.,  sources of caffeine, nicotine, dietary supplements) to pharmaceuticals that  stimulate or suppress sensations concordant with cultural values, work demands,  and health concerns. Social relations are articulated at the site of the body  through somatic modes of attention that index bodily ways of knowing learned  through socialization, bodily memories, and the ability to relate to how another  is likely to be feeling in a particular context. Sensorial anthropology can  contribute to the study of transformative healing and trajectories of healthcare  seeking and patterns of referral in pluralistic healthcare arenas.","According to 'Coming to our senses: appreciating the sensorial in medical anthropology', how we understand and react to our bodies can be influenced by our culture and environment. For example, the emotions we feel can affect how we physically feel and vice versa. This can also guide us on what we decide to put into our bodies, like food or medicine. It's like choosing to drink coffee to stay awake because of work, or taking specific supplements because they're popular in our community. Our bodies are basically like sponges, soaking up both the physical and social aspects of our lives, and this can impact our health in ways we might not even realize."
My grandma is going through cancer treatment and she's losing a lot of weight. Is there something she can take or do to help her gain some weight back and feel better overall?,"Anorexia and cachexia are major clinical problems seen in a large proportion of  patients with advanced cancer. Weight loss has also been identified as an  indicator of poor prognosis in cancer patients. Around 20% of patients with  advanced cancer present mortality from the effects of malnutrition rather than  from cancer itself. Early nutrition intervention has seen to improve outcomes in  cancer patients such as weight gain, treatment tolerance, and improved quality  of life (QoL). Effective therapies for addressing these threatening conditions  are lacking. Pharmacotherapeutic agents such as corticosteroids, megestrol  acetate, and cyproheptadine have several adverse reactions and also lack  satisfactory results. Rasayana therapy is known to prevent loss of body mass and  at the same time help to improve appetite and increase patient's QoL. The  Rasayana compound used by us to prevent cachexia mainly includes swarna sindoor,  Hirak bhasma, and suvarna bhasma. To evaluate benefits of Rasayana therapy on  these variables, we maintain complete documentation of different clinical  variables in all cancer patients. Here, in this observational study, we analyzed  the data collected from a group of stage IV breast cancer patients (n = 30)  receiving Rasayana therapy. Patients were followed at an interval of every 15  days from baseline for 3 months. Furthermore, at each visit, there weight was  recorded on calibrated digital weight balance. QoL in these patients was  recorded at quarterly interval using functional assessment of cancer therapies  questionnaire. It was seen that in the duration of 3 months patients appetite  increased significantly (P = 0.03). Significant weight gain was seen in patients  (P = 0.04). Significant improvement was also seen in QoL especially related to  QoL subdomains of physical wellbeing (P = 0.01), emotional wellbeing (P < 0.04),  and functional wellbeing (P < 0.001). Rasayana therapy was seen to be well  tolerated by all patients.","According to the research paper 'Addressing and targeting earnest condition of advance breast cancer-related anorexia and cachexia through Rasayana therapy', losing weight can be a serious issue for people with advanced cancer, and it can even be deadly. In fact, about 1 in 5 people with advanced cancer die from malnutrition, not the cancer itself. The good news is that a type of therapy called Rasayana can help. This therapy uses certain compounds to prevent weight loss and boost appetite. The study followed a group of women with stage IV breast cancer who were receiving Rasayana therapy and found that over three months, they gained weight, had a better appetite, and even felt better overall. So, while cancer can come with"
"So, Ayurveda suggests that our health is linked to our specific body type. Does this mean certain people are more likely to get certain diseases because of their body type?","BACKGROUND: Ayurveda is an ancient system of personalized medicine documented  and practiced in India since 1500 B.C. According to this system an individual's  basic constitution to a large extent determines predisposition and prognosis to  diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime. Ayurveda describes seven  broad constitution types (Prakritis) each with a varying degree of  predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting  types, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of  modern predictive medicine, efforts are being directed towards capturing disease  phenotypes with greater precision for successful identification of markers for  prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the different  constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates. METHODS: Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types  were identified following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian  population of Indo-European origin. The peripheral blood samples of these  individuals were analysed for genome wide expression levels, biochemical and  hematological parameters. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway based analysis was  carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were  significant enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types. RESULTS: Individuals from the three most contrasting constitutional types  exhibit striking differences with respect to biochemical and hematological  parameters and at genome wide expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver  function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological parameters like haemoglobin  exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of genes  showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched  in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent  protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation. A  significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were  observed in these extreme constitution types. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme  constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system  level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease  predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical  phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern  biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise  for future predictive medicine.","According to 'Whole genome expression and biochemical correlates of extreme constitutional types defined in Ayurveda', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system, thinks that your body type can influence your health and how likely you are to get certain diseases. The system describes seven body types, but focuses on three main ones: Vata, Pitta, Kapha. The study found that there are indeed differences in blood samples and gene expression among these three body types. This means that your body type, as defined by Ayurveda, could really affect your health. So, it might be worth checking out what your Ayurvedic body type is and how you can take care of it. This could be a new way of predicting and preventing diseases in the"
I've been hearing a lot about alternative medicines like Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine. How do they work differently from typical Western medicine to improve health?,"This paper focuses on the worldview hypotheses and research design approaches  from nonlinear dynamical complex systems (NDS) science that can inform future  studies of whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WS-CAM),  e.g., Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and homeopathy. The worldview  hypotheses that underlie NDS and WS-CAM (contextual, organismic,  interactive-integrative - Pepper, 1942) overlap with each other, but differ  fundamentally from those of biomedicine (formistic, mechanistic). Differing  views on the nature of causality itself lead to different types of study  designs. Biomedical efficacy studies assume a simple direct mechanistic  cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily  outcome, an assumption less relevant to WS-CAM outcomes. WS-CAM practitioners do  not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Rather, they intervene to modulate an  intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and to create a more  favorable environmental context for the emergence of health, e.g., with dietary  changes compatible with the constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system  thereby fosters the emergence of indirect, diffuse, complex effects throughout  the person and the person's interactions with his/her environment. NDS  theory-driven study designs thus have the potential for greater external and  model validity than biomedically driven efficacy studies (e.g., clinical trials)  for evaluating the indirect effects of WS-CAM practices. Potential applications  of NDS analytic techniques to WS-CAM include characterizing different  constitutional types and documenting the evolution and dynamics of whole-person  healing and well-being over time. Furthermore, NDS provides models and methods  for examining interactions across organizational scales, from  genomic/proteomic/metabolomic networks to individuals and social groups.","According to 'Methodological implications of nonlinear dynamical systems models for whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine', traditional medicine like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda doesn't just focus on treating one symptom. Instead, it aims to balance out the whole body to create a healthier environment, which could include changes to your diet or lifestyle. This approach is different from typical Western medicine, which usually focuses on one cause and one effect. The study suggests that this alternative medicine approach might actually be more effective in some cases because it considers the whole person and their interactions with their environment. They're looking into using new research methods to better understand and document how these traditional medicine systems work."
I've got pimples and it's really hurting my self-esteem. Is there an Ayurvedic remedy that could help me out?,"Eighty-two patients with acne vulgaris were randomised into five groups. Four  different Ayurvedic treatment schedules were given orally for 6 weeks, while one  group received a placebo. Physical and clinical investigations were carried out  at 2 week intervals. A significant reduction in lesion count was observed in  patients receiving Sunder Vati when compared with the placebo and the other  Ayurvedic formulations, which failed to produce any significant difference from  the pretreatment condition. The drug therapies were well tolerated.","According to 'Comparative efficacy of four Ayurvedic formulations in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled clinical evaluation', researchers tested four different natural Ayurvedic treatments for acne on a bunch of people. One treatment, called Sunder Vati, was found to be more effective in reducing acne than the others and a fake treatment (a placebo). The best part? People didn't have any bad reactions to it. So, if you're struggling with acne, Sunder Vati could be worth a try."
I've been hearing about this ayurvedic medicine called Hepatomed that's supposed to be good for your liver. Is it actually safe and effective?,"Hepatoprotective effect of Hepatomed (an ayurvedic drug containing water extract  of 6 medicinal plants) has been studied on cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) induced  lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione content in rat liver homogenate. In  vitro experiments show significant reduction in the level of malondialdehyde  (MDA) induced by 1.5 mM cumene hydroperoxide(CHP). Glutathione content was  almost maintained to normal in drug treated rats. Oral treatment of drug up to 3  ml/100 g body weight for 15 days did not show any rise in serum GOT and GPT. On  similar doses, significant choleratic effect was observed without any adverse  histological changes after 4 days treatment. The results suggest that  'Hepatomed' is a strong hepatoprotective ayurvedic medicine with no detectable  adverse effects.","According to 'Hepatoprotective and toxicological evaluation of hepatomed, an ayurvedic drug', Hepatomed - a medicine made from the water extracts of 6 different plants - can help protect your liver without any noticeable bad side effects. This study was done on rats and showed that taking this drug kept their liver healthy, even when it was exposed to harmful substances. So, if you're looking for a natural way to keep your liver in check, Hepatomed might be worth looking into. Just remember, these studies were done on rats, not humans, so it's always a good idea to talk to a doctor first."
"I've heard about all these celebrities getting nose jobs and stuff, but how far back does this kind of surgery actually go? Like, when did people start messing with their faces?","The rising and the existence of plastic and aesthetic surgery in early modern  Europe did not have a specific pattern, but was completely different from one  nation to another. Colleges of Physicians could only be found in some places in  Europe; different Parliaments of Europe's nations did not always elevate being a  surgeon to the dignity of a profession, and being a surgeon did not always come  with corporate and municipal privileges, or with attractive stipends.  Conversely, corporal punishments for treacherous surgeons were ubiquitous.  Rhinoplasty falls into the category of what Ambroise Paré named ""facial plastic  surgery"". The technique is a medical source from which many histories derive,  one more fascinating than the other: the history of those whose nose was cut off  (because of state betrayal, adultery, abjuration, or duelling with swords), the  history of those who invented the surgery of nose reconstruction (e.g.  SuSruta-samhita or Tagliacozzi?), the history of surgeries kept secret in early  modern Europe (e.g. Tropea, Calabria, Leiden, Padua, Paris, Berlin), and so on.  Where does the history of Nicolae Milescu the Snub-nosed fall in all of this?  How much of this history do the Moldavian Chronicles record? Is there any  ""scholarly gossip"" in the aristocratic and diplomatic environments at  Constantinople? What exactly do the British ambassadors learn concerning  Rhinoplasty when they meet Milescu? How do we ""walk"" within these histories, and  why should we be interested at all? What is their stike for modernity? Such are  the interrogations that this article seeks to provoke; its purpose is to  question (and eventually, synchronise) histories, and not exclusively history,  both in academic terms but also by reassessing the practical knowledge of the  17th century.","According to the research paper 'Plastic surgery in 17th century Europe. case study: Nicolae Milescu, the snub-nosed', the development of plastic surgery, particularly nose jobs, was pretty random across Europe back in the day. It wasn't always seen as a respectable job, and in some places, dodgy surgeons would even be punished. The paper asks a lot of questions about the history of nose jobs, like who first came up with the idea, who got their noses chopped off and why, and how much of this was common knowledge at the time. It also brings up Nicolae Milescu, a guy known for having a snub nose, and tries to figure out his story. The paper is all"
Are there any natural herbs or plants that can boost my immune system?,Some of the medicinal plants valued in Ayurvedic Rasayana for their therapeutic  potential have been scientifically investigated with promising results. A number  of plant-based principles have been isolated with potential immunomodulatory  activity that can explain and justify their use in traditional medicine in the  past and can form the basis for further research in the future as well. The aim  of this review is to highlight results of research done on immunomodulators of  plant origin. The selection of papers was made using the most relevant databases  for the biomedical sciences on the basis of their ethnopharmacological use. Many  plants and some phytoconstituents responsible for immunomodulation have been  explained. The review also discusses biological screening methods for various  plant drugs that focus on revealing the mechanism involved in immunomodulation.  This work shall hopefully encourage researchers to undertake further work on  medicinal plants with potential immunomodulatory activity.,"According to 'A review of immunomodulators in the Indian traditional health care system', certain plants used in traditional Indian medicine have been found to boost your immune system. The science behind why these plants work is being studied more and more, which could help take these ancient remedies into the future. Basically, researchers are looking at how these plants can help keep you healthy and fight off sickness."
"So, there's this root called I. racemosa that can lower blood sugar but doesn't mess with my insulin levels. Could this help me manage my sweet tooth without triggering any weird side effects?","Alcoholic extract of the root of I. racemosa lowers blood glucose and enhances  liver glycogen without increasing plasma insulin in rats. There is also no  increase in degree of degranulation of the beta cells of pancreas. In similar  conditions it does not show any effect on activity of adrenal gland. However,  thyroid gland undergoes activation at the later stage (delayed response). It  appears that hypoglycemic response of I. racemosa is not due to enhanced  secretion/synthesis of insulin; the action may be at the peripheral level by  potentiating the insulin sensitivity.","According to 'Assessment of endocrine response of Inula racemosa in relation to glucose homeostasis in rats', the root of I. racemosa, a plant, can lower blood sugar and help your liver store more energy, all without needing to produce more insulin. It doesn't affect your adrenal glands, but it does seem to kick your thyroid into gear a bit later. So, it seems like it could be useful for people who need help managing their blood sugar levels, but without the need for extra insulin."
"So, I've heard about this Ayurvedic treatment for fistulas using something called a Kshara Sutra thread.

I've heard about Ayurvedic treatments for muscle issues. Which one is better between navarakizhi and pinda sweda?,"INTRODUCTION: Hemiplegia and the Ayurvedic description of ardhanga disease  presents with comparable clinical features. This pilot trial compared two  traditional procedure-based treatments: Navarakizhi, a massage of cooked navara  rice in a medicated hot bolus, and pinda sweda, a similar massage made of a  different type of rice. This article also describes the steps of a double-blind  trial in Ayurveda, which was hitherto considered difficult to perform. METHODS: Eighteen (18) patients suffering from hemiplegia with disease duration  of 6 months to 2 years received treatment with navarakizhi or pinda sweda for 7  days. Both groups received the same Ayurvedic oral medications for 14 days. All  steps of randomization and blinding of procedure-based therapy in Ayurveda are  described. The physiotherapist evaluated muscle tone, muscle strength, tendon  reflexes, range of movement, and balance of functional abilities at baseline, 7  days, and 14 days after starting therapy. Both patient and the assessing  physiotherapist were blinded. RESULTS: Intraquartile range values showed better range in patients who received  navarakizhi than those who received pinda sweda. DISCUSSION: A larger trial is needed to confirm the superiority of navarakizhi  over the rice varieties in treating hemiplegia. This study demonstrates that  double-blind randomized clinical trials are possible in Ayurvedic settings,  ending the long-debated controversy in trial methodology involving  procedure-based traditional medicines.","According to 'Navarakizhi and pinda sweda as muscle-nourishing Ayurveda procedures in hemiplegia: double-blind randomized comparative pilot clinical trial', researchers tested two types of traditional Ayurvedic massages to see which one works better for patients with hemiplegia, a condition where one side of your body is paralyzed. The two methods involved massaging with different types of rice. They found out that the massage using a type of rice called 'navara' seemed to work better than the other one. However, they need to do larger studies to be sure about this. This study also showed that it's possible to do these types of tests in Ayurvedic treatments, ending a long-standing debate about it."
"I've been feeling stressed lately, could using this herb called Jibanti in my diet help my body handle stress better?","The herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl. (family: Orchidaceae), sold as Jibanti in  West Bengal, is used in 'Rasayana therapy' in Ayurveda. Its effect on the  modulation of the two antioxidant enzymes peroxidase and catalase has been  studied in mice liver during 'cold water swim' (CWS) stress using appropriate  controls. The drug, i.e. the aqueous ethanolic extract of the herb (whole plant)  was found to increase peroxidase titre in the hepatic cells of normal mice. But  in the stressed group, the drug displayed no effect on the peroxidase content,  while it elicited an elevation of the catalase content. infinity-Tocoferol was  used as the standard drug. These data suggested that the drug can ameliorate the  peroxidative damage caused in mice by CWS stress.","According to 'Induction of antioxidative enzyme by the ayurvedic herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl. in mice', there's a herb called Jibanti that's commonly used in Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system. When scientists researched this herb, they found that it boosted the activity of certain helpful enzymes in the liver of mice. This basically means that Jibanti could help protect the liver from damage, especially in stressful situations like when the mice were made to swim in cold water."
I keep hearing about AYUSH and Universal Health Coverage in India. What is it and how does it work exactly?,"Universal health coverage (UHC) in the Indian context is understood as easily  accessible and affordable health services for all citizens. The Planning  Commission of India constituted a High Level Expert Group (HLEG) in October 2010  for the purpose of drafting the guidelines of UHC. While the primary focus of  UHC is to provide financial protection to all citizens, its delivery requires an  adequate health infrastructure, skilled health human resources, and access to  affordable drugs and technologies so that all people receive the level and  quality of care they are entitled to. This paper attempts to link the ayurveda,  yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH) systems of medicine  with UHC. Here, the AYUSH system refers to the AYUSH workforce, therapeutics and  principles, and their individual role in delivering UHC to the citizens of  India. In outlining the role of AYUSH, the paper lays stress on the 10 guiding  principles of UHC, as proposed by the HLEG. However, as the AYUSH system is not  the principal health service provider in India, the dominant system being that  of allopathic medicine, a few components of UHC may not fit neatly into the  AYUSH system. This paper has adopted the definition of UHC quoted by the HLEG.","According to 'Can the AYUSH system be instrumental in achieving universal health coverage in India?', India is trying to make sure everyone can get affordable health care. To achieve this, they need enough medical facilities, trained health workers, and low-cost drugs and equipment. A group of experts is looking at how traditional Indian medicine systems like ayurveda, yoga, and more, known as AYUSH, can play a role in this. But since AYUSH isn't the main type of healthcare in India, not everything about this universal health care plan may work perfectly with it."
"So, I heard there's no specific treatment for COVID-19 yet, but I saw something about Ayurvedic treatments helping with recovery. Is that true? Can you tell me more about it?","BACKGROUND: Specific treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Outcomes of  clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success. Therefore,  it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against  COVID-19. PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian  Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical  trial. METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide  Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of  Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India.  1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional  herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)  and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in  treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of  tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in  powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30  min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu  taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast.  Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post  randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the  detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of  study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was  used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-α) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day  7 of the study. RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and  placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100 % recovery by day 7,  while it was 60.0 % in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels  of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20  times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40 % absolute  reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in  faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination.  Reduced inflammation markers suggested less severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in  the treatment group. Moreover, there was no adverse effect observed to be  associated with this treatment.","According to 'Randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial on the efficacy of ayurvedic treatment regime on COVID-19 positive patients', traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatments might help speed up recovery from COVID-19. The study gave a mix of herbs and minerals to some patients: Giloy Ghanvati, Swasari Ras, Ashwagandha, and Tulsi Ghanvati twice a day for a week, along with a traditional nasal drop called Anu taila. By the third day, about 71% of these patients had recovered, compared to only 50% in the group who didn't receive this treatment. By the end of the week, everyone in the treatment group had recovered, while only 60%"
"I've been diagnosed with some sort of hyperplastic process in my endometrium. Are there any natural remedies or supplements that could help me recover, especially after hormone therapy?","Hyperplastic processes in the endometrium are classified as a common  gynecological pathology. The drug chavanprash has been shown to improve general  bodily resistance, to enhance vital tone of the body. It is endowed with a  manifest hepatotropic and antitoxic activity, which fact permits recommending it  for use in the combination therapy of hyperplastic processes in the endometrium  as well as during the period of rehabilitation in the wake of the course of  hormonotherapy.","According to 'Chavanprash in the treatment of hyperplastic processes in the endometrium', chavanprash - a type of herbal jam - might be helpful for certain women's health issues. It seems to boost the body's natural defenses and overall energy levels. Plus, it can help your liver do its job and get rid of toxins in your body. So, it's suggested to use it along with other treatments, or even after treatment, to help your body bounce back."

I've heard a lot about using plants for health benefits. Is there something specific that neem can help with?,"The divine tree neem (Azadirachta indica) is mainly cultivated in the Indian  subcontinent. Neem has been used extensively by humankind to treat various  ailments before the availability of written records which recorded the beginning  of history. The world health organization estimates that 80% of the population  living in the developing countries relies exclusively on traditional medicine  for their primary health care. More than half of the world's population still  relies entirely on plants for medicines, and plants supply the active  ingredients of most traditional medical products. The review shows the neem has  been used by humankind to treat various ailments from prehistory to  contemporary.","According to 'Neem (Azadirachta indica): prehistory to contemporary medicinal uses to humankind', the neem tree, commonly found in India, has been used since ancient times to treat various health issues. Even nowadays, in many developing countries, the majority of people rely on traditional plant-based medicines for their health care. So, think of the neem tree as a natural pharmacy, providing key ingredients for many traditional medicines."
I've been hearing a lot about Ayurvedic medicine like Guduchi and Madhuyashti. Do they have any effects on energy levels or overall wellness?,"Formulations from the traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, have long been  considered to have potent life-style enhancing effects, possibly by their  effect(s) on key life-history attributes. Although several studies have reported  beneficial effects of these formulations on different components of life  history, few have investigated their concurrent influence on various  life-history traits. Here, we report the results of an investigation showing the  effect of two well-known Ayurvedic formulations, Guduchi and Madhuyashti, on  fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were either grown  (i.e., larval exposure) and/or maintained (i.e., adult exposure) on standard  food supplemented with 0.5% Guduchi or 0.5% Madhuyashti. It was observed that  the longevity of adult flies of both sexes was not affected on feeding  Guduchifood, but fecundity of the females was greatly enhanced. Fecundity was  also found to be affected by the adult food and whether their mates were grown  on Guduchi or normal food. Madhuyashti, on the other hand, significantly reduced  mean longevity and had a stimulatory effect on female fecundity. This fecundity  enhancing effect however seemed to be mediated through its effect on the males.  Interestingly, much of these effects interacted with age in a complex way,  making it difficult to generalize the overall effect of these formulations on  the reproductive output of the flies. Ourstudy underlines the importance of  evaluating the interacting effects of these (and similar) formulations on a  range of life-history traits in a holistic way to understand their utility  better.","According to 'Complex effects of Ayurvedic formulation: Guduchi and Madhuyashti on different components of life history may elude the elixir effect', researchers found out that adding Ayurvedic herbs like Guduchi and Madhuyashti to the diet of fruit flies had some interesting results. Guduchi didn't change how long the flies lived, but it did make the female flies have more babies. Madhuyashti, on the other hand, made the flies live a bit less, but again, the female flies had more babies. It's like these herbs are giving the flies a fertility boost. However, the effects changed as the flies got older, so it's hard to say exactly what's"
"So, like, how does the way people in rural Sri Lanka use Western medicine relate to their traditional health beliefs?","In this paper I want to draw attention to the integration of Western medicine  into therapeutic choices among patients in rural Sri Lanka. These patients'  interpretation and use of Western pharmaceuticals is discussed in relation to  the Ayurvedic theory of balance. The influence of this theory on people's ideas  of health and illness is highlighted in encounters where laymen and  professionals alike use Western medicines according to context and their  respective perspectives. Such therapeutic encounters are used to describe how  the meaning of therapy is negotiated and communicated. The modes of perception  used by doctors and patients seem to be mutually exclusive but each has its own  logic. Western medicines are used as a symbolic means which help the patients  and the practitioners of Western clinical medicine in a rural health unit to  communicate through - rather than despite - ""misunderstandings"" based on their  differing cultural assumptions about the body, about disease and about therapy.  This argument is raised in relation to recent theoretical discussions among  medical anthropologists concerning doctor-patient relationships, asymmetric  medical relations and the analysis of meaning systems.","According to 'Misunderstanding as therapy: doctors, patients and medicines in a rural clinic in Sri Lanka', people in rural Sri Lanka use Western medicine, but they interpret it differently based on their own cultural beliefs around health and illness. Even though doctors and patients might not fully understand each other's views, they can still communicate and make treatment decisions. So, it's like having a conversation with someone who has a completely different perspective but still finding a common ground and understanding."
"Why do I feel like my doctor doesn't really understand my health problems, even though he's doing all these tests and stuff?","The basic premise of the paper is that Western medicine's co-opting of specific  technologies and materials from other (indigenous) medical traditions, stripped  of the original theories underlying their use, has problematic consequences for  the practitioners and patients of both source and recipient traditions. The  paper begins by illustrating the historical continuity of this process by way of  an example from India's colonial era. The fact that specific practices or  materials are regarded as biomedically useful because they 'work' (are  efficacious) does not mean that the 'traditional' theories underlying them are  seen as correct. The knowledge contained in these traditions is not counted as  legitimate, as the emphasis in biomedicine (the legitimate canon) on an  identifiable concrete location in the body for the source of health problems  creates difficulties-both for patients when their problems are not provided with  a cause that matches their subjective awareness, and for the practitioners of  other traditions whose patients have been exposed to biomedicine. The paper goes  on to demonstrate, using case examples from extended ethnographic fieldwork in  southern India, how this is played out in a setting in which an educated Indian  patient population accepts this form of knowledge as legitimate but espouses  ayurvedic therapy. Notions of 'evidence' are shown to be central to the  interplay between biomedical and other medical traditions, since objective tests  and measures in biomedicine are accepted as the only legitimate 'evidence' of  cure, but these do not necessarily accord either with the premises of these  other traditions or with patients' subjective perceptions of well-being.  Returning to an acceptance and practice of other traditions, consequently,  requires nothing less than a fundamental cognitive shift in the grounds for what  constitutes 'evidence.'","According to 'Of spineless babies and folic acid: evidence and efficacy in biomedicine and ayurvedic medicine,' Western medicine often borrows practices from traditional medicine like Ayurveda, but without including the original ideas behind those practices. This can cause some confusion or miscommunication between doctors and patients, especially when patients don't feel their health issues align with how they're being treated. For example, in India, many educated patients accept Western medicine's factual approach, but they also value Ayurvedic treatment, which might look at their health more holistically. The paper suggests that it's important to consider different kinds of evidence in medicine - not just lab tests, but also how a patient feels about their health."
"So, I heard about these 'bone doctors' in India who aren't formally trained. Are they really trustworthy or should I stick to officially recognized doctors?","Current health policy initiatives in India advocate medical pluralism and seek  to address a lack of skilled human resources for health care provision. This  qualitative study investigated a form of indigenous therapy that does not fit  into officially recognised categories of 'Indian medicine' but is a popular  source of informal medical care. Semi-structured interviews and ethnographic  observations of 30 'bone doctor' (haad vaidya) practices were conducted in the  capital city of Rajasthan, north India in 2009-2010 together with historical  analysis of changes in state policies for the registration of Indian medicine  practitioners. Contestations over legitimacy among individual practitioners and  hierarchies of authority between different medical traditions are shown to rest  on conceptions of what constitutes authentic 'expertise'. The findings  demonstrate a progressive restriction over time in official definitions of  medical expertise, towards a reliance exclusively on formal qualifications  rather than experientially acquired and inherited skills to demarcate legitimate  therapeutic knowledge. This case study contributes to our understanding of the  nature of non-professional expertise and its implications for pluralistic health  care policy and the human resourcing of Indian health systems.","According to ""Medical pluralism and medical marginality: bone doctors and the selective legitimation of therapeutic expertise in India"", India is trying to include different types of medicine in their healthcare policy, not just mainstream medicine. This study looked at local bone doctors in Rajasthan who aren't officially recognized as 'Indian medicine', even though they're pretty popular. They found that who gets to be called a 'legitimate' doctor is changing, nowadays it's all about formal qualifications rather than skills gained from experience or passed down through generations. This research helps us understand how different types of medical knowledge are valued and what that means for healthcare in India."
"So, I've heard that certain herbs and spices can be good for my health. Can they really boost my body's defenses or is that just a myth?","Background: Ayurveda, the traditional Indian therapeutic system, involves herbs  and spices as drug ingredients and a kind of food intake regulation. The health  and curative aspects of plant products are often ascribed to their antimicrobial  and antioxidant activities (AA). However, it seems somewhat possible to  correlate the AA of herbal extracts or plant isolates with their phenolic  contents (PC). Objective: Indian researchers have carried out some tests for the  determination of AA and PC of plant products that are worth mentioning. Methods:  Among the herbal analysis techniques, the important contributions of Indians and  people of Indian origin in this field include the remarkable separation of  phenolic compounds, including the use of reversed-phase columns, on-line HPLC,  the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay to effectively screen and  identify antioxidant compounds from herbal extracts, and other chromatographic,  spectrographic, and spectroscopic techniques, in the analysis of complex  biological matrices. Results: The aim of this paper is to present an overview of  such arguments with reference to herbal drugs and food intake regulation for  specific ailments. Conclusions: The lack of uniformity in the use of test  protocols for antioxidant assays (particularly using the DPPH free radical) and  differences in in vitro mechanisms of antiradical activity and in vivo  metabolism of polyphenols have been the issues associated with these experiments  that have been raised by researchers in the period from 2000 onward.","According to 'Studies on the Determination of Antioxidant Activity and Phenolic Content of Plant Products in India (2000-2017)', traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, uses a lot of herbs and spices. These plant products are believed to be good for your health and can help you fight off diseases because of their antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Indian scientists have been studying these plants and found that the more of these special compounds called phenolics they have, the stronger their antioxidant powers might be. However, there's no standard way of testing this, so results can vary. It's also important to note that the way your body processes these compounds could affect how well they work."
"Do people in Sri Lanka really use traditional remedies to treat cancer, and why do they believe it could work?","OBJECTIVES: While the introduction of biomedicine within the Sri Lankan  healthcare system has resulted in reduced reliance on traditional, complementary  and alternative medicine (TCAM) over the last century in Sri Lanka, treatment  modalities such as Ayurveda, Sinhala and traditional religious practices still  receive considerable public support. Cancer is an increasing burden in Sri  Lanka, and whilst Sri Lankans are known to use TCAM for everyday ailments, there  has been no research examining the role of TCAM in the context of cancer. The  aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of TCAM use by  cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were obtained from two Sri Lankan hospitals using a consecutive  convenience sample of 500 cancer patients currently receiving biomedical  treatment, over a 10-week period in 2008. RESULTS: Analyses showed that 67.4% of those surveyed used one or more TCAM in  conjunction with biomedicine for cancer treatment. The most common were Sinhala,  Ayurveda and traditional religious practices. Of those patients who used TCAM,  95.0% gave the main reason for usage as 'they thought it would cure their  cancer'. The strongest reason for not using TCAM was on advice from their doctor  (80.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The high use of TCAM amongst cancer patients in Sri Lanka raises  numerous important issues, including those related to patient safety, potential  benefit, interactions with biomedical cancer treatments, and delays in seeking  biomedical cancer care. Further research is needed to explore the  decision-making processes of cancer patients, including the perceived  benefits/limitations of key processes in biomedical and TCAM care.","According to 'The use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine in Sri Lankan cancer care: results from a survey of 500 cancer patients', a lot of cancer patients in Sri Lanka are using traditional and alternative medicines along with their regular cancer treatments. They use methods like Ayurveda and traditional religious practices, because they believe it might cure their cancer. But the study also points out that this could potentially cause problems, like messing with the regular cancer treatments or causing patients to delay getting medical care. This needs more research to understand why patients are choosing to do this and what they think the pros and cons are."
I've heard about these Ayurvedic treatments that contain something called berberine. Can you explain how they figure out how much berberine is in them?,"A sensitive, simple, rapid, and efficient high-performance thin-layer  chromatographic (HPTLC) method has been developed and validated for the analysis  of berberine in marketed Ayurvedic formulations containing Berberis aristata DC  for regulatory purposes. Chromatography of methanolic extracts of these  formulations was performed on silica gel 60 F254 aluminum-backed TLC plates of  0.2 mm layer thickness. The plate was developed up to 66 mm with the  ternary-mobile phase butanol-acetic acid-water (8 + 1 + 1, v/v/v) at 33 +/- 5  degrees C with 5 min of tank saturation. The marker, berberine, was quantified  at its maximum absorbance of 350 nm. The limit of detection and limit of  quantitation values were found to be 5 and 10 ng/spot. The linear regression  analysis data for the calibration plot showed a good linear relationship with  correlation coefficient = 0.9994 in the concentration range of 10 to 50 ng/spot  for berberine with respect to peak area. The instrumental precision was found to  be 0.49% coefficient of variation (CV), and repeatability of the method was  0.73% CV. Recovery values from 98.27 to 99.11% indicate excellent accuracy of  the method. The developed HPTLC method is very accurate, precise, and  cost-effective, and it has been successfully applied to the assay of marketed  formulations containing B. aristata for determination of berberine.","According to the research paper 'Estimation of berberine in ayurvedic formulations containing Berberis aristata', scientists have developed a quick, simple, and effective way to measure the amount of a compound called berberine in Ayurvedic products. They used a special technique called High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (think of it like a super advanced version of those color-changing strips you used in high school chemistry) to identify and measure berberine. The method is really precise and accurate. It's also affordable, making it a great tool for looking into these Ayurvedic products. They've already used it to successfully test some products on the market. This is important because it helps ensure the quality and effectiveness of these"
Are there any natural remedies or herbs I could use to help with my constant stomach issues and skin problems?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal Plant resources of forest origin are  extensively used in India for various systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani,  Homeopathy, Allopathy, Siddha and Ethnic etc. The tribal communities around the  Kakrajhore forest in West Medinipur district of West Bengal have their own  traditional knowledge based system of curing many diseases using the forest  based plant resources similar to ayurveda. The forest comprises of one of the  unique treasure and rich source of diversified ethno-botanical wealth and  therefore extensive studies is required for proper documentation including  ethnomedicinal knowledge of local tribes. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was initiated with an aim to inventorize the  ayurvedic medicinal plant recourses and explore the traditional knowledge of  tribal people of Kakrajhore forest to treat several diseases along with the  sustainable management and conservation of medicinal plants. METHODS: The information on the medicinal plant resources were gathered through  floristic inventorization with proper sampling method in the study area  (N22°42'57.05″, E86°34'58.02″) during the year 2015. For floristic  inventorization the study area of 312 ha was delineated by using GPS Receiver.  Then total mapped area was divided by virtual grid of 100m apart in both  East-West and North-South direction to allocate 60 sample plots by random  sampling. In addition to inventorization, the use value (UV) of the species was  determined and the informant consensus factor (ICF) was calculated for the  medicinal plants found in the study area based on personal interview. Further  exploration was carried out to establish linkage with Ayurveda. RESULTS: The present survey has identified 57 numbers of ethno-medicinal plants  belonging to 39 families, used for preparing medicinal remedies. The habit of  the plants includes 35% trees, 28% shrubs, 23% herbs and 14% climbers. The most  frequently utilized plant parts were the Roots & Tuber roots (26%), Stem which  includes Bark, Tubers, Bulb, Rhizome, Gum, Wood & Young shoots (24%), Leaves  (18%), Fruits (13%), and Seeds (10%). The most frequent happening ailments are  asthma and bronchitis, constipation and dyspepsia, diarrhea, dysentery, ulcer,  rheumatism, arthritis, fistula and piles troubles. Most of the Plants (88%) had  more than a single therapeutic use. The most important plant species on the  basis of use value were Smilex ovalifolia, Emblica officinalis, Curculigo  orchioides, Croton roxburghii, Asparagus racemosus, Ziziphus nummularia,  Ichnocarpus frutescens, Cisssus adnata, Buettneria herbacea, Litsea glutinosa,  Vernonia anthelmintica and Chlorophytum borivilianum. There was a strong  agreement among the informants related to the usage of the plants (ICF  0.65-0.93). As per the standard literature in Ayurveda, maximum numbers of  documented species (33) are found to be used for 'digestive system disorder'  which is analogous to ethnomedicinal use (30), followed by 'skin related  problem' i.e. 13 and 20 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that people living around Kakrajhore forest area hold  valuable knowledge of the uses of plant resources and some of the ayurvedic  plants represent an important component in local livelihood. Though the  Kakrajhore Forest area is rich in medicinal plant resources but the species are  susceptible to be endangered by intense exploitation by human communities. More  in-depth investigations are required for plants with high UV values on their  possible phytochemical and pharmacological activity. Apart from this,  sustainable management approach and proper conservation strategy for the area is  recommended by involvement of local communities and forest department.","According to 'Inventorization of some ayurvedic plants and their ethnomedicinal use in Kakrajhore forest area of West Bengal', the local tribes in the Kakrajhore forest area in West Bengal, India, know a lot about using plants to treat various health issues. The study found 57 different plant types that are used for medical remedies. Some of these plants are used to treat common issues like asthma, constipation, and arthritis. Interestingly, about 88% of these plants can be used for more than just one health problem. The most commonly used parts of these plants are the roots, stems, and leaves. However, the study also mentions that these plants are at risk due to overuse by humans."
I've been diagnosed with diabetes and I'm not a fan of taking a ton of pills. Are there any natural herbs that could help manage my sugar levels?,"Herbal medicines have been used in the management of diabetes in traditional  medicine. This chapter reviews recent findings of the most popular herbs  reported to treat diabetes through their relevant mechanistic pathways. These  include increased insulin secretion, improvement in insulin sensitivity,  enhanced glucose uptake by adipose and muscle tissues, inhibition of glucose  absorption from intestine, inhibition of glucose production from hepatocytes and  anti-inflammatory activities. The pharmacological activities have highlighted  the potential efficacy of these herbal medicines in the management of diabetes.","According to 'Herbal medicines for the management of diabetes', herbal remedies have been found to help manage diabetes. These herbs can help increase the body's own insulin production, improve how the body uses insulin, help body tissues take in more sugar, and reduce sugar absorption from food.

I've been hearing a lot about the benefits of medicinal plants. Are there any that could help with common issues like stress or bad digestion?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants belong to the oldest known  health care products that have been used by human beings all over the world and  are major components of the formulations used in indigenous system of medicine  practiced in many countries. Besides, finding place as health supplements,  nutraceuticals, cosmetics, herbal tea etc. there has been a global insurgence of  interest, including India, leading to enormous research/activities in the area  of medicinal plants. AIM OF THE STUDY: The article is aimed to provide the effort and initiatives of  ICMR towards research on medicinal plants and its contributions on consolidation  of Indian research on medicinal plants that are very relevant and important in  the national context. METHODS: The various initiatives undertaken by ICMR on research on traditional  medicines/medicinal plants in the past are reviewed and documented in this  article. RESULTS: The multi-disciplinary, multicentric research initiatives of ICMR have  resulted in validation of traditional treatment Kshaarasootra (medicated  Ayurvedic thread) for anal fistula, Vijayasar (heart wood of Pterocarpus  marsupium Roxb.) for diabetes mellitus, encouraging micro- and macrofilaricidal  activity of Shakotak (stem bark of Streblus asper Lour.) in experimental studies  an iridoid glycosides fraction isolated from root/rhizomes of Picrorhiza kurroa  Royle ex Benth. (designated as Picroliv) for viral hepatitis. Other  developmental and compilation of research works on Indian medicinal plants have  resulted in publications of the thirteen volumes of quality standards,  comprising of 449 Indian medicinal plants; three volumes of 90 phytochemical  reference standards; fifteen volumes of review monographs on 4167 medicinal  plant species; and one publication each on perspectives of Indian medicinal  plants for management of liver disorders, lymphatic filariasis and diabetes  mellitus (details available at http://www.icmr.nic.in/mpsite). CONCLUSION: The ICMR efforts assume special significance in the light of  multifaceted use of medicinal plants, and the need of better drugs and remedies  for various diseases. Further, the indigenous system of medicine, and the plant  drugs, could promise to provide both concepts of therapy, as well as therapeutic  agents in the areas, where modern system of medicines has few answers. The  developement of quality standards and review monographs also help the  regulators, pharmacopoeial bodies and drug industry towards generation of  quality herbal drugs or traditional medicine preparations. These initiatives are  also in favour of the World Health Organisation advocating herbal medicines as a  valid alternative system of therapy in the form of phytomedicines or herbal  drugs or herbal drug preparations or herbal medicinal products.","According to 'Contributions of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the area of Medicinal plants/Traditional medicine', medicinal plants have been used by humans around the world for a long time as part of traditional medicine, health supplements, and even cosmetics. There's been a growing interest in this area, particularly in India, and a lot of research is going on. The ICMR has been particularly active in this field, and they've made some cool discoveries. For example, they've found that a certain type of thread used in Ayurvedic medicine can help treat anal fistulas, a kind of painful abscess. They've also found that the heartwood of the Vijayasar tree can be used to treat diabetes, and"
"Is there a type of traditional medicine that could help me feel more balanced, like mind, body, and spirit all in sync?","Traditional ways of healing illnesses originating in ancient societies are  called complementary medicine today. Many of the traditional medical systems are  based on sound fundamental principles and centuries of practices by healers.  This article reviews some of the most commonly practiced traditional medical  systems. A common factor noted in several traditional systems is a holistic  approach to the well-being of a person's body, mind, and spirit.","According to 'Traditional systems of medicine', the old-school methods of healing sickness, which we now call complementary medicine, are pretty legit. They've been around for hundreds of years and focus on taking care of not just your body, but also your mind and spirit. It's not just about getting rid of a cold, it's about making sure you're feeling good overall."
"I've heard a lot about Ayurveda recently. Is it safe and common to use in the US, especially for someone like me who's not of Indian descent?","OBJECTIVE: Despite a growing body of literature on complementary and alternative  medicine, there is still limited information on the use of Ayurveda in the  United States. Because Ayurveda is one of the world's major traditional medical  systems, knowledge of its use is important. In particular, information on  utilization by Asian Indians living in the United States is needed due to  increased immigration from India and related regions. Recent reports of heavy  metal contamination of some imported Ayurveda products underscore this need. For  this reason, an exploratory survey was conducted. DESIGN: A semistructured 21-item questionnaire was administered using  face-to-face interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study comprised a convenience sample of 64 Asian  Indians living in Northern California. OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included sociodemographic variables,  questions on awareness, knowledge and use of Ayurvedic products or services, use  of other nutritional/herbal products, and reasons for use. RESULTS: In the sample, 95% of the participants were aware of Ayurveda, 78% had  knowledge of Ayurvedic products or treatments, and about 59% had used or were  currently using Ayurveda. Only 18% of those using Ayurveda had informed their  Western medical doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Given its common use in the United States by Asian Indians, its  cultural relevance, potential therapeutic value, and possible safety concerns,  physician and consumer education along with more empirical research is  warranted.","According to 'Exploring the prevalence of Ayurveda use among Asian Indians', a lot of Asian Indians living in California know about and use Ayurveda, a traditional type of medicine from India. In fact, almost 60% of them have used or are currently using Ayurvedic products or treatments. However, not many people let their doctors know that they're using this alternative medicine. The study also pointed out that there could be safety issues, like heavy metals in some Ayurveda products. So, it's pretty important for both doctors and patients to be more informed about Ayurveda and more research needs to be done."
I've been hearing a lot about these alternative medicines from India like Ayurveda. Are they safe to use and how would I know if they're right for me?,"Non-allopathic Indian medicines, referred to elsewhere in the world as  complementary and alternative medicine have gathered increasing recognition in  recent years with regard to both treatment options and health hazards. Ayurveda,  Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems.  These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet,  herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as  non-drug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and  by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India,  particularly in rural India, where 70% of the population lives. The difference  between modern medicine and these systems stems from the fact that the knowledge  base of many of the above systems, unlike Western medicine, is based on years of  experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and has been handed down  generations both through word of mouth and treatises. The focus on  non-allopathic systems of medicine in India can be attributed to various causes  including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80% of the  country's population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing  worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific  research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. Elsewhere, the increasing use  of herbal products worldwide and the growth of the herbal product industry has  led to increasing concern regarding their safety. The challenges in these  non-allopathic systems relate to the patient, physician, regulatory authorities,  the abuse/misuse of these medicines, quality and purity issues. Safety  monitoring is mandated by a changing ecological environment, the use of  insecticides, new manufacturing techniques, an as yet unregulated pharmaceutical  industry, the availability of combinations of herbs over the counter and not  mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the need to look at the active  principles of these medicines as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The Indian  traditional medicine industry has come a long way from the times when it was  considered unnecessary to test these formulations prior to use, to the  introduction of Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for the industry.  However, we still have a long way to go. The conflict between the traditional  practitioners and the purists demanding evidence of safety and efficacy needs to  be addressed. There is an urgent need for the practitioners of the allopathic  and non-allopathic systems to work together to optimise the risk-benefit profile  of these medicines.","According to 'The use and safety of non-allopathic Indian medicines', traditional Indian medicine practices like Ayurveda are getting more popular. They use a variety of approaches, including diet changes, herbs, metals, and even precious stones to treat health issues. These practices are different from Western medicine because they're based on years of experience and intuition rather than scientific studies. This type of medicine is especially common in India, where a lot of people rely on it because it's easily available. However, there are concerns about the safety and quality of these medicines, especially with the growing use of herbal products worldwide. This has led to stricter manufacturing guidelines in India, but there's still work to be done to make sure these medicines are safe and effective"
Do you think it's worth exploring things like aromatherapy or Traditional Chinese Medicine to help with my stress?,"AIM: Attitudes and practice concerning complementary and alternative medicine  (CAM) are currently an area of considerable importance. However, little is known  about the overall importance of CAM in groups of health care professionals.  Therefore, the primary objective was to analyse the knowledge about and use of  CAM in an ethnically diverse student population at the London School of  Pharmacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to students (264 completed  questionnaires, response rate: 59.1%) and in-depth interviews were carried out  with a sample of seven students. RESULTS: Forty-three percent reported using at least one type of CAM during the  last 12 months. The types of CAM used that were most frequently mentioned  include aromatherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and medicinal  herbalism. TCM was reported by students of Chinese origin and by students from  other ethnic backgrounds. However, Ayurvedic (Indian) medicine and medicine from  Africa were only used in cultures from which the users originated. The study  shows that a large number of herbal medical products were commonly reported by  students of pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The knowledge about and use of CAM is widespread among this group of  future health care professionals and the students also expressed a strong  interest in the topic. In-depth studies on the knowledge and use of CAM among  other health care professionals and among ethnic minorities are urgently needed  and may help to better manage the treatment of minor disorders as well as  chronic diseases.","According to ""Knowledge and use of complementary and alternative medicine among British undergraduate pharmacy students"", a lot of pharmacy students in London are interested in and use alternative medicine. Around 43% said they'd used some form of alternative medicine in the past year, like essential oils (aromatherapy), Traditional Chinese Medicine, and herbal remedies. Students from different cultures tended to use the medicine typical to their background. So, there's a lot of interest in these non-traditional treatments among future health care pros, and more research is needed on how well they work and how they're used across different cultures and health care fields."
I've heard about Ashwagandha being used in traditional medicine. What benefits does it have and how can I tell if I'm getting a good quality product?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera L. (Solanaceae), commonly  known as Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng, is used in Ayurveda (Indian system of  traditional medicine) for vitality, cardio-protection and treating other  ailments, such as neurological disorders, gout, and skin diseases. AIM OF THE REVIEW: We present a critical overview of the information on the  metabolomics of W. somnifera and highlight the significance of the technique for  use in quality control of medicinal products. We have also pointed out the use  of metabolomics to distinguish varieties and to identify best methods of  cultivation, collection, as well as extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relevant information on medicinal value, phytochemical  studies, metabolomics of W. somnifera, and their applications were collected  from a rigorous electronic search through scientific databases, including  Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Structures of selected  metabolites were from the PubChem. RESULTS: The pharmacological activities of W. somnifera were well documented.  Roots are the most important parts of the plant used in Ayurvedic preparations.  Stem and leaves also have a rich content of bioactive phytochemicals like  steroidal lactones, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. Metabolomic studies revealed  that metabolite profiles of W. somnifera depended on plant parts collected and  the developmental stage of the plant, besides the season of sample collection  and geographical location. The levels of withanolides were variable, depending  on the morpho/chemotypes within the species of W. somnifera. Although studies on  W. somnifera were initiated several years ago, the complexity of secondary  metabolites was not realized due to the lack of adequate and fool-proof  technology for phytochemical fingerprinting. Sophistications in chromatography  coupled to mass spectrometry facilitated the discovery of several new  metabolites. Mutually complementary techniques like LC-MS, GC-MS, HPTLC, and NMR  were employed to obtain a comprehensive metabolomic profile. Subsequent data  analyses and searches against spectral databases enabled the annotation of  signals and dereplication of metabolites in several numbers without isolating  them individually. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides a critical update of metabolomic data  and the diverse application of the technique. The identification of parameters  for standardization and quality control of herbal products is essential to  facilitate mandatory checks for the purity of formulation. Such studies would  enable us to identify the best geographical location of plants and the time of  collection. We recommend the use of metabolomic analysis of herbal products  based on W. somnifera for quality control as well as the discovery of novel  bioactive compounds.","According to 'Metabolomics of Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal: Advances and applications', Ashwagandha, also known as Indian ginseng, is a plant that has been used in traditional Indian medicine for ages. It's known for boosting vitality and protecting the heart, among other things. The most potent parts of the plant are its roots, but its stem and leaves also contain beneficial compounds. However, the amount and kind of these beneficial compounds can vary depending on where the plant is grown, when it's harvested, and what part of the plant is used. That's why it's important to have proper quality checks for products made from Ashwagandha, to make sure they're pure and effective"
I've been feeling a bit off lately. Are there any natural remedies or lifestyle changes I can try before resorting to medication?,"Author information: (1)Abteilung Naturheilkunde, Departement Innere Medizin, Universitätsspital  Zürich, Schweiz. reinhard.saller@dim.usz.ch","According to 'Dyspeptic pain and phytotherapy--a review of traditional and modern herbal drugs', stomach pain can be eased using certain plants and herbs. This is a method that has been used both in old times and in modern medicine. So, maybe instead of always reaching for an over-the-counter remedy, try some natural alternatives like mint or ginger."
"I get kidney stones a lot, is there anything natural like Ayurvedic medicine that could help prevent them?","OBJECTIVE: To explore the supportive evidence for the use of Ayurvedic medicine  in the management of existing and recurrent nephrolithiasis. METHOD: Nine Ayurvedic medicines commonly utilized in the management of  nephrolithiasis were identified by discussions with Ayurvedic practitioners in  India. Mechanistic and clinical studies evaluating the use of these agents were  identified using the Medline database and bibliographies suggested by Ayurvedic  practitioners. The articles were then critically reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: Four in vitro mechanistic studies, eight animal studies, and seven  human trials were identified. Phyllanthus niruri has undergone mechanistic in  vitro, animal, and clinical trials that support its impact on calcium oxalate  crystallization. Preliminary clinical trials have evaluated the role of Dolichos  biflorus and Orthosiphon grandiflorus in the prevention of urolithiasis and fish  stone as a method of stone expulsion, yet the treatment effect and mechanism of  action remains to be elucidated. CONCLUSION: Ayurvedic medicine holds promise as a complementary approach to the  management and prevention of nephrolithiasis. The best studied compound is P.  niruri. Further controlled randomized clinical trials are justified to support  or refute the potential benefits demonstrated in these initial studies.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine and renal calculi', Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine from India, might be able to help with kidney stones. Some herbs used in Ayurveda, like Phyllanthus niruri, have been studied and show some promise in affecting the formation of these stones. Other herbs like Dolichos biflorus and Orthosiphon grandiflorus have been tested too, but we need more studies to understand how they work. So, Ayurveda could potentially be a useful addition to standard treatments for kidney stones. However, more research is needed to confirm these initial findings."
I've heard that some plants can help with urinary tract issues. Do you know which ones and why they might work?,"Elemental composition of some Ayurvedic medicinal plants used for healing  urinary tract disorders has been studied by nondestructive neutron activation  analysis with a 252Cf source and atomic absorption spectroscopy. In total, 14  elements have been estimated in different plants; among these Cu, Cr, Co and Cd  are found to be present at the trace level; Mn, Pb, Zn, Ni, Na, Fe and Hg at  minor level and K, Ca and Cl at major level. The differences in the  concentration of the elements are attributed to soil composition and the climate  in which the plant grows. The importance of some elements in diseases related to  renal disorders is also briefly discussed.","According to 'Mineral content of medicinal plants used in the treatment of diseases resulting from urinary tract disorders', some plants used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat urinary tract problems have been analyzed and found to contain 14 different minerals. These minerals are present at various levels, and some are just found in small amounts. What's cool is that the amount of these minerals in the plants can change depending on the soil and the weather where the plant grows. Some of these minerals might also play a role in kidney-related diseases."
I have high blood pressure and I'm a bit scared of the side effects of my meds. Are there any natural remedies or therapies I could try?,"OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and  alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with essential hypertension. METHOD: 521 consecutive patients visiting the Hypertension Clinic at the  Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India,  over a 6-month period were interviewed. Information was gathered on the  patients' demographics, type(s) of CAM used, sequence of seeking CAM and  conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons for opting for CAM and  areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM.  Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: It was observed that 63.9% of patients overall used CAM. Ayurveda was  the most commonly used CAM (56.7%), followed by herbal medicines (14.4%). The  most commonly cited reason by patients for using CAM was fear of adverse drug  reactions of conventional medicines (59.0%). However, more than half of the  patients eventually became dissatisfied using CAM. Only 5.4% of CAM users had  informed their medical doctors about the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients receiving conventional  treatment for hypertension also use CAM therapies. A better understanding of the  pattern of CAM use amongst these patients will help dispel prevalent  misconceptions concerning CAM and, at the same time, assist conventional  practitioners to critically evaluate possible gaps or omissions in their own  prescribing habits.","According to 'Prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in hypertensive patients of a tertiary care center in India', a lot of people with high blood pressure are using alternative treatments along with the regular medication they get from their doctor. The most popular ones are Ayurveda and herbal remedies. The main reason they turn to these methods is because they're worried about side effects from their regular drugs. However, more than half of them were not happy with the results from the alternative treatments. Interestingly, very few of these people told their doctors they were trying out these methods. So, if you're considering alternative treatments, it could be a good idea to discuss it with your doctor first."
I've got diabetes and recently started having foot ulcers. Would combining my insulin treatment with some Ayurvedic therapies help me feel better overall?,"The purpose of the study was to assess the health-related quality of life and  treatment satisfaction of diabetes patients (n = 36) with foot ulcers undergoing  insulin and ayurvedic adjunct therapy. Retrospective hospital based  cross-sectional design considered patients with diabetes foot ulcers undergoing  4-week treatment with insulin and ayurvedic combinatorial therapy. The Audit of  Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life Questionnaire and Diabetes Treatment  Satisfaction Questionnaire were completed for the assessment. The mean duration  of diabetes among participants was 9.32 ± 5.3 years. Assessment of Diabetes  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (total treatment satisfaction) score was  found to be 26.0139 ± 5.20369, and Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life  Questionnaire (average weighted impact) score was -3.0819 ± 1.83003.  Relationship with diabetes complications showed that Audit of Diabetes Dependent  Quality of Life Questionnaire score (P = .383) had no relationship, but Diabetes  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire score (P = .039) showed significance.  Integrated approaches for diabetes foot ulcer management with insulin and  ayurvedic management have a favorable impact on patient-perceived quality of  life.","According to 'Quality of life and treatment satisfaction observed among Indians with diabetes foot ulcers undergoing ayurvedic adjunct therapy', people with diabetes who have foot ulcers and who are being treated with both insulin and traditional Indian medicine seem to be pretty happy with their treatment. They've been living with diabetes for around 9 years on average, and this combined approach to treating their foot ulcers seems to be making a positive difference in their lives. The study didn't find any connection between how they're feeling and any other diabetes-related health problems they might have."
"I've been having some knee pain lately. Are there any natural remedies or treatments that might help, like stuff from traditional medicine?","BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common form of arthritis,  causing disability and impaired quality of life especially in the elderly. Sri  Lankan traditional medicine (STM) is widely used to treat OA, but no clinical  trial evaluated on STM regimens for KOA to discuss their safety and efficacy in  the treatment. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of  STM regimen for KOA in comparison to recommended conventional pain management  therapy over a period of 8 weeks on relieving the condition. STUDY DESIGN: This is a clinical trial following a protocol-driven open-labeled  randomized controlled study enrolling patients with KOA that will be conducted  as a single-center trial in the National Ayurveda Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka.  Rasnadvigunabhagasaya herbal decoction (RDBD) and an herbal pill Yoaraja Guggulu  were selected as the rescue medication for treating joint disorders. The two  Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs tab paracetamol and tab ibuprofen as the rescue  medication for their safety and efficacy. As test products for external  application, oil with an herbal fomentation-Kumburuetaperumkayam Pottani  (KAP)-and paste-Sandivadam Lepaya (SVL)-were selected. External applications  will be tested against the diclofenac sodium gel and hot water fomentation. KOA  patients will be allocated randomly into two arms, and the medications will be  given orally for 60 days and externally for 30 days. The primary endpoint is the  change in the score on the WOMAC after 08 weeks. WOMAC and KOOS will be recorded  and compared between the two arms prior to visiting 1, at the end of 15 days and  end of 30 days, and end of the 45 days and end of the second month and 3 months  of follow-up. KOOS and WOMAC subscales, a pain disability index, a visual analog  scale for pain and sleep quality, and a quality-of-life index are used as  secondary outcome measurements. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will be able to provide evidence-based  scientific data on Sri Lankan traditional medicine regimens in the management of  KOA. This trial is expected to develop capacity to scientifically evaluate  various STM that are claimed to have efficacy in treatment of various disease  conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN58050062 .","According to 'Efficacy and safety of Sri Lankan traditional medicine regimen for knee osteoarthritis: study protocol for an open-label, active comparator, randomized controlled trial', researchers are testing out Sri Lankan traditional medicine as a possible treatment for knee arthritis. They'll be comparing these traditional treatments, like herbal pills and decoctions and applying herbal oils and pastes, to usual pain relief methods like ibuprofen and paracetamol over two months. They're hoping to find out if these traditional methods are safe and if they can help improve the condition. This could lead to more options in treating knee arthritis in the future."
I've heard about this plant called Boerhavia diffusa that's supposed to be good for your health. What exactly does it do and is it really that beneficial?,"Boerhavia diffusa (BD) is a plant of rasayana category as per ayurvedic claims.  It is reported to possess antiaging, disease prevention, and life strengthening  activities which hold enormous influence in disease burden and  affordability/availability of healthcare in the world. Objective. This paper has  been compiled to comment on the studies reported for BD to highlight its  chemical and therapeutic potential along with its ethnopharmacological  considerations. METHODS: In the present paper, a detailed account of chemical constituents and  pharmacological activities has been presented. All the findings were correlated  with modern pharmacological activities to appraise the value of BD. RESULTS: Chemical analysis of BD gives a wide variety of chemical constituents,  namely, rotenoids, flavonoids, xanthones, purine nucleoside, lignans, and  steroids. Various ethnopharmacological reports emphasize its role in disorders  of reproductive system, gastrointestinal system, respiratory system, urinary  system, hepatic system/jaundice, cardiovascular system, and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The studies on the therapeutic activities of BD range from studies  on crude extracts to isolated compounds; however some of the studies require  sophistication and validated results. BD is a plant of enormous importance in  the purview of its chemical and therapeutic properties.","According to 'Phytochemical, therapeutic, and ethnopharmacological overview for a traditionally important herb: Boerhavia diffusa Linn.', the Boerhavia diffusa (BD) plant, which is a big deal in traditional medicine, is pretty awesome. It's known for slowing down aging, preventing diseases, and boosting your overall health. Scientists have found a bunch of different compounds in BD, like flavonoids and steroids, which are likely behind these health benefits. It's been used to help with everything from reproductive and digestive issues, to respiratory and heart problems, even cancer. So basically, BD is a superstar plant when it comes to its health benefits and chemical properties."
What are some traditional Indian beliefs about dealing with death and how can they help cope with the loss of a loved one?,"Medical ethics in the Indian context is closely related to indigenous classical  and folk traditions. This article traces the history of Indian conceptions of  ethics and medicine, with an emphasis on the Hindu tradition. Classical  Ayurvedic texts including Carakasamhita and Susrutasamhita provide foundational  assumptions about the body, the self, and gunas, which provide the underpinnings  for the ethical system. Karma, the notion that every action has consequences,  provides a foundation for medical morality. Conception, prolongation of one's  blood-line is an important ethical aim of life. Thus a wide range of practices  to further conception are acceptable. Abortion is a more complex matter  ethically. At the end of life death is viewed in the context of passage to  another life. Death is a relief from suffering to be coped with by the thought  of an eternal atman or rebirth.","According to 'Medical ethics in India', the way we think about medicine and ethics in India is heavily influenced by traditional beliefs and practices. Ancient texts like Carakasamhita and Susrutasamhita have shaped ideas about our bodies, who we are, and our characteristics. The concept of karma, or the idea that what goes around comes around, plays a big role in medical ethics. Having children is considered a big part of life, so people are pretty open to different ways of making that happen. Abortion, however, is a tricky subject with lots of ethical questions. When people die, it's thought of as a transition to the next life, which can be a comforting idea. The belief in an eternal soul or the"
I've been having trouble staying focused lately. Could these Ayurvedic herbal tablets help me improve my alertness?,"An ancient system of natural medicine--Maharishi Ayur-Vedic--prescribes certain  herbal formulas to enhance cognitive functioning, prevent illness, and alleviate  the detrimental effects of the aging process. A double-blind study was conducted  to test the effect of an Ayurvedic herbal preparation, Maharishi Amrit Kalash  (MAK), on an age-related alertness task. Forty-eight men over 35 years of age  were randomly assigned to receive MAK tablets or a closely matched placebo twice  daily for six weeks. A visual discrimination task consisted of the  identification of the exact location of a stimulus ""v"" within an array of x  symbols in tachistoscopic presentations. The MAK group improved significantly  more in their performance of this task after three and six weeks of treatment  relative to the placebo group. Performance was highly correlated with age, and  because successful performance apparently requires an unrestricted flow of  homogeneous attention as well as focalized concentration, it is concluded that  MAK may enhance attentional capacity or alertness, and thus reverse some of the  detrimental cognitive effects of aging.","According to 'Influence of a Maharishi Ayur-vedic herbal preparation on age-related visual discrimination', a study was done on an herbal mix called Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK) that's part of an old-school health system called Maharishi Ayur-Vedic. The study tested if this herbal mix could help with staying alert and focused, especially for older guys. The guys who took the MAK tablets got better at a specific visual task that required them to locate a certain symbol among many others, compared to those who took a placebo. So, the study suggests that MAK might help improve your focus and attention, and might even help counter some of the mental fuzziness that comes with getting older."
I've been thinking about trying some traditional Indian remedies for stress relief. But I heard some of them might contain heavy metals. Should I be worried about that?,"The growing popularity of traditional Indian remedies necessitates a critical  evaluation of risks associated with their use. This systematic review aims at  summarising all available data relating to the heavy metal content in such  remedies. Computerised literature searches were carried out to identify all  articles with original data on this subject. Fifteen case reports and six case  series were found. Their collective results suggest that heavy metals,  particularly lead, have been a regular constituent of traditional Indian  remedies. This has repeatedly caused serious harm to patients taking such  remedies. The incidence of heavy metal contamination is not known, but one study  shows that 64% of samples collected in India contained significant amounts of  lead (64% mercury, 41% arsenic and 9% cadmium). These findings should alert us  to the possibility of heavy metal content in traditional Indian remedies and  motivate us to consider means of protecting consumers from such risks.","According to 'Heavy metals in traditional Indian remedies', many traditional Indian remedies may have high levels of heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic. This can be harmful, especially if you're taking these remedies regularly. It's kind of like accidentally eating a bit of poison with your food - definitely not good for you! So, if you're considering using these remedies, make sure you're aware of these risks and maybe look for safer alternatives."
"Is the bark of this Alstonia scholaris tree any good for treating malaria or other illnesses, you think?","The petroleum either extract and methanol extract of the bark of Alstonia  scholaris were found to be devoid of antiamalarial activity in mice infected  with Plasmodium berghei. However, a dose-dependent improvement of conditions and  delayed mortality amongst animals receiving methanol extract of A. scholaris was  noticed. Studies with A. constricta and alstonine shall help resolve the  antimalarial status of the bark in question.","According to 'Preliminary evaluation of extracts of Alstonia scholaris bark for in vivo antimalarial activity in mice', scientists tested two different types of extracts from the bark of the Alstonia scholaris tree on mice with malaria. It turns out, neither of the extracts were able to cure the disease. However, one of the extracts did seem to make the sick mice feel a bit better and live a little longer. More research will be done to see if other related plants or different parts of the tree might have anti-malaria properties."
I heard that high cholesterol can lead to heart disease. Are there any natural herbs I could take to help lower it?,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of morbidity and  mortality in both developing and developed countries. An underlying cause of IHD  involves retention and deposit of serum lipids in coronary arteries, decreasing  blood flow. Drugs (conventional and herbal) are used to lower levels of serum  cholesterol to help prevent IHD. The Ayurvedic medicine pharmacopoeia identified  herbs that might contribute to a decrease in cholesterol and therefore reduce  the risk of IHD. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted at 3 points: 2003, 2004, and 2007.  Databases searched included PubMed, the National Library of Medicine, the  National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Ovid, and EBSCO  Information Services, and other search strategies also were used. Each article  was assessed for quality by 3 people, and discrepancies were resolved by  arbitration using a fourth person, who also read and scored each article.  Additional assessments of safety using a scale and determination of reported  efficacy/effectiveness of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and  quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) were made. RESULTS: RCTs generally received high quality scores and improved by decade of  publication. More than 50% of garlic, more than 80% of guggul, and 100% of  Arjuna RCTs reported product effectiveness. Safety scores did not improve by  decade. The QEDs received medium and high quality scores, and 93% of them  reported effectiveness. The QEDs had a higher mean score for safety reporting  than the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies received high quality scores and noted safety  information and reported effectiveness or efficacy in a clear manner. This  finding was not consistent with other systematic reviews that have found the  highest reported efficacy/ effectiveness in studies of poorer quality. Ayurvedic  herbs reviewed here should be considered by physicians when trying to manage  hyperlipidemia in their patients.","According to 'Ayurvedic and collateral herbal treatments for hyperlipidemia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs', heart problems can be caused by too much fat in your blood slowing down your blood flow. This is often treated with drugs, but some herbs used in traditional Indian medicine might be able to lower your blood fat levels too. The research found that garlic, guggul, and Arjuna were all effective in doing this. So if you're worried about heart disease, you might want to talk to your doctor about including these herbs in your health routine."
I've been feeling a bit off lately. Could it be something related to my environment or work conditions?,"Author information: (1)1 Arbeits- und Umweltmedizin, Institut für Epidemiologie, Biostatistik und  Prävention (EBPI), Universität Zürich. (2)2 Klinik und Poliklinik für Innere Medizin, Universitätsspital Zürich.","According to 'Abdominal pain, constipation and anemia', if you're frequently experiencing stomach pain, having trouble going to the bathroom, and feeling super tired, you might be dealing with something more serious than just a bad day.

"I've been dealing with bleeding hemorrhoids, do you know any natural remedies that might help?",The results of the clinical assessment of a multiherbal indigenous formulation  on 22 patients with bleeding piles are reported.,"According to 'Efficacy of an indigenous formulation in patients with bleeding piles: a preliminary clinical study', a natural herbal remedy was tested on 22 people who were dealing with bleeding hemorrhoids. The researchers found that it had a positive effect, so if you're having similar issues, this kind of treatment might help."
I've heard that other cultures have different ways of dealing with mental health. Can you tell me more about how they approach it?,"Biomedical knowledge underlies the science of all national systems of psychiatry  and is integral to international psychiatry. It is grounded in Western systems  of thought, values, and world views. In assessing the cultural and national  presuppositions of contemporary psychiatry, it is desirable to analyze other  systems of practice. In this article, some of the characteristics of ancient,  non-Western traditions of mental health and approaches to mental illness are  discussed. In reviewing salient characteristics of the approach to mental health  and illness of India and China, one is provided with a vivid illustration of the  interplay between culture and a system of psychiatric practice. The secular and  essentially impersonal features of modern biomedical psychiatry contrast with  the spiritual, value-laden, but also naturalistic basis of ancient traditions  and approaches to mental health and illness.","According to 'Mental health and illness in traditional India and China', the way we see and treat mental health in the West is not the only way. Other cultures, like those in India and China, have been handling mental health differently, using their own beliefs and traditions. Today's psychiatry is very science-based and impersonal, while older methods were more spiritual and personalized. Studying these older methods can help us understand the relationship between culture and how we treat mental health."
"So, I heard that some plants can help fight against tuberculosis. Is there any truth to this? Can you recommend any specific ones?","It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is infected with  tubercle bacillus and the problem of tuberculosis (TB) has been intensified due  to HIV pandemic providing a large reservoir of highly susceptible individuals.  Since no anti-TB drugs have been introduced in past 30 years, there is an urgent  need to search for and develop new, effective and affordable anti-TB drugs. In  this scenario, the plant kingdom with enormous chemical diversity may be looked  as an important source of new anti-TB agents. Of 17,500 higher plant species  occurring in India only about 365 species have been evaluated so far for  antimycobacterial activity. The present review article describes the 255 (70% of  365) plant species from a wide range of families that have shown  antimycobacterial activity. The species are enumerated in table format  describing plant species and family, plant part used, type of extract and in  vitro activity (MIC value), information on active compounds, if any, and uses in  the ethnomedicine and Ayurveda. Interestingly, most of the plant species have  shown strong positive ethnopharmacological correlation with the traditional  knowledge. In addition, the recent in vitro screening methods for  antimycobacterial activity are also described in brief. An attempt has been made  to highlight the promising plant species for further investigation as leads for  drug development.","According to the 'Indian medicinal plants as a source of antimycobacterial agents', there's a major need for new medicine to combat tuberculosis (TB). One place we could find these is in Indian plants, which are super diverse and mostly unexplored for their potential to fight TB. Of the thousands of plant species in India, only about 365 have been checked out for this purpose, and about 70% of those showed promising results. What's cool is that a lot of these plants are already used in traditional medicine, so it seems like we're on the right track. This research could be a game changer in finding affordable and effective new TB treatments."
I've heard about this ayurvedic thing called Septilin that's supposed to be good for infections. Does it really work and what does it do exactly?,"Effect of Septilin, an ayurvedic formulation proven to be effective in the  therapy of chronic infections, was investigated on the phagocytic system and  humoral response in rats and mice. Septilin exhibited significant protection in  E. coli-induced abdominal sepsis in normal mice and in Staphylococcus  aureus-induced sepsis in neutropenic mice. It significantly reduced the viable  E. coli cells when incubated with neutrophils in rats. Septilin stimulated the  phagocytic function of the reticuloendothelial system in mice. In normal rats,  Septilin enhanced anti-SRBC hemagglutination antibody titre by 5.7-fold and  showed significant protection in cyclophosphamide-induced humoral suppression.","According to 'Immunotherapeutic modification by an ayurvedic formulation Septilin', Septilin, an Ayurvedic medicine, has been found to be really good at fighting chronic infections. It was tested on rats and mice, and it helped their bodies fend off E.coli and Staph infections. It also boosted their immune system and made their bodies stronger against other diseases. This could be an interesting natural alternative to consider if you're dealing with a persistent infection that doesn't seem to want to go away."
I've heard that some plants can be used for health benefits. Can this Catharanthus roseus plant be used to treat common health problems like diabetes or even something as serious as cancer?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don is a well known  medicinal plant belonging to family Apocynaceae that have been traditionally  used as medicine since ancient times. C. roseus is a well-recognized herbal  medicine due to its anticancer bisindole alkaloids (vinblastine (111),  vincristine (112) and vindesine (121)). In the Ayurvedic system of medicine,  different parts of C. roseus are used in folklore herbal medicine for treatment  of many types of cancer, diabetes, stomach disorders, kidney, liver and  cardiovascular diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main idea behind this communication is to update  comprehensively and analyze critically the traditional applications,  phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and toxicity of various extracts and  isolated compounds from C. roseus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presented data covers scientific works on C. roseus  published across the world between 1967 and 2021 was searched from various  international publishing houses using search engines as well as several  traditional texts like Ayurveda and relevant books. Collected data from  different sources was comprehensively summarized/analyzed for ethnomedicinal  uses, phytochemistry, analytical chemistry, biological activities and toxicity  studies of C. roseus. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: C. roseus has a wide range of applications in the  traditional system of medicine especially in cancer and diabetes. During  phytochemical investigation, total of 344 compounds including monoterpene indole  alkaloids (MIAs) (110), bisindole alkaloids (35), flavonoids (34), phenolic  acids (9) and volatile constituents (156) have been reported in the various  extracts and fractions of different plant parts of C. roseus. The extracts and  isolated compounds of C. roseus have to exhibit many pharmacological activities  such as anticancer/cytotoxic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antioxidant,  larvicidal and pupicidal. The comparative toxicity of extracts and bioactive  compounds investigated in dose dependent manner. The investigation of toxicity  showed that the both extracts and isolated compounds are safe to a certain limit  beyond that they cause adverse effects. CONCLUSION: This review is a comprehensive, critically analyzed summarization of  sufficient baseline information of selected topics in one place undertaken till  date on C. roseus for future works and drug discovery. The phytochemical  investigation including biosynthetic pathways showed that the MIAs and bisindole  alkaloids are major and characteristic class of compounds in this plant. The  present data confirm that the extracts/fractions and their isolated alkaloids  especially vinblastine (111) and vincristine (112) have a potent  anticancer/cytotoxic and antidiabetic property and there is a need for further  study with particular attention to the mechanisms of anticancer activity. In  biosynthesis pathways of alkaloids especially bisindole alkaloids, some enzymes  and rearrangement are unexposed therefore it is required to draw special  attention. It also focuses on attracting the attention of scientific communities  about the widespread biological activities of this species for its better  utilization prospects in the near future.","According to 'Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don: A review of its ethnobotany, phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology and toxicities', the Catharanthus roseus plant, often known as the Madagascar periwinkle, is pretty amazing. It's been used in traditional medicine for ages to treat a number of conditions, especially cancer and diabetes. Scientists have discovered over 300 compounds in this plant, including a couple of key ones like vinblastine and vincristine that are really good at fighting cancer. But, just like anything, too much of it can be harmful. There's still a lot we don't know about how these compounds work, so more research is needed. But, it's"
I've heard about Ayurvedic treatments recently. Can they actually help slow down kidney disease progression?,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ayurvedic  treatment on deceleration of the disease progress of nondialysis patients with  stage IV or V chronic renal failure (CRF). Materials and Methods: A complex oral  and proctocolonic Ayurvedic multiherbal medication was administered daily for 1  month to inpatients. Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral  medication for additional 5 months. Four renal function tests (RFTs) were  evaluated at various time points (TPs): (1) 6 months before baseline (TP -6),  (2) at baseline (TP 0), and (3) after completion of 6 months of treatment (TP  +6). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse-Geisser  correction and Friedman's ANOVA by ranks were used to analyze the RFTs. For post  hoc tests, the Bonferroni correction was applied. Bias-corrected effect sizes  (Hedges) for the treatment were calculated. Results: Sixty-four nondialysis CRF  patients with laboratory investigations of the preceding 6 months were included;  12 patients discontinued the treatment. Fifty-two patients with stage IV or V at  baseline completed the study. Mean concentrations of estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and hemoglobin differed significantly  between TPs (eGFR: F = 15.3, p < 0.001; serum creatinine: F = 29.3, p < 0.001;  blood urea: F = 2.0, p = 0.159; hemoglobin: F = 53.9, p < 0.001). Pairwise  comparisons of the mean differences between TPs are significant for eGFR,  creatinine, and hemoglobin. For blood urea, a significant decrease was observed  for the treatment period [15.9(↓) mg/dL, standard error 4.0; n = 52], but a  nonsignificant increase was observed for the pretreatment period [16.2(↑) mg/dL,  standard error 9.8] due to insufficient data for TP -6 (n = 26). The effect  sizes for eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin were medium (0.45, 0.53,  0.44, and 0.30). Conclusions: After 6 months of treatment, statistically and  clinically significant improvements of eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and  hemoglobin and a significant shift to better CRF stages were observed. Several  cardinal symptoms were also significantly reduced. Randomized controlled trials  are warranted to evaluate the effects in comparison to usual care.","According to 'Deceleration of Disease Progress Through Ayurvedic Treatment in Nondialysis Stages IV-V Patients with Chronic Renal Failure', the study found that a 6-month treatment using Ayurvedic herbal medicine helped people with advanced kidney disease. The treatment improved things like kidney function and blood health. It even seemed to slow down the disease's progress. However, the study suggests that more research is needed to compare this method to typical treatments. So, Ayurveda - an ancient Indian system of medicine - might be something to consider if you're dealing with kidney problems."
"I've heard about these plant doctors in India, what kind of health issues do they treat?","Despite decades of research on India's plural health care market, the practices  of many local health traditions outside the allopathic and codified traditions  are under-studied. Drawing on interview and observational data, this paper  explores the space in which indigenous traditional Khasi healers in Meghalaya  state, northeast India, practice. Khasi indigenous healers describe themselves  as doktor sla, plant doctors, to distinguish themselves from doktor kot, or book  doctors. This distinction operates as a rhetorical resource, utilised to carve a  distinct sphere of expertise in relation to the allopathic sector, and to mark  claims for the specifically local appropriateness of traditional practices  within a shifting market of state-sponsored provision. Khasi healers are a  heterogeneous group who treat a wide variety of conditions, including physical  ailments which have no obvious correlates in biomedical systems, and  musculoskeletal disorders, with which they have recognised expertise. In  addition to claiming these discrete strengths, healers also present themselves  as accommodating deficiencies in biomedicine, including inherent generic  weaknesses of allopathic care as well as specific local gaps in rural health  care provision. Thus, the expertise niches of traditional healers have evolved  through their interactions with, and the needs of, the community, but also  through managing a shifting boundary with biomedical practitioners, who are  explicitly sceptical of their efficacy, but tacitly accepting of the ways in  which they manage the gaps in biomedical provision. While codified  non-biomedical traditions in India have engaged in universalising  professionalising projects, in this setting at least, non-codified practitioners  have instead utilised discourses of localism.","According to 'Doktor Kot, Doktor Sla - book doctors, plant doctors and the segmentation of the medical market place in Meghalaya, northeast India', traditional healers in northeast India, called Khasi healers, use plants to treat a range of health issues. They call themselves ""plant doctors"", to set themselves apart from regular doctors, who they call ""book doctors"". While some people are doubtful about their methods, they fill in gaps in the healthcare system, particularly in rural areas. They also claim to be better in some ways at treating certain health problems, especially those related to muscles and bones. They're pretty proud of their local knowledge and expertise and don't try to fit into the more mainstream medical world."
I've heard that some medicines are being made from natural products now. Are they any safer or more efficient than regular drugs?,"The pharmaceutical industry is facing serious challenges as the drug discovery  process is becoming extremely expensive, riskier and critically inefficient. A  significant shift from single to multi targeted drugs especially for polygenic  syndromes is being witnessed. Strategic options based on natural product drug  discovery, ethnopharmacology and traditional medicines are re-emerging to offer  good base as an attractive discovery engine. Approaches based on reverse  pharmacology may offer efficient development platforms for herbal formulations.  Relevant case studies from India and other countries where such approaches have  expedited the drug discovery and development process by reducing time and  economizing investments with better safety are discussed.","According to 'Natural products drug discovery: accelerating the clinical candidate development using reverse pharmacology approaches', the process of discovering new drugs is getting pretty difficult and expensive. A lot of drug companies are now looking at multiple targets for treating diseases, especially ones caused by many genes. They're also going back to more natural methods like using plants and traditional medicines to help find new drugs. There's also a new approach called reverse pharmacology that could make creating new drugs from herbs more efficient. They've seen some success with this in India and other countries, where it's saved time and money and made safer drugs."
"I've heard that some herbs can help with diabetes. Is there any truth to that and if so, which herbs should I be looking at?","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and synthesize the evidence on the effect of Ayurvedic  therapies for diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Systematic review of trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a  system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic  treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles  in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching  journals in India were examined, yielding 54 articles reporting the results of  62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and  Eugenia jambolana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush-82 and  D-400 were most often studied. Thirty-five of the studies included came from the  Western literature, 27 from the Indian. Seven were randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) and 10 controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or natural experiments.  Twenty-two studies went on to further analysis based on a set of criteria. Of  these, 10 were RCTs, CCTs, or natural experiments, 12 were case series or cohort  studies. There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil,  fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 have a  glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study. Evidence of effectiveness of  several other herbs is less extensive (C tamala, E jambolana, and Momordica  charantia). CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in the available literature on Ayurvedic  treatment for diabetes. Most studies test herbal therapy. Heterogeneity exists  in the herbs and formulas tested (more than 44 different interventions  identified) and in the method of their preparation. Despite these limitations,  there are sufficient data for several herbs or herbal formulas to warrant  further studies.","According to 'Are Ayurvedic herbs for diabetes effective?', researchers looked at a bunch of studies to figure out if certain Ayurvedic treatments, especially herbal ones, could help with diabetes. They checked out over 1300 articles and ended up focusing on 54 of them. The most commonly studied plants were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and Eugenia jambolana, and a couple of herbal mixes named Ayush-82 and D-400. The verdict? There's a good sign that these herbs and mixtures might help lower blood sugar levels, so they're worth looking into more. There were a few other herbs that also showed promise, but the evidence wasn't as strong. The research did"
I've been taking some natural Ayurvedic medicine lately and feeling kinda weird. Could it have anything to do with it?,"INTRODUCTION: Lead poisoning is most commonly caused by occupational exposure.  It presents with a myriad of signs and symptoms ranging from mild anemia to  frank encephalopathy, depending on the blood lead levels as well as the duration  of exposure. Intake of herbal/Ayurvedic medicine may also lead to plumbism as  heavy metals are often incorporated in such medications with the belief that  such metals have medicinal properties. METHODS: We report a case of lead poisoning caused by Ayurvedic medication. The  patient presented with symptoms of intestinal obstruction to the surgical  casualty. RESULTS: The patient presented with symptoms that mimicked intestinal  obstruction. No specific etiology could be determined. Serum lead levels were  determined and diagnosis of lead poisoning ascertained. The lead content of the  medicine was analyzed and it contained 30% w/w lead. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning consequent to intake of  alternative medicine must be kept in mind when a patient presents with vague  complaints.","According to 'Lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic drug presenting as intestinal obstruction: a case report', taking herbal or Ayurvedic medicine can sometimes lead to lead poisoning. This is because these types of medicines often contain heavy metals like lead, which some people believe have healing properties. The lead in the medicine can make you feel really sick and cause symptoms that can be mistaken for other health problems. So if you're feeling unwell and you can't figure out why, it might be a good idea to check if any alternative medicines you're taking contain heavy metals."
"So, I've heard that D. biflorus seeds can help prevent kidney stones. Do they work straight away or do they lose their effectiveness over time?","In vitro effect of D. biflorus seeds on crystallization of calcium phosphate, a  major constituent of kidney stone has been undertaken. There was a marked  decrease in anticalcifying activity with the maturation of seeds or post-harvest  storage for 6 months. The results suggested that the inhibitors of  crystallization present in seed extract of D. biflorus were water soluble, heat  stable, polar, non-tannin and non-protein in nature. There were two or more  different inhibitors of calcium phosphate precipitation since both the dialysate  and the dialysed fractions contained inhibitory activity, though it was more in  the dialysed fractions. The anticalcifying activity was lost completely with  activated charcoal which was not recovered or eluted by any solvent tried.","According to 'Anticalcifying properties of Dolichos biflorus (horse gram) seeds', horse gram seeds could potentially help in preventing kidney stones. However, the potency of the seeds seems to decrease as they mature or are stored for a long time after being harvested. The compounds in the seeds that prevent the formation of kidney stones are water-soluble, can withstand heat, and are not made of certain types of proteins or plant compounds. Interestingly, there seem to be multiple types of these compounds in the seeds. However, these beneficial effects are lost when the seeds are treated with activated charcoal. So, it might be worth adding some fresh horse gram to your diet if you're looking to keep kidney stones at bay!"
I've heard that using a tongue scraper could help with digestion and oral health. Is there any truth to this?,"OBJECTIVES: The effect of tongue cleaning on digestive power is mentioned in  Ayurvedic information sources. However, no study has yet evaluated this. We  aimed to evaluate the effects of tongue cleaning on digestive power from  Ayurvedic viewpoint, and on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in  healthy adults. DESIGN: Randomized cross-over. INTERVENTIONS: We recruited healthy adults aged 20-60 years. After  randomization, the immediate intervention group started tongue cleaning with a  tongue scraper every morning for 4 weeks, and then waited for 4 weeks. The  delayed intervention group initially waited for 4 weeks, and then started tongue  cleaning in the same way. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the outcomes using the questionnaire on  digestive power from Ayurvedic viewpoint, and the General Oral Health Assessment  Index for OHRQoL. We estimated the effects of tongue cleaning using generalized  estimating equations (GEE). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, by  comparing the changes in outcomes during the first 4 weeks of both groups. RESULTS: Of 58 participants, 57 completed the study. In GEE analysis, tongue  cleaning showed improvement in some components of Ayurvedic digestive power  represented by fecal and body conditions. For example, the odds ratio for  improvement of constipation was 2.80 (95% CI: 1.04-7.58). The General Oral  Health Assessment Index score was significantly increased by 4.33 points (95%  CI: 2.18-6.48) after tongue cleaning. In sensitivity analyses, the trends of the  results were similar to the main GEE analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Tongue cleaning may be an effective method to improve digestive  power and OHRQoL.","According to 'Effects of tongue cleaning on Ayurvedic digestive power and oral health-related quality of life: A randomized cross-over study', cleaning your tongue every morning might actually help you digest food better and improve your oral health. They saw that people who scraped their tongue every morning for a month were less likely to be constipated and overall felt better about their oral health. So, it might be a good idea to add tongue cleaning to your morning routine!"
I've been taking some traditional Indian medicine lately and I've been feeling kinda off. Could it have anything to do with that?,"BACKGROUND: Millions worldwide use Ayurvedic (traditional Indian) medicines.  These medications are increasingly associated with lead poisoning, often  accompanied by anemia. We compared the relative hematopoietic toxicity of  Ayurvedic lead poisoning with a common form of occupational lead poisoning. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively studied 66 adult lead intoxications: 43  published Ayurvedic cases identified in published reports by searching MEDLINE  (1966 to November 2005); 4 Ayurvedic patients seen at a referral center; and 19  lead paint intoxications from the same center. We considered patients' age,  gender and blood lead at presentation, and then compared the groups with respect  to hematopoietic parameters. RESULTS: Ayurvedic lead poisoning was associated with higher blood lead  (p<0.001), more basophilic stippling (p<0.001), lower hemoglobin (p<0.001) and  higher protoporphyrin (p<0.001). Multiple regression adjusted for blood lead and  gender found Ayurvedic lead poisoning associated with a 36.2 g/L (95% CI -48.8,  -23.6 g/L) greater decrement in hemoglobin (p<0.001) as compared to  paint-removal poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic poisoning produces greater hematopoietic toxicity than  paint-removal poisoning. Ayurvedic ingestion should be considered in patients  with anemia. Ayurveda users should be screened for lead exposure and strongly  encouraged to discontinue metal-containing remedies.","According to 'Hematopoietic toxicity from lead-containing Ayurvedic medications', traditional Indian medicines, known as Ayurvedic medicines, are being linked to lead poisoning which can make you really sick. The research found that this type of lead poisoning is worse than the kind you might get from being around too much lead paint. It can lower your blood's hemoglobin levels, which are important for carrying oxygen around your body. So, if you're using Ayurvedic medicines and feeling sick or weak, you should get checked out for lead exposure. It might be best to stop using any Ayurvedic remedies that contain metals."
I've been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety lately. Are there any natural therapies or routines that could help me feel better?,"Treatments offered at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway are based  on Maharishi Vedic Medicine (MVM). MVM is a consciousness-based revival by  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program  of the ancient Ayurvedic medicine tradition in India. To extend from 6 to 24  months, a pilot study of the effects of the treatment program at the Health  Centre on fibromyalgia. Retesting 2 years after a clinical trial. In this  intention to treat study, 31 women with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia received an  individually tailored program of (1) physiological purification therapy  (Maharishi Panchakarma) and (2) Ayurvedic recommendations regarding daily  routine and diet including a novel approach to food intolerance. Five subjects  chose to learn TM for stress reduction, pain management and personal  development. All were recommended Ayurvedic herbal products for follow-up  treatment. A modified Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) that included  seven dimensions. Scores at 24 months follow-up were compared with pre-treatment  scores. At 24-months follow-up, there were significant reductions (26% to 44%)  in six of the seven fibromyalgia dimensions: impairment of working ability,  pain, tiredness, morning tiredness, stiffness and anxiety. The 7th, depression,  decreased 32% (borderline significant). At 24 months, the four subjects who  continued practising TM, had almost no symptoms and significantly lower FIQ  change scores (-92% to 97%) than the non-meditators on all outcomes. This pilot  study suggests that the treatments and health promotion programs offered at the  Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway lead to long-term reductions in  symptoms of fibromyalgia, which is considered a treatment-resistant condition,  and further studies are warranted.","According to the study 'Treatment of fibromyalgia at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway II--a 24-month follow-up pilot study', a health center in Norway is using an old Indian health practice to help treat fibromyalgia, which is a condition that causes pain and tiredness. They tailor the treatment to each person, which includes a special diet, stress reduction techniques, and herbal products. Some people also learned Transcendental Meditation. Two years later, the people who took part in the study felt a lot better, especially those who continued with the meditation. This suggests that this type of treatment could really help people with fibromyalgia. More research is needed, but it's a promising start."
I've heard about cinnabar being used in traditional Chinese medicine. Is it safe to use or could it be toxic if I take too much?,"Cinnabar is an attractive mineral with many different uses. It is reported that  cinnabar is one of the traditional Chinese's medicines extensively use. The main  objective of this critical review is to identify the current overview, concept  and chemistry of cinnabar, which includes the process developments, challenges,  and diverse options for pharmacology research. It is used as a medicine through  probable toxicity, especially when taking overdoes. This review is the first to  describe the toxicological effects of cinnabar and its associated compounds.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) dependent metabolomics could be useful for  examination of the pharmaceutical consequence. The analysis indicated that the  accurate preparation methods, appropriate doses, disease status, ages with drug  combinations are significant factors for impacting the cinnabar toxicity.  Toxicologically, synthetic mercury sulfide or cinnabar should be notable for  mercuric chloride, mercury vapor and methyl mercury for future protection and  need several prominent advancements in cinnabar research.","According to 'New insights and rethinking of cinnabar for chemical and its pharmacological dynamics', cinnabar is a type of mineral that's often used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, just like any other medicine, if you take too much of it, it can be harmful. It's important to take the right dose and to prepare it correctly. The study also suggests that factors such as age and whether you're taking it with other meds can also affect how toxic it can be. To make this medicine safer in the future, more research is needed, especially in understanding its toxic effects."
"I've heard about this Ashwagandha stuff used in traditional medicine, could it potentially help in treating cancer or inflammation?","Despite the recent successes of targeted cancer immuno-therapies, drug  resistance and disease relapse remain a huge burden in cancer patient treatment.  This has fueled renewed interest in natural product discovery to identify new  pharmacophores for innovative cancer drug development. Reverse pharmacology  approaches of Withania somnifera leaves and roots (alternatively also called  Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng in traditional Ayurvedic and Unani folk medicine)  have identified Withaferin A (WA) as the most bioactive compound for treatment  of inflammatory ailments, supporting traditional use of their corresponding  extracts in indigenous medicine. In this review we summarize preclinical in vivo  evidence for therapeutic cancer applications of WA and provide a biochemical  framework of its polypharmaceutical effects against cancer hallmarks.","According to 'Withaferin A: From ayurvedic folk medicine to preclinical anti-cancer drug', researchers are looking at natural remedies to help find new treatments for cancer. They're particularly interested in a plant called Ashwagandha, which is used in traditional Indian medicine. This plant contains a compound called Withaferin A that might be really good at fighting cancer. There's still a lot of testing to be done, but this could be a big step forward in developing new cancer drugs."
I'm thinking about studying abroad in India. Is it hard to find reliable doctors and healthcare there?,"The maldistribution of biomedical services creates a dilemma for Indian  patients. They encounter a bewildering array of medical services, ranging from  qualified traditional medical practitioners to untrained, self-taught purveyors  of medicines and cures. Research on Indian healthcare has decried the  inefficient distribution of services in rural and urban areas. The studies  discussed here reveal the ground reality of the consequences of limited choices  for patients, characterised as ""forced pluralism,"" with no state regulation of  type of care, quality of care, or credentials of practitioners.","According to 'Medical pluralism in India: patient choice or no other options?', healthcare in India is quite chaotic. There's a mix of trained doctors and self-taught people selling medicine and offering treatments. The issue is, these services are not evenly available across the country. There's basically no rules or regulations about who can provide care, what kind of care they can provide, or even if they're qualified. This means patients often don't have great options and are forced to use whatever healthcare is available, whether it's good or not."
I've been struggling with slow digestion. Could a natural remedy like Terminalia chebula help get things moving more quickly?,"Terminalia chebula is a commonly advocated agent in Ayurveda for improving  gastrointestinal motility. Charles Foster rats (150-200 gms of either sex) were  divided into four groups as follows--Group 1 (n = 15) normal animals; Group II  (n = 6) rats administered metoclopramide (1.35 mg/kg); Group III (n = 8) rats  given atropine (0.45 mg/kg). These agents were injected intramuscularly, 30 mins  before the experiment. Rats from Group IV (n = 8) were administered Terminalia  chebula (100 mg/kg/day for 15 days orally). Metoclopramide and atropine have  established prokinetic and antikinetic activities respectively and are therefore  included for comparison. All rats were then given a test meal of methyl  cellulose (1.5%) mixed with phenol red (50 mg/100 ml) orally and gastric  emptying was measured 20 mins later. Gastric emptying of normal rats (Group I)  was found to be 51.6 +/- 7.79%. Metoclopramide significantly increased the  gastric emptying (76.33 +/- 12.37%; p < 0.01) and atropine inhibited the  motility (% gastric emptying being 7.26 +/- 19.76%; p < 0.01). Terminalia  chebula was found to increase the percent gastric emptying (86.57 +/- 6.65%; p <  0.01). Thus from this study it appears that Terminalia chebula can serve as an  useful alternative to prokinetic drugs available today.","According to 'Effect of oral administration of Terminalia chebula on gastric emptying: an experimental study', a plant called Terminalia chebula, often used in Ayurvedic medicine, might be really good for your digestion. In a study with rats, they found out that it helped food move through the stomach faster. In fact, it worked even better than some common drugs used for the same purpose. So, if you're having tummy troubles, Terminalia chebula might be worth a try."
"I've heard about this ""Umami substance"" thing, could that actually make my food taste better and be healthier for me?","The principal objective of this paper is to demonstrate the role of taste and  flavor in health from the ancient science of Ayurveda to modern medicine;  specifically their mechanisms and roles in space medicine and their clinical  relevance in modern heath care. It also describes the brief history of the use  of the monosodium glutamate or flavor enhancers (""Umami substance"") that improve  the quality of food intake by stimulating chemosensory perception. In addition,  the dietary nucleotides are known to be the components of ""Umami substance"" and  the benefit of their use has been proposed in various types of patients with  cancer, radiation therapy, organ transplantation, and for application in space  medicine.","According to 'Application of diet-derived taste active components for clinical nutrition: perspectives from ancient Ayurvedic medical science, space medicine, and modern clinical nutrition', what we taste and how food tastes can actually have a big impact on our health. From Ayurvedic principles to space medicine and modern healthcare, taste plays a key role. The paper also talks about monosodium glutamate or MSG (you might have heard of it as ""umami"" flavor), which can make food more appealing to us. Plus, they discuss something called dietary nucleotides, which are part of that ""umami"" flavor and might have health benefits. These could even help patients dealing with cancer, radiation therapy, organ transplants, or astronauts in space. So"
"I've been hearing about this ""Lauhasava"" thing for anemia. Does it have any side effects I should know about?","In this study, the pharmacological and toxicological effects along with possible  side effects of the classical ayurvedic formulation ""Lauhasava"" (LSV), which is  used in anemia, were evaluated. During this study, various experiments on body  growth rate, organ-body weight ratio, tissue hydration indices and body fat  ratio were performed to evaluate its efficacy and toxicity. In the body weight  study, the LSV treated rats, irrespective of sexes, showed significantly lower  body weights than the control group rats. LSV treated mice of both sexes gained  less weight than their control counterparts. The study involving comparison of  the relative weights of the major organs of rats and mice revealed some  significant results. The percentage of lung to the body weight is significantly  increased in both sexes of rats. Liver weight in LSV treated rats of both sexes  were observed to be increased. The percentage of kidney weight was increased in  both sexes of rats, the result being significant in the case of female rats. The  thymus weight was found significantly decreased in both sexes of rats.  Significant increase in the weight of rats' ovaries was observed. In the tissue  hydration index experiment, only the increase in the female kidney was  significant. No significant result was found in the fat content of the whole  mice and eviscerated mice.","According to 'Pharmacological and toxicological studies of an ayurvedic formulation (""Lauhasava"") on the biological system of rats and mice', this traditional medicine called ""Lauhasava"" that people use for anemia might have some side effects. The research found that rats and mice that were given Lauhasava actually ended up weighing less than those who weren't given the medicine. Not only that, but there were also changes in the weights of some of their organs, like their lungs, liver, kidneys, thymus, and ovaries. In particular, the kidneys in female rats showed a significant increase in weight. So, while this medicine might help with anemia, there might be other effects on your body weight and"
