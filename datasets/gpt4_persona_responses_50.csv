0,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive, natural health care system that originated in the  ancient Vedic times of India. Epigenetics refers to the external modification of  DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without  changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have  transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are  lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors.  Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti  (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and  indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus,  it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This  correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and  understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of  both sciences in the management of optimal health. In addition, research on  Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will further increase correlation  and understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda.",Can Ayurvedic practices influence our genes and improve overall health?,Can changing my lifestyle or diet with Ayurveda methods affect my genes and improve my overall health?,Can Ayurveda practices like changing my diet or reducing stress help improve my health by influencing my genes?,"According to ""Understanding 'corresponding to phenotype and genotype': epigenetics and Ayurveda"", Ayurvedic practices can influence gene expression without altering the DNA structure, a process known as epigenetics. Ayurveda addresses factors such as lifestyle, behavior, diet, digestion, stress, and environmental factors, which cause epigenetic changes. These practices can affect both the body Prakriti (psychophysiological constitution) and birth Prakriti (genotype), potentially leading to optimal health. Further research on Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression is expected to enhance the understanding and integration of Ayurveda with the current medical system.","According to 'Epigenetics: An Important Mechanism of Ayurveda for Healthcare', your lifestyle, diet, stress levels, and environment can actually change how your genes work, without altering the DNA structure itself. This is called 'epigenetics' and these changes can even be passed down to future generations. Ayurveda, an ancient Indian health system, focuses on these factors to help improve your health. So, by following Ayurvedic practices, you might not only feel better but also potentially influence your gene expression for the better. This could be a cool way to merge traditional Ayurveda and modern medicine for optimal health. More research is needed though, to fully understand how Ayurvedic methods can affect our genes.","According to 'Ayurveda and epigenetics', Ayurveda, which is a natural health care system from India, can help improve your health by influencing your genes. This doesn't mean changing your genes, but rather, it can turn certain genes on or off through things like changing your diet, managing stress, and other lifestyle changes. So, practices from Ayurveda could potentially help your overall health by affecting how your genes work."
1,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with  complex multi-organ-multi-target crosstalk in the body. Currently, the  theoretical assumptions framing the diabetes management strategies are  reductionist and largely focus on reducing hyperglycemia through targeted  molecular drugs. While they effectively reduce hyperglycemia, they are  inadequate to address the multifactorial etiopathology, chronicity and systemic  complications of diabetes. Therefore, a holistic and systemic approach is  essential for its successful management. We hypothesize an integrative diabetes  management strategy, combining holistic principles of diabetes management with  its molecular understandings, would be more appropriate to fill this gap. The  holistic disease management principles of Ayurveda, the Indian system of  medicine, can play a pivotal role in this context. This narrative review  discusses the scope of a trans-disciplinary ' Ayurveda-Biology ' approach for  deepening the holistic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes as well  as designing novel integrative strategies for managing diabetes and restoring  whole body glucose homeostasis. METHODOLOGY: The article analyses the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management and  correlates it with the molecular understanding of its pathophysiology and  management. The sources of information used in this article include classical  texts of Ayurveda , medical books, published research articles and scientific  databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science-Direct, etc. RESULTS: While  Ayurveda and modern biomedicine uses different epistemology and ontology for  describing diabetes, both the systems recognize the central role of gut and gut  derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose  homeostasis. Essentially, the principles of both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine  overlap at a gut centred view of diabetes management; and Gastro-intestinal  mediated glucose disposal , a holistic concept of glucose metabolism, is  emerging as a converging node for designing innovative integrative diabetes  management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: An integrative disease management strategy, combining holistic and  reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively,  would be the prerogative for successful management of diabetes. Creating an '  Ayurveda-Biology' knowledge framework integrating the patient centred holistic  management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology  can give better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and  offer novel strategies for cost effective, holistic and multi-targeted  management of diabetes.",How can integrating Ayurveda principles with modern biology help in managing diabetes?,"I've heard that diabetes is more than just having high blood sugar levels. Can something like Ayurveda, or holistic approaches in general, help manage it better?",I've been struggling with my diabetes management. Is there a more holistic approach I could try that might help?,"According to ""Gastro-intestinal mediated glucose disposal: a holistic concept of glucose metabolism emerging as a converging node for innovative integrative diabetes management strategies"", combining the holistic principles of Ayurveda with molecular understandings from modern biology can enhance diabetes management. Both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine highlight the importance of the gut and gut-derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose homeostasis. This integrative approach can provide better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and offer novel strategies for cost-effective, holistic, and multi-targeted management of diabetes.","According to 'Gastro-intestinal mediated glucose disposal: An integrative target for holistic and reductionist management of diabetes', managing diabetes isn't just about lowering your blood sugar levels. It's a complex condition that affects different parts of your body. Modern medicine often focuses on specific treatments for this, but there's also a whole-body approach that can be really beneficial. The study suggests that traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, can play a big role in this. Both Ayurveda and modern medicine recognize the importance of your gut in managing blood sugar levels. By combining the targeted treatments of modern medicine with the holistic approach of Ayurveda, we might be able to come up with better and cheaper ways to manage diabetes.","According to 'Exploring a trans-disciplinary 'Ayurveda-Biology' approach for integrative management of diabetes', a more holistic approach to managing diabetes could be beneficial. This means looking at the whole picture of your health, not just focusing on blood sugar levels. The study suggests that combining traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, with modern medical knowledge could provide new strategies for managing diabetes. This could involve understanding the role of your gut in controlling blood sugar and using Ayurveda principles to help balance your overall health. This approach might be more cost-effective and address multiple aspects of managing diabetes."
2,"Epilepsy, a chronic non-communicable disease of the brain, is one of the most  common neurological diseases globally that affects people of all ages. The  existence of medical, neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive comorbidities has  always undermined the available advanced treatment strategies for epilepsy.  New-generation antiepileptic drugs being less successful in completely  controlling the seizures and observance of complex diseases, including  drug-resistant cases, have provided scope for integrating and incorporating the  therapeutic modalities of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian art of holistic medicine,  in the effective management of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara,  described in the classics of Ayurveda as the transient appearance of  unconsciousness with loathsome expression due to derangement of memory,  intelligence, and mind. The multifaceted therapeutic approach of Ayurveda, which  involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying  procedures, herbal and herbo-mineral formulations, disease, and host-specific  approaches, have enhanced the potential of not only relieving symptoms but also  modifying the pathophysiology of the disease. Newer paradigms of research in  Ayurveda, along with holistic and integrative approaches with contemporary  medicine, can not only benefit the existing healthcare system but also impact  future healthcare management in epileptology research.

Ayurveda also employs disease-specific and host-specific approaches, which can enhance the potential not only for symptom relief but also for modifying the pathophysiology of the disease. The research advocates for a holistic and integrative approach that combines Ayurvedic methods with contemporary medicine, which could benefit the existing healthcare system and influence future healthcare","According to 'Integrating therapeutic modalities of Ayurveda in the effective management of epilepsy: a literature review', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, might actually help in managing epilepsy. This is because epilepsy isn't just a simple condition - it can come with other medical and mental health issues that make it harder to treat. Modern antiepileptic drugs don't always work for everyone, which is where Ayurveda comes in. It uses a mix of herbal treatments, lifestyle changes, and even cleansing procedures to not just ease symptoms but potentially change the course of the disease. Combining Ayurveda with modern medicine could be a game-changer, not just for current healthcare but also for future research on epilepsy.","According to 'Ayurvedic perspectives on epilepsy: a literature review', your epilepsy, which is sometimes causing you to lose consciousness and affecting your memory and mind, could potentially be helped by Ayurveda. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian method of treatment that uses a mix of natural remedies, lifestyle changes, and other holistic practices. The paper suggests that these kinds of treatments might not just help with your symptoms, but could also change the way your condition behaves. This means it could potentially help you feel better overall, not just stop the seizures. It's worth discussing with your doctor about integrating some Ayurvedic treatments into your current plan."

7,"Ayurveda is a traditional system of healthcare that is native to India and has a  rich documented literature of its own. Most of the historians agree that the  documentation of core Ayurveda literature took place approximately in between  400 BCE and 200 CE, while acknowledging that the roots of its theoretical  framework can be traced back to a much earlier period. For multiple reasons many  significant contributions of Ayurveda literature to various streams of  biological and medical sciences have remained under-recognized while recounting  the historical milestones of development. This is true in the context of the  physiology of digestion and metabolism too. In this communication we try to  reconstruct a picture of the processes of digestion and metabolism as had been  understood by ancient Ayurveda scholars. Though this understanding was primitive  and insufficient in many ways, we argue that this deserves to be documented and  acknowledged. To help with grasping the importance of these contributions, we  juxtapose them with the corresponding insights pertaining to this subject  reported by prominent western scientists. The major contributions of Ayurveda  that have been recounted in this paper are those related to the description of  three distinct phases of digestion (Avasthapaka), multiple sets of  transformative entities acting at different levels of metabolism (Agni), and the  roles ascribed to various internal and external factors in executing these  physiological functions.",What are the key contributions of Ayurveda to our understanding of digestion and metabolism?,I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately.

Even though this knowledge is from a long time ago and may not be complete, it is still valuable and worth recognizing."
8,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, included geriatrics as 1 of 8  medical divisions. Well-documented evidence exists for treating aging and  age-related disorders including dementia. Geriatrics was termed Rasayanatantra.  Cognitive function was well recognized and Sanskrit terms existed such as Buddhi  for intelligence and Cittanasa (Citta means mind, nasa means loss of) for  dementia. A normal human life span was considered to be 100 years. It could be  prolonged to 116-120 years through the use of preventive treatments, if they  were started during late youth or middle age. Treatments included herbal  preparations, diet, exercise, and attention to general mode of life and social  behavior.

9,"BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva. Although data  on clinical efficacy and safety of various ayurvedic treatments in  conjunctivitis is published, systematic review is not done. This systematic  review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ayurvedic  treatments in conjunctivitis. METHODS: A literature search of the Cochrane Library (Cochrane central register  of controlled trials: issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Pub Med, AYUSH research portal  (Govt. of India), DHARA portal, Google scholar and online clinical trials  registers was done. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized  controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and multiple arms  clinical trials were identified in which Ayurveda treatments with any dose,  type, schedule, drug, dosage form, and advised Pathayapathya (lifestyle changes)  were selected. RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, five CCTs and two multiple arms  clinical trials which includes a total of 816 participants. Meta analysis of  data from five trials showed that ayurvedic treatments benefitted more compared  with non-ayurveda interventions in symptoms like itching (SMD = -0.98, 95% CI  (-1.30,-0.65) p < 0.00001, I2 = 38%), pain (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI (-0.87, -0.29,  P = 0.0001, I2 = 0%), ropy discharge (SMD = -1.02, 95% CI(-1.45, -0.59),  P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), conjunctival congestion (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-0.91,  -0.43), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), foreign body sensation (SMD = -0.68, 95%  CI(-1.06, -0.29), p = 0.0006, I2 = 46%, Fig. 8) and lid heaviness (SMD = -0.66,  95% CI(- 0.98, -0.33), p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Although some findings confirm the benefit of ayurveda as opposed  to non ayurveda for the treatment of conjunctivitis, since the studies have high  risk of bias and are of lower quality, the findings could not be generalized.  There is a need for high quality studies in ayurveda in this regard.

The tiny organisms living in your gut, often referred to as your gut microbiome, play a huge role in your overall health. It's like having a mini community of helpful bacteria and other microorganisms that aid in digestion, boost your immune system, and even affect your mood.

Now, just like any community, the makeup of these microorganisms can change based on different factors. One of the biggest factors is your diet. If you eat a lot of processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats, you might end up with a not-so-great mix of bacteria in your gut. On the other hand, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fermented foods can promote a healthier, more diverse gut microbiome.

This concept isn't new; traditional health systems like Ayurveda have emphasized the importance of diet and digestion for thousands of years. So, by choosing what you eat wisely, you can actually help cultivate a healthier gut, which in turn can lead to better overall health. It's pretty cool, right?","Yes, according to Ayurveda, the food you eat can influence the health of your gut and your overall well-being."

Although the roots of this knowledge  date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a  dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between  400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these  early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among  the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda  have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine.

Methods We did a  cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics  at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using  a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed  using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed  to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among  them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that  Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations  (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%).  Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and  newspaper advertisements (13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined  that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of  participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be  beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had  Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to  participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine.  Conclusion Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail  in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed. We found imprecise  knowledge of Ayurvedic therapies and its low usage among patients attending  specialized OPDs in a tertiary care hospital. The major source of information  reported was promotional advertisements in the print and electronic media. Our  survey shows a need for awareness programmes for general public at various  levels.",What are some ways to increase public awareness about the benefits of Ayurveda?,I've heard a lot about Ayurveda on TV and in newspapers. Is it actually effective for long-term health issues?,I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda lately. Do you think it could be beneficial for someone my age with chronic health issues?,"According to ""Knowledge, attitude and practice regarding Ayurveda among patients attending cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care institute"", the primary source of information about Ayurveda for the surveyed patients was through promotional advertisements in print and electronic media. However, the study also highlighted the need for increased awareness programs about Ayurveda for the general public at various levels, due to the imprecise knowledge and low practice of Ayurvedic remedies among the surveyed patients.","According to a study done in India, a lot of people have heard about Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, mostly from TV and newspaper ads. Most people think Ayurveda includes herbal drugs and some other therapies. Even though not many people are using it right now, a lot of them think it could be beneficial if a major medical institute in India started offering Ayurveda services. They also showed interest in participating in research that combines Ayurveda with modern medicine. However, the study found that people's knowledge about Ayurveda was a bit unclear, so they suggest more awareness programs are needed.","According to 'Knowledge, attitude and practice regarding Ayurveda among patients attending cardiology and neurology clinics in a tertiary care hospital in India', many people believe that Ayurveda, which includes herbal remedies and other natural treatments, can be helpful for long-term health problems. However, the study also found that most people have a limited understanding of what Ayurveda involves and how it works. The main sources of information for these people are TV shows and newspaper ads. Despite this lack of knowledge, many people expressed interest in using Ayurveda treatments and participating in studies that combine Ayurveda with modern medicine. The researchers suggest that more educational programs are needed to help people understand Ayurveda better."
35,"Under the aegis of the World Health Organization, the Movement for Global Mental  Health and an Indian Supreme Court ruling, biomedical psychiatric interventions  have expanded in India augmenting biomedical hegemony in a place that is known  for its variety of healing modalities. This occurs despite the fact that studies  by the WHO show better outcomes in India for people suffering from schizophrenia  and related diagnoses when compared to people in developed countries with  greater access to biomedical psychiatry. Practitioners of ayurvedic medicine in  Kerala have been mounting a claim for a significant role in public mental health  in the face of this growing hegemony.This study examines efforts by ayurvedic  practitioners to expand access to ayurvedic mental health services in Kerala,  and profiles a rehabilitation center which combines biomedical and ayurvedic  therapies and has been a key player in efforts to expand the use of Ayurveda for  mental health. The paper argues for maintaining a pluralistic healing  environment for treating mental illness rather than displacing other healing  modalities in favor of a biomedical psychiatric approach.",Can Ayurvedic therapies be effective in treating mental health issues?,"I've been hearing a lot about Ayurveda recently. How can it help with my mental health struggles, especially when compared to traditional therapy or medication?",I've been feeling quite down lately. Are there any natural or traditional treatments in India that could help improve my mental health?,"According to ""Biomedical hegemony and pluralism in mental health in India: the role of Ayurveda"", Ayurvedic practitioners in Kerala are advocating for greater access to Ayurvedic mental health services. The paper highlights a rehabilitation center in Kerala that successfully integrates both biomedical and Ayurvedic therapies for mental health treatment. The authors argue for the importance of a pluralistic healing environment, suggesting that Ayurvedic therapies could be a valuable part of mental health treatment.","According to 'Ayurveda for Mental Health: Biomedical-Alternative Medicine Interface in a Mental Health Rehabilitation Center in Kerala, India', Ayurveda, an ancient Indian healing practice, could be a beneficial approach for mental health issues. The study suggests that relying solely on modern psychiatric methods might not always be the best solution, as incorporating Ayurveda could offer a more balanced and holistic treatment. This is similar to how some people find yoga and meditation helpful alongside traditional therapy and medication. The researchers encourage keeping a mix of different healing methods for the best results.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine and the treatment of mental illness in India: the case for a pluralistic approach', traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatments may be beneficial for mental health. The research suggests that using a combination of different healing methods, including Ayurveda, could be more effective for treating mental illness than just relying on modern biomedical approaches. This is particularly true in India, where studies have shown better outcomes for people with mental health conditions like schizophrenia when using Ayurvedic treatments."
36,"Within the disciplines of modern medicine, P4 medicine is emerging as a new  field which focuses on the whole patient. The development of Ayurgenomics could  greatly enrich P4 medicine by providing a clear theoretical understanding of the  whole patient and a practical application of ancient and modern preventative and  therapeutic practices to improve mental and physical health. One of the most  difficult challenges today is understanding the ancient concepts of Ayurveda in  terms of modern science. To date, a number of researchers have attempted this  task, of which one of the most successful outcomes is the creation of the new  field of Ayurgenomics. Ayurgenomics integrates concepts in Ayurveda, such as  Prakriti, with modern genetics research. It correlates the combination of three  doshas, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, with the expression of specific genes and  physiological characteristics. It also helps to interpret Ayurveda as an ancient  science of epigenetics which assesses the current state of the doshas, and uses  specific personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations to improve a patient's  health. This review provides a current update of this emerging field.",How can Ayurgenomics help improve my mental and physical health through personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations?,I've heard about Ayurveda and personalized diets. Can they actually help me to feel healthier and more balanced?,Can this Ayurgenomics approach suggest any specific diet or lifestyle changes that could help improve my overall health?,"According to ""Ayurgenomics and modern medicine: the example of rheumatoid arthritis"", Ayurgenomics, an emerging field that integrates Ayurvedic concepts with modern genetics research, can provide personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations to improve health. It correlates the combination of three doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) with the expression of specific genes and physiological characteristics. By assessing the current state of these doshas, Ayurgenomics can offer specific recommendations aimed at improving a patient's health. This approach interprets Ayurveda as an ancient science of epigenetics, which further enriches P4 medicine, a discipline focused on the whole patient.","According to 'Ayurgenomics: a new field correlating Ayurveda and genomics', Ayurveda, an ancient medical practice, is being combined with modern genetics research to create personalized health recommendations. This new field, called Ayurgenomics, basically looks at your unique genetic makeup and suggests specific diets and lifestyle changes to improve your health. So, it's like having a tailored fitness and diet plan based on not just what works for most people, but what works best for you specifically. This could potentially help you feel healthier and more balanced.","According to 'Ayurgenomics: personalized medicine integrating genomics, Ayurveda and yoga', the field of Ayurgenomics combines ancient wisdom from Ayurveda with modern genetics to better understand a person's overall health. It looks at the balance of three elements in your body, called Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, and how they relate to your genes and health. Based on this, it can give personalized advice on diet and lifestyle to help improve your health."
37,"In the past two decades, health care has become a global market and  transnational practice. An emerging body of literature examines the astounding  variety of drivers, conditions, and experiences. However, the question of how  traveling abroad for treatment emerges as an option and takes shape in people's  illness trajectories has gained little attention thus far. This article attends  to this gap by following the stories of people with chronic conditions who  travel to India for Ayurveda treatment out of dissatisfaction with local  biomedical health care. This study expands the focus of current research on  transnational therapeutic mobilities in three ways: (1) by shifting the  attention from being a foreign patient or medical traveler to becoming one, (2)  by integrating quests for other-than-biomedical therapies, and (3) by applying a  narrative approach to the field. Results show that apart from social, human, and  financial resources, it takes certain patient-subjectivities to mobilize  patients across borders and healing systems.",What factors might lead someone to seek Ayurveda treatment in India for chronic conditions?,"I'm not really happy with the healthcare I'm getting here. Have you ever heard of people going to other countries for different treatments, like Ayurveda in India?",I'm not happy with my current health care. Would it be a good idea to consider going to India for Ayurveda treatment?,"According to ""Dissatisfaction, desire, and daring: narrative insights into transnational therapeutic mobilities"", individuals with chronic conditions may seek Ayurveda treatment in India due to dissatisfaction with local biomedical health care. However, the study also indicates that in addition to social, human, and financial resources, it requires certain patient-subjectivities to engage in such transnational therapeutic mobilities.","Yeah, I've heard about that. There's actually a study that looks into why some people travel to India for Ayurveda treatment when they're not satisfied with the healthcare they're getting locally. It's not just about being a medical tourist, but about the journey and the personal reasons behind it. It takes more than just money and time - you also need the right mindset and support to make such a big move for your health.","According to the research, some people with ongoing health issues choose to travel to India for Ayurveda treatment because they are not satisfied with the local medical care. This study suggests that it's not just about having the money or the social connections to do so, but also about being the kind of person who is willing to seek out different ways to heal."

42,"Ayurveda, the science of life, is a comprehensive medical system that has been  the traditional system of healthcare in India for more than 5000 years. This  medical system was well established around 2500 to 600 BC, when it evolved into  2 schools: the School of Physicians and the School of Surgeons, similar to  allopathy. Charak Samhita, Susrut Samhita, and Ashtang Hridaya Samhita are the  Senior Triad texts, and Madhav Nidan Samhita, Sarangdhar Samhita, and  Bhavprakash Samhita are the Junior Triad texts. Around 600 BC. Ayurveda was  branched into internal medicine; pediatrics; psychiatry; surgery; eye, ear,  nose, and throat; toxicology; geriatrics; and eugenics/aphrodisiacs. The body is  composed of 3 body doshas, 3 mental doshas, 7 dhatus, and malas. The harmony  among the body doshas of vata (nervous system), pitta (enzymes), and kapha  (mucus) and the gunas, or mental doshas (which are human attributes: satogun  [godly], rajas [kingly], and tamas [evil]), constitutes health, and their  disharmony constitutes disease.

43,"Modern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is  likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it  is practised. The mechanistic model which served biomedicine well for many years  is gradually collapsing, thanks to the efforts of dedicated researchers who have  looked beyond that model's flaws. Thus we now know that networks of chemical  communication exist between the nervous and immune systems, and that prayer at a  distance can positively affect the conditions of those who are seriously ill,  even when the prayer and the patient are not known to one another. Another  participant in this exciting climate of change and ferment is Ayurveda, India's  ancient medical system. While Ayurveda has already contributed much to modern  medicine (reserpine, gugulipid, plastic surgery), its real contributions are yet  to be made.

46,"OBJECTIVE: To collect contemporary accounts of celebrity use of complementary  and alternative medicine (CAM), to aid clinicians in determining which CAM  treatments patients are likely to use. DESIGN: Articles published during 2005 and 2006 reporting celebrity use of CAM. RESULTS: 38 celebrities were found to use a wide range of CAM interventions.  Homeopathy, acupuncture and Ayurveda were the most popular modalities. CONCLUSIONS: There may be many reasons why consumers use CAM, and wanting to  imitate their idols is one of them.",What types of alternative medicine are most popular among celebrities?,"So, I heard some celebs are into this thing called CAM? What's it all about and what kind of treatments are they using?",I've heard that some celebrities use natural treatments for their health. What are some of the most common ones they use?,"According to ""Celebrity medicine: a source of information on celebrity use of complementary and alternative medicine"", homeopathy, acupuncture, and Ayurveda are the most popular complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities used by celebrities.","Yeah, so CAM stands for complementary and alternative medicine. According to a study, a bunch of celebrities were using all sorts of these treatments. The most popular ones were homeopathy (which is like super diluted medicines), acupuncture (those tiny needles they stick in your body), and Ayurveda (an ancient Indian wellness system). The study also suggests that one reason people might try out these treatments is because they see their favorite celebs doing it.","According to 'Celebrity medicine: a media analysis', many celebrities use different types of natural treatments. The most common ones are homeopathy, acupuncture, and Ayurveda."
47,"Ayurveda is a traditional medicine native to India but is used in many parts of  the world as an alternative or adjunct to standard medicine. Preparation can  involve incorporation of heavy metals, including lead. We report the case of a  64-year-old man presenting with malaise, abdominal pain, anaemia and very high  lead levels. He was found to be taking ayurvedic medicines to help his diabetic  control. Analysis of the ayurvedic medications showed several with very high  lead content. Following treatment with an oral chelating agent, the patient's  symptoms and blood abnormalities resolved. This case highlights the need to be  aware of potentially toxic alternative medications patients take and the  efficacy of oral treatment choices in lead poisoning.",What should I be aware of when taking Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes management?,"I've been using this Ayurvedic medicine I got online to help with my stress levels, but I've been feeling pretty sick lately. Could it have something to do with that?","I've been considering trying Ayurvedic remedies for my health issues. Are there any risks I should be aware of, such as potentially harmful ingredients?","According to 'Lead poisoning due to ayurvedic medicine', some Ayurvedic medicines, particularly those used for diabetes control, can contain very high levels of lead. Therefore, it's important to be aware of this potential risk when considering Ayurvedic remedies for diabetes management. In the event of lead poisoning, treatment with an oral chelating agent was effective in resolving symptoms and blood abnormalities.","According to a study, a guy who was using Ayurvedic medicine, which is a traditional Indian remedy, to control his diabetes ended up feeling really sick because the medicine had a lot of lead in it. He had symptoms like feeling weak, stomach pain, and anemia. Once he stopped taking the medicine and started treatment for lead poisoning, he got better. So, be careful with alternative medicines you buy online or elsewhere, they might have harmful stuff in them.","According to 'Lead poisoning due to traditional Indian medicine', using certain Ayurvedic medicines, which are traditional remedies from India, could potentially expose you to harmful levels of lead. This happened to a man who was using these medicines for his diabetes. He felt unwell, had stomach pain, and was found to have high levels of lead in his blood. After he stopped taking the medicines and received treatment to remove the lead from his body, he started to feel better. So, it's important to be cautious and know what's in the medicines you're taking."
48,"OBJECTIVE: Ayurveda is commonly used in South Asia to treat knee osteoarthritis  (OA). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment compared to  conventional conservative care in patients with knee OA. METHOD: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria knee OA  patients were included in a multicenter randomized, controlled, open-label trial  and treated in 2 hospital clinics and 2 private outpatient clinics in Germany.  Participants received either a multi-modal Ayurvedic treatment or multi-modal  conventional care with 15 treatments over 12 weeks respectively. Primary outcome  was the change on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis  (WOMAC) Index after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales; the  pain disability index and a pain experience scale, numeric rating scales for  pain and sleep quality, quality-of-life and mood, rescue medication use, and  safety issues. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one participants (Ayurveda n = 77, conventional care  n = 74) were included. Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were  more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95%CI: 52.4;69.6])  than in the conventional group (32.0 [95%CI: 21.4;42.6]) resulting in a  significant between-group difference (p < 0.001) and a clinically relevant  effect size (Cohen's d 0.68 [95% CI:0.35;1.01]). Similar trends were observed  for all secondary outcomes at week 12. Effects were sustained at follow-ups  after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that Ayurvedic treatment is beneficial in reducing  knee OA symptoms. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the magnitude  of the effect and to clarify the role of different treatment components and  non-specific effects. REGISTRATION: at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01225133; initial  release 10/06/2010).",Can Ayurvedic treatments help reduce symptoms of knee osteoarthritis?,I've heard about this Ayurvedic treatment thing for knee pain. Is it any better than the usual treatments?,"I have knee osteoarthritis and the regular treatments aren't helping much. Is there a natural treatment, maybe something like Ayurveda, that could help ease my knee pain?","According to ""Ayurvedic treatment for knee osteoarthritis - results of a randomized controlled trial"", Ayurvedic treatment has been found beneficial in reducing symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. The study showed more pronounced changes on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index in the Ayurveda group compared to the conventional care group, indicating a significant reduction in knee OA symptoms. These effects were sustained at follow-ups after 6 and 12 months. However, further studies are needed to confirm the magnitude of the effect and to understand the role of different treatment components and non-specific effects.","According to a study published in 'Complementary Therapies in Medicine', Ayurvedic treatments might be a better option for knee osteoarthritis (OA) than conventional treatments. The study compared these two methods and found that people who received Ayurvedic treatment reported a bigger improvement in their knee pain and related issues. This wasn't just a short-term thing, as the benefits were still there six to twelve months later. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand how exactly the Ayurvedic treatment works. So, if you're struggling with knee OA, Ayurveda might be worth looking into.","According to 'Effectiveness of Ayurvedic versus conventional conservative treatment in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial', a study was done to compare Ayurvedic treatments, which are natural remedies often used in South Asia, with regular treatments for knee osteoarthritis. The results showed that the Ayurvedic treatments were more effective in reducing symptoms after 12 weeks, and these benefits continued for 6 and 12 months after the treatment. So, it might be worth considering trying some Ayurvedic treatments to help with your knee pain."
49,"Objectives: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a well-known student-centered  instructional approach that is known to enhance problem-solving skills among the  learners. Because teaching/learning methods in most of the Ayurveda colleges in  India are still didactic and teacher centric, the effects of introducing PBL  have not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to develop  PBL modules for Kriya Sharira (Ayurveda Physiology) and their implementation in  a hybrid format. In this method, PBL is used as an add-on component along with  didactic lectures. The secondary objective of the study was to compare the  learning outcomes achieved through hybrid problem-based learning (HPBL) with  those achieved through conventional teaching. Design: This is a prospectively  planned post-test-only, controlled interventional design with nonequivalent  groups. However, the results have been analyzed in a retrospective manner.  Subjects: Students enrolled in the first professional Bachelor of Ayurvedic  Medicine and Surgery program during two consecutive academic sessions 2016-2017  and 2017-2018 at the Banaras Hindu University were included in the study. While  the cohort from 2016 to 2017 session served as the control group, the one from  2017 to 2018 session served as the experimental group. Interventions: The  instructional method commonly known as HPBL was introduced to the experimental  group. Outcome measures: Five test papers containing mostly Multiple Choice  Questions for five different topics were used as the tools for evaluating the  learning outcomes in both the groups. Feedback forms regarding the experiences  of undergoing HPBL were obtained from experimental group. Results: While the  test results for three topics showed that the outcomes of HPBL were comparable  with conventional teaching, the results on other two topics suggested that HPBL  was slightly better. Feedback obtained showed that there is a considerable  acceptance for HPBL over conventional method. Conclusions: The study shows that  it is possible to implement HPBL method in a large classroom in the context of  Ayurveda education. The findings also indicate that students find HPBL as an  acceptable teaching method.",What are the benefits of using a problem-based learning approach in Ayurveda education?,I'm studying Ayurvedic Medicine and we're stuck with really old-school teaching methods. Do you think introducing something like problem-based learning might make classes more engaging and effective?,"Is there a more effective way to learn about Ayurveda, like hands-on learning or problem-solving, instead of just lectures?","According to ""Development and implementation of hybrid problem-based learning modules in Ayurveda physiology - an instructional design study"", the hybrid problem-based learning (HPBL) approach, which combines PBL with traditional didactic lectures, was implemented in Ayurveda education. The study found that the learning outcomes from HPBL were comparable to those achieved through conventional teaching methods, and in two specific topics, HPBL proved to be slightly better. Furthermore, feedback indicated that students found HPBL to be an acceptable teaching method.","According to a study, introducing problem-based learning (PBL) - a more interactive and student-focused teaching method - in Ayurveda colleges in India, showed promising results. They tested this new method on students and compared their learning outcomes to those from the traditional lecture-based approach used in the past. The results were pretty much the same for most topics, but for a couple of topics, the students taught with PBL actually did better. Plus, the students seemed to enjoy this new method more. So, it seems like PBL could be a cool way to make Ayurveda education more engaging and potentially more effective.","Yes, according to the study, using a combination of traditional lectures and problem-based learning (HPBL) can be an effective way to learn about Ayurveda. This method involves solving real-life problems related to what you're studying, and students have found it to be an acceptable and beneficial approach."
