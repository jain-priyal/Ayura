How can Ayurvedic practices influence my gene expression for better health,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive, natural health care system that originated in the ancient Vedic times of India. Epigenetics refers to the external modification of DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors. Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha body Prakriti psychophysiological constitution, which corresponds to the phenotype, and indirectly the Janma birth Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus, it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of both sciences in the management of optimal health. In addition, research on Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will further increase correlation and understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda.","According to Ayurveda and Epigenetics, Ayurveda, a natural health care system, can indirectly affect our genes, or genotype, by addressing lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors. These practices influence the body and psychophysiological constitution, which corresponds to the phenotype. Research suggests that this is a key mechanism of Ayurveda and can lead to better integration with the current medical system for optimal health management. Further research on Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression is also recommended for improved understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda."
How can the principles of Ayurveda be integrated with modern biology for a more holistic management of diabetes,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with complex multi-organ-multi-target crosstalk in the body. Currently, the theoretical assumptions framing the diabetes management strategies are reductionist and largely focus on reducing hyperglycemia through targeted molecular drugs. While they effectively reduce hyperglycemia, they are inadequate to address the multifactorial etiopathology, chronicity and systemic complications of diabetes. Therefore, a holistic and systemic approach is essential for its successful management. We hypothesize an integrative diabetes management strategy, combining holistic principles of diabetes management with its molecular understandings, would be more appropriate to fill this gap. The holistic disease management principles of Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine, can play a pivotal role in this context. This narrative review discusses the scope of a trans-disciplinary Ayurveda-Biology approach for deepening the holistic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes as well as designing novel integrative strategies for managing diabetes and restoring whole body glucose homeostasis. METHODOLOGY The article analyses the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management and correlates it with the molecular understanding of its pathophysiology and management. The sources of information used in this article include classical texts of Ayurveda , medical books, published research articles and scientific databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science-Direct, etc. RESULTS While Ayurveda and modern biomedicine uses different epistemology and ontology for describing diabetes, both the systems recognize the central role of gut and gut derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose homeostasis. Essentially, the principles of both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine overlap at a gut centred view of diabetes management and Gastro-intestinal mediated glucose disposal , a holistic concept of glucose metabolism, is emerging as a converging node for designing innovative integrative diabetes management strategies. CONCLUSIONS An integrative disease management strategy, combining holistic and reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively, would be the prerogative for successful management of diabetes. Creating an Ayurveda-Biology knowledge framework integrating the patient centred holistic management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology can give better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and offer novel strategies for cost effective, holistic and multi-targeted management of diabetes.","According to An Ayurveda-Biology platform for integrative diabetes management, a holistic and systemic approach to diabetes management is suggested, combining the principles of Ayurveda with a molecular understanding of the disease. This strategy incorporates gut-centered views of diabetes management, recognising the central role of gut and gut derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose homeostasis. The study suggests that an integrative disease management strategy, which combines holistic and reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively, could lead to more successful management of diabetes."
How can Ayurveda contribute to the management and treatment of epilepsy,"Epilepsy, a chronic non-communicable disease of the brain, is one of the most common neurological diseases globally that affects people of all ages. The existence of medical, neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive comorbidities has always undermined the available advanced treatment strategies for epilepsy. New-generation antiepileptic drugs being less successful in completely controlling the seizures and observance of complex diseases, including drug-resistant cases, have provided scope for integrating and incorporating the therapeutic modalities of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian art of holistic medicine, in the effective management of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara, described in the classics of Ayurveda as the transient appearance of unconsciousness with loathsome expression due to derangement of memory, intelligence, and mind. The multifaceted therapeutic approach of Ayurveda, which involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying procedures, herbal and herbo-mineral formulations, disease, and host-specific approaches, have enhanced the potential of not only relieving symptoms but also modifying the pathophysiology of the disease. Newer paradigms of research in Ayurveda, along with holistic and integrative approaches with contemporary medicine, can not only benefit the existing healthcare system but also impact future healthcare management in epileptology research. This cursory literature review is an earnest attempt to identify, evaluate, and summarize various studies and provide a comprehensive insight into the potential of Ayurveda in understanding and treating epilepsy.","According to Ayurveda therapy in the management of epilepsy, epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara in Ayurveda. The Ayurvedic approach to managing epilepsy includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying procedures, and herbal and herbo-mineral formulations.

What are the three distinct phases of digestion according to Ayurveda,"Ayurveda is a traditional system of healthcare that is native to India and has a rich documented literature of its own. Most of the historians agree that the documentation of core Ayurveda literature took place approximately in between 400 BCE and 200 CE, while acknowledging that the roots of its theoretical framework can be traced back to a much earlier period. For multiple reasons many significant contributions of Ayurveda literature to various streams of biological and medical sciences have remained under-recognized while recounting the historical milestones of development. This is true in the context of the physiology of digestion and metabolism too. In this communication we try to reconstruct a picture of the processes of digestion and metabolism as had been understood by ancient Ayurveda scholars. Though this understanding was primitive and insufficient in many ways, we argue that this deserves to be documented and acknowledged. To help with grasping the importance of these contributions, we juxtapose them with the corresponding insights pertaining to this subject reported by prominent western scientists. The major contributions of Ayurveda that have been recounted in this paper are those related to the description of three distinct phases of digestion Avasthapaka, multiple sets of transformative entities acting at different levels of metabolism Agni, and the roles ascribed to various internal and external factors in executing these physiological functions.","According to Overlooked contributions of Ayurveda literature to the history of physiology of digestion and metabolism, Ayurvedas significant contributions to the understanding of digestion and metabolism include the description of three distinct phases of digestion Avasthapaka, the identification of multiple transformative entities that act at different levels of metabolism Agni, and the recognition of the roles of various internal and external factors in executing these physiological functions."
What are some Ayurvedic practices or treatments that could potentially extend my lifespan or improve my cognitive function as I age,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, included geriatrics as 1 of 8 medical divisions. Well-documented evidence exists for treating aging and age-related disorders including dementia. Geriatrics was termed Rasayanatantra. Cognitive function was well recognized and Sanskrit terms existed such as Buddhi for intelligence and Cittanasa Citta means mind, nasa means loss of for dementia. A normal human life span was considered to be 100 years. It could be prolonged to 116-120 years through the use of preventive treatments, if they were started during late youth or middle age. Treatments included herbal preparations, diet, exercise, and attention to general mode of life and social behavior. Several herbal formulations are described, including details of their composition and preparation. The mode of action of antiaging drugs was believed to occur at 3 levels.

How does Ayurveda contribute to overall health and well-being in everyday life in Sri Lanka,"Ayurveda, in practice, comprises far more than a medical tradition in Sri Lanka. It provides, in addition to a manuscript for health care, a popular knowledge paradigm by which the population addresses social, epistemological and ontological issues in their lives. The concept of health expands to include the many existential levels that are basic to a definition of the self and the many arenas of life in which it is made evident. The concept of multilectic process is introduced in this paper to explain this dynamic that characterizes popular Ayurveda, a dynamic that Sri Lankans specify as consisting of a fundamental complex interplay of mutually interrelated factors that are capable of referencing multiple meanings and life contingencies neither contradictory, dichotomous, nor unidirectional in nature. Because of the extent to which Ayurveda is embedded in the everyday lives and fundamental conceptual frameworks of the Sri Lankans, it is likely to remain an integrating knowledge system and a powerful explanatory paradigm in their general lives as well as for their health care dilemmas.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedies. However, it discusses the significant role of Ayurveda in the everyday lives and fundamental conceptual frameworks of Sri Lankans. According to Ayurveda a multilectic interpretation, Ayurveda is not only a health care system but also a popular knowledge paradigm addressing various aspects of life. It is characterized by a dynamic multilectic process, reflecting a complex interplay of mutually interrelated factors, capable of referencing multiple meanings and life contingencies."

What types of therapies does Ayurveda offer for mental health issues,"The ancient medicine of India ayurveda is a broadly conceptualized anthropology embracing the whole human being without the Western bodysoul dualism. A symptomatology based on careful observation leads, in conjunction with etiology, pathogenesis and pathology, with constitutional and personality features, to a differentiated nosology. This broad concept is matched by multidimensional therapy embracing pharmacologic, surgical, psychotherapeutic and paramedical measures. Ayurveda life knowledge is a combination of religious, philosophical, anthropological, medical and psychological concepts. It is impressive how accurate the knowledge and description of psychiatric diseases already was 2,500 years ago, and how little these phenomena have changed with time.

Can Ayurveda provide any effective treatments for Covid-19,"As the search for effective treatment for Covid-19 intensifies, traditional medicine systems are receiving increasing attention from researchers as well as the public. While scientific rigour is non-negotiable, there remain fundamental issues to be addressed when bringing evidence from traditional systems. Here we examine some of these issues pertaining to Ayurveda and the underlying philosophical underpinnings, and suggest potential ways to move forward. We find an ability to emerge from the cage of biomedicalism and its foundational reductionism essential for appropriate research in Ayurveda. We caution against pursuing research in Ayurveda by just mimicking modern medicine and highlight the need for appropriate use of modern science tools and methods to understand Ayurveda and explore its potential for healthcare. We emphasise the need and potential for transdisciplinary research in Ayurveda. A balance between evidence-based medicine and evidence-informed healthcare is required.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific Ayurvedic remedies.

How can Ayurveda help in the management of food allergies and intolerances,"Food allergy being a common health problem needs attention. The experience of Ayurveda can be utilized to accelerate our understanding and management of food allergies and related phenomenon like allergic tension fatigue syndrome, intolerance and indigestion associated with certain foods. Prevention of food allergies by carefully selecting the foods in accordance with the individuals body constitution and seasonal alterations, is considered as the best strategy in Ayurveda. If possible, the concept of prakriti and properties of food as described in Ayurveda, should be interpreted in modern terminology. Moreover, to scientifically validate them, an appropriate correlation with modern concepts is required along with scientific studies on modern parameters. Rasayanas may also prove helpful in the management of food allergies. It is obvious that there, is an urgent need for multidimensional and planned investigations of these Ayurvedic rasayanas in management of food allergies. The clinical acceptability of rasayanas for the treatment of food allergies entirely rests on such studies. Food intolerance and allergies are common health problems which are difficult to diagnose and still more difficult to treat. This problem is well addressed in Ayurveda and guidelines are available for their management. This paper aims to present the Ayurvedic concepts in the management of food intolerance allergies and its correlation with the evidences available from modem scientific laboratories. The understanding of this ancient wisdom may prove to be of immense importance in patient care.","According to Food allergies--leads from Ayurveda, the Ayurvedic approach to managing food allergies involves selecting foods in accordance with an individuals body constitution and seasonal changes, a concept known as prakriti. Additionally, Ayurvedic properties of food should, if possible, be interpreted in modern terminology to better understand and validate them scientifically. Ayurvedic rasayanas may also be beneficial in the management of food allergies, though more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and ensure their clinical acceptability."
Can Ayurveda provide any insights into understanding the cardiovascular system,"Ayurveda, the native healthcare system of India, is a rich resource of well-documented ancient medical knowledge. Although the roots of this knowledge date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between 400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine. In this communication, the discovery of blood circulation has been taken up as a case, and a few important references from the representative Ayurveda compendia that hint at a preliminary understanding of the cardiovascular system as a closed circuit and the heart acting as a pump have been reviewed. The central argument of this review is that these contributions from Ayurveda too must be recorded and credited when reviewing the milestones in the history of medicine, as Ayurveda can still possibly guide various streams of the current sciences, if revisited with this spirit.","According to The history of the discovery of blood circulation unrecognized contributions of Ayurveda masters, Ayurveda, an ancient Indian healthcare system, contains references hinting at the understanding of the cardiovascular system as a closed circuit and the heart as a pump. This suggests that Ayurveda may have contributed significantly to the discovery of blood circulation, a fact that has remained unrecognized due to the original texts being written in Sanskrit. The paper suggests that revisiting this knowledge could potentially guide current scientific research."
What are some plant species mentioned in Ayurveda that can be used for health care,"Biodiversity of natural resources has served not only for the primary human needs but also for health care, since time immemorial. The Indian subcontinent, with the history of one of the oldest civilization, harbors many traditional health care systems. Their development was supported by the diverse biodiversity in flora and fauna due to variations in geographical landscaping. Ayurveda, whose history goes back to 5000 b.c., is one of the ancient health care systems. The Ayurveda was developed through daily life experiences with the mutual relationship between mankind and nature. The ancient text of Ayurveda reports more than 2000 plant species for their therapeutic potentials. Besides Ayurveda, other traditional and folklore systems of health care were developed in the different time periods in Indian subcontinent, where more than 7500 plant species were used. According to a WHO estimate, about 80 of the world population relies on traditional systems of medicines for primary health care, where plants form the dominant component over other natural resources. Renewed interest of developing as well as developed countries in the natural resources has opened new horizons for the exploration of natural sources with the perspectives of safety and efficacy. The development of these traditional systems of medicines with the perspectives of safety, efficacy and quality will help not only to preserve this traditional heritage but also to rationalize the use of natural products in the health care. Until recent past, the nature was considered as a compendium for templates of new chemical entities NCEs. The plant species mentioned in the ancient texts of these Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicines may be explored with the modern scientific approaches for better leads in the health care.","According to Integrated approaches towards drug development from Ayurveda and other Indian system of medicines, the Ayurvedic health care system, which dates back to 5000 b.c., has reported therapeutic potentials in more than 2000 plant species.

What is the importance of Ayurveda in the Indian System of Medicine,"This is my response to several recent criticisms that have challenged my views expressed in the article Confessions of an Ayurveda Professor in this journal 1. Some of these criticisms, such as the one by Karthik and Shajin, are directly expressed 2, while others, such as the one by Tubaki and Prasad, are indirect 3. The criticism by Tubaki and Prasad is particularly significant because it is the only feedback I have received from the Ayush establishment thus far and lists the President of the Board of Ayurveda, National Commission for Indian System of Medicine NCISM, as an author. Additionally, there have been many reactions published on IJMEs website. I also address them in this response since many of them share a similar line of thinking.","According to research, The abstract does not provide any specific Ayurvedic remedy information."

How can Ayurvedic practices be incorporated into mental health treatment,"Under the aegis of the World Health Organization, the Movement for Global Mental Health and an Indian Supreme Court ruling, biomedical psychiatric interventions have expanded in India augmenting biomedical hegemony in a place that is known for its variety of healing modalities. This occurs despite the fact that studies by the WHO show better outcomes in India for people suffering from schizophrenia and related diagnoses when compared to people in developed countries with greater access to biomedical psychiatry. Practitioners of ayurvedic medicine in Kerala have been mounting a claim for a significant role in public mental health in the face of this growing hegemony.This study examines efforts by ayurvedic practitioners to expand access to ayurvedic mental health services in Kerala, and profiles a rehabilitation center which combines biomedical and ayurvedic therapies and has been a key player in efforts to expand the use of Ayurveda for mental health. The paper argues for maintaining a pluralistic healing environment for treating mental illness rather than displacing other healing modalities in favor of a biomedical psychiatric approach.","According to Hegemony versus pluralism Ayurveda and the Movement for Global Mental Health, practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine in Kerala, India are working to increase access to Ayurvedic mental health services. The paper highlights a rehabilitation center in Kerala that integrates biomedical and Ayurvedic therapies for mental health treatment. Despite the growing dominance of biomedical psychiatry, the paper advocates for a pluralistic healing environment that includes a variety of treatment modalities like Ayurveda, especially considering that studies have shown better outcomes for mental health patients in India compared to developed countries with more access to biomedical psychiatry."
How can Ayurgenomics help improve my mental and physical health with personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations,"Within the disciplines of modern medicine, P4 medicine is emerging as a new field which focuses on the whole patient. The development of Ayurgenomics could greatly enrich P4 medicine by providing a clear theoretical understanding of the whole patient and a practical application of ancient and modern preventative and therapeutic practices to improve mental and physical health. One of the most difficult challenges today is understanding the ancient concepts of Ayurveda in terms of modern science. To date, a number of researchers have attempted this task, of which one of the most successful outcomes is the creation of the new field of Ayurgenomics. Ayurgenomics integrates concepts in Ayurveda, such as Prakriti, with modern genetics research. It correlates the combination of three doshas, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, with the expression of specific genes and physiological characteristics. It also helps to interpret Ayurveda as an ancient science of epigenetics which assesses the current state of the doshas, and uses specific personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations to improve a patients health. This review provides a current update of this emerging field.","According to Ayurgenomics and Modern Medicine, Ayurgenomics is a new field that combines Ayurvedic concepts like Prakriti with modern genetics research.

What factors might lead someone to seek Ayurveda treatment in India for their chronic condition,"In the past two decades, health care has become a global market and transnational practice. An emerging body of literature examines the astounding variety of drivers, conditions, and experiences. However, the question of how traveling abroad for treatment emerges as an option and takes shape in peoples illness trajectories has gained little attention thus far. This article attends to this gap by following the stories of people with chronic conditions who travel to India for Ayurveda treatment out of dissatisfaction with local biomedical health care. This study expands the focus of current research on transnational therapeutic mobilities in three ways 1 by shifting the attention from being a foreign patient or medical traveler to becoming one, 2 by integrating quests for other-than-biomedical therapies, and 3 by applying a narrative approach to the field. Results show that apart from social, human, and financial resources, it takes certain patient-subjectivities to mobilize patients across borders and healing systems.","According to Of odysseys and miracles A narrative approach on therapeutic mobilities for Ayurveda treatment, people with chronic conditions often travel to India for Ayurveda treatment due to dissatisfaction with their local biomedical healthcare. The decision to travel for treatment is often driven by social, human, and financial resources, as well as specific patient-subjectivities. The paper suggests that a shift in focus is needed from simply being a foreign patient to becoming one, with an integration of quests for therapies outside of biomedicine."

Can participating in an Ayurvedic program like Panchakarma improve my mental health and promote healthier behavior patterns,"Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India, is understudied in western contexts. Using data gathered from an Ayurvedic treatment program, this study examined the role of psychosocial factors in the process of behavior change and the salutogenic process. This observational study examined associations with participation in the 5-day Ayurvedic cleansing retreat program, Panchakarma. Quality of life, psychosocial, and behavior change measurements were measured longitudinally on 20 female participants. Measurements were taken before the start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram. The program did not significantly improve quality of life. Significant improvements were found in self-efficacy towards using Ayurveda to improve health and reported positive health behaviors. In addition, perceived social support and depression showed significant improvements 3 months postprogram after the subjects had returned to their home context. As a program of behavior change, our preliminary results suggest that the complex intervention Panchakarma may be effective in assisting ones expected and reported adherence to new and healthier behavior patterns.","According to the research paper titled Ayurveda and Panchakarma measuring the effects of a holistic health intervention, the Ayurvedic treatment program, Panchakarma, showed significant improvements in self-efficacy towards using Ayurveda to improve health and reported positive health behaviors.

"How can personalized medicine, based on my genetic and biochemical diversity, potentially improve my health","The omics era of research has provided vital information on the genetic and biochemical diversity of individuals. This has lead to the emergence of personalized medicine, wherein one aims to design specific drugs for individual patients or subtypes of patients. Indeed, the ongoing patent wars on this matter, suggest that personalized medicine represents a major goal for todays pharmaceutical industries. Although the concept of personalized medicine is new to modern medicine, it is a well-established concept in Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine that is still being practiced. Therefore, this article discusses topics that are crucial for the advancement of modern personalized medicine. These topics include disease susceptibility, disease subtypes, and Ayurvedic therapeutics. First, we explain how Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Traditional Korean medicine or Sasang Constitutional medicine conceptualize disease susceptibility and disease subtypes. Next, we focus on conceptual similarities between molecular medicine and Ayurvedic concepts of disease susceptibility and disease subtypes. For each topic, we explain the relevant experimental evidence reported in the literature. We also propose new hypotheses and suggest experimental approaches for their testing and validation.","According to Insights on personalized medicine from Ayurveda, Ayurveda, a traditional system of Indian medicine, has been practicing the concept of personalized medicine for centuries.

What are some lifestyle changes suggested by Ayurveda to maintain a balance in body doshas for overall health,"Ayurveda, the science of life, is a comprehensive medical system that has been the traditional system of healthcare in India for more than 5000 years. This medical system was well established around 2500 to 600 BC, when it evolved into 2 schools the School of Physicians and the School of Surgeons, similar to allopathy. Charak Samhita, Susrut Samhita, and Ashtang Hridaya Samhita are the Senior Triad texts, and Madhav Nidan Samhita, Sarangdhar Samhita, and Bhavprakash Samhita are the Junior Triad texts. Around 600 BC. Ayurveda was branched into internal medicine pediatrics psychiatry surgery eye, ear, nose, and throat toxicology geriatrics and eugenicsaphrodisiacs. The body is composed of 3 body doshas, 3 mental doshas, 7 dhatus, and malas. The harmony among the body doshas of vata nervous system, pitta enzymes, and kapha mucus and the gunas, or mental doshas which are human attributes satogun godly, rajas kingly, and tamas evil, constitutes health, and their disharmony constitutes disease. The management of illness requires balancing the doshas back into a harmonious state through lifestyle interventions, spiritual nurturing, and treatment with herbo-mineral formulas based on ones mental and bodily constitution.","According to Ayurveda a historical perspective and principles of the traditional healthcare system in India, Ayurveda is a comprehensive medical system that has been practiced in India for over 5000 years.

How can the principles of Ayurveda be applied to modern medicine to promote overall health and wellness,"Modern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it is practised. The mechanistic model which served biomedicine well for many years is gradually collapsing, thanks to the efforts of dedicated researchers who have looked beyond that models flaws. Thus we now know that networks of chemical communication exist between the nervous and immune systems, and that prayer at a distance can positively affect the conditions of those who are seriously ill, even when the prayer and the patient are not known to one another. Another participant in this exciting climate of change and ferment is Ayurveda, Indias ancient medical system. While Ayurveda has already contributed much to modern medicine reserpine, gugulipid, plastic surgery, its real contributions are yet to be made. While some of these are likely to come in matters of materia medica and technique, most will likely be derived from Ayurvedas way of seeing the world, its darshana. This paper outlines a few of the ways in which Ayurvedas vision is likely to facilitate medicines ability to teach people not just how to avoid disease but how to proactively develop and maintain a healthy state.","According to Ayurvedas role in preventing disease, Ayurveda, Indias ancient medical system, has already made significant contributions to modern medicine, including reserpine, gugulipid, and plastic surgery.

How can the Ayurvedic formulation Triphala potentially help in treating cancer,"Network pharmacology is an emerging technique, which integrates systems biology and computational biology to study multi-component and multi-targeted formulations. Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, uses intelligent formulations however, their scientific rationale and mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the potential of network pharmacology to understand the rationale of a commonly used Ayurveda formulation known as Triphala. We have developed pharmacology networks of Triphala based on the information gathered from different databases and using the software Cytoscape. The networks depict the interaction of bioactives with molecular targets and their relation with diseases, especially cancer. The network pharmacology analysis of Triphala has offered new relationships among bioactives, targets and putative applications of cancer etiology. This pioneering effort might open new possibilities to know pharmacodynamics of Ayurvedic drugs like Triphala and also help in the discovery of new leads and targets for various diseases.","According to Network Pharmacology of Ayurveda Formulation Triphala with Special Reference to Anti-Cancer Property, network pharmacology can be used to understand the scientific rationale and mechanisms of the Ayurveda formulation known as Triphala.

How can incorporating a variety of plant foods in my diet improve my gut health and potentially prevent chronic diseases,"Diet provides macronutrients carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, micronutrients vitamins and minerals, and phytochemicals non-nutrient bioactive compounds. Emerging evidence suggests that above dietary components can directly impact the composition and metabolic activity of the mammalian gut microbiota and in turn, affect both physical and mental health. There is a growing recognition that rise in chronic disease burden in Western countries may due to progressive loss of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity. This perspective explores the possibility of using Indian thali, an ancient approach to diet that provides both fiber and different phytochemicals by incorporating a variety of plant foods in different colors. This variety helps to restore diversity in the gut bacteria and may potentially prevent or reverse chronic disease, such as colon cancer or type 2 diabetes.","According to Ancient Thali Diet Gut Microbiota, Immunity, and Health, the Indian thali diet, an ancient Ayurvedic approach, can directly impact the composition and metabolic activity of the mammalian gut microbiota.

What are some key principles of Ayurveda as mentioned in Garudapurna for maintaining good health,"The Purnas are the encyclopedic works of the ancient and medieval Hindu religion, philosophy, history, politics, ethics, sciences etc. There are 18 Astdaa purnas, which are, considered as mahpurnas, among which Garudapurna is popular one. The Garudapurna is divided into two parts viz., Prvakhanda and Uttarakhanda. The first part, which is also called Acrakhanda consists of 240 chapters. The greater part of the Prvakhanda occupies the descriptions of Vratas religious observances, sacred places dedicated to the Srya sun, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu. It also contains treatises on various aspects like astrology, palmistry, politics, Snkhya, Yga, anatomy, precious stones and extensive information on vedic medicine i.e., Ayurveda. The Uttarakhanda consists of two khandas viz. Dharmakhanda and Brahmakhanda, which are divided into 42 and 29 chapters, respectively. The Dharmakhanda is also known as the Prtakalpa which contains directions for the performance of obsequies rites. The Prtakalpa portion of the Garudapurna is generally recited during the period of mourning and so its importance is self-evident. It is almost impossible to narrate within such a small framework, the wide range of splendid truths scattered in the pages of this noble purnam. Little information is available from internal evidence to establish its exact period. However, it is supposed to be quite ancient in its origin.","According to Introduction to Garudapurna with reference to Ayurvda, the Garudapurna, one of the 18 mahpurnas, provides extensive information on Ayurveda, a form of Vedic medicine. It includes descriptions of religious observances, sacred places, and various treatises on subjects such as astrology, palmistry, politics, Snkhya, Yga, anatomy, and precious stones. The exact period of the Garudapurna is not established but it is considered to be quite ancient in its origin."
What is Swarna bindu prashana and how can it boost an infants immune system,"Swarna bindu prashana SBP is a metallic medicinal preparation widely used in Ayurveda pediatrics. The main ingredients of SBP are swarna prashan gold nanoparticle, gou ghrita cow ghee, madhu honey, and other medhya dravyas drugs which enhance intellectual, memory. According to the Indian classical text, SBP has been proposed as a potent medicine for immunotherapies and vaccine development due to its indefinite size, shapes, charges, and surface functionality. In this review, we describe the plausible mechanism of SBP in dendritic cells maturation and subsequent T cell activation. But being herbo-metallic preparation, its safety and efficacy are well supported by the classical publications of Ayurveda. To conclude, SBP is an immune booster for infants against any viral disease, and it is necessary to validate its safety and efficacy through systematic methodological research.","According to Swarna Bindu Prashana-an Ancient Approach to Improve the Infants Immunity, the Ayurvedic remedy known as Swarna bindu prashana SBP is a metallic medicinal preparation that includes ingredients such as gold nanoparticles, cow ghee, honey, and other drugs that enhance memory and intellect.

What herbs from Ayurveda and Unani medicine can help promote a brighter and whiter complexion,"BACKGROUND In Ayurvedic and Unani texts, many herbs and formulations are mentioned as complexion promoters having skin brightening and whitening effects that downregulate melanin synthesis. However, with the assistance of chromatographic techniques, further validation of scientific standardization is required. OBJECTIVE To validate individual herbs and formulations in the ancient literature, some scientific aspects are to be focused on, including standardization of herbs or herbal products consisting of the active compounds. METHODS Out of many herbs having complexion promoting properties, three herbs Myristica fragrans, Hemidesmus indicus, and Inula racemosa were selected for the study. In the present study, validated reverse phase RP-HPLC and high-performance TLC HPTLC methods were developed for standardization of the herbs. RESULTS It was observed that the quercetin present in M. fragrans was 0.62 ww with a retention time Rt of 6.23 min, the ferulic acid present in H. indicus was 1.39 ww with an Rt of 8.083 min, and the chlorogenic acid present in I. racemosa was 1.03 ww with an Rt of 3.19 min.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments that can help improve symptoms of dementia,"Dementia has been characterized by atypical neurological syndromes and several cognitive deficits, such as extended memory loss, strange behavior, unusual thinking, impaired judgment, impotence, and difficulty with daily living activities. Dementia is not a disease, but it is caused by several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Lewys bodies. Several drugs and remedies are indicated for alleviating unusual cognitive decline, but no effective pharmacological treatment regimens are available without side effects. Herbal drugs or traditional medicines like Ayurveda have been known for facilitating and corroborating the balance between mind, brain, body, and environment. Ayurvedic therapy comprises 600 herbal formulas, 250 single plant remedies, and natural and holistic health-giving treatments that relieve dementia in patients and increase vitality. Ayurvedic Rasayana herbs rejuvenating elements strengthen the brain cells, enhance memory, and decrease stress.

How does Ayurveda adapt to changing health needs in society,"This paper argues that because Ayurveda is commonly approached as a single coherent tradition of medicine characterized predominately by the doctrines, clinical practitioners, and medical infrastructure that supports it, the rich diversity of empirical indigenous medicine available in the daily lives of the Sinhalese is often obscured. Thus the numbers of IMPs, the wide range of services they provide, and the importance of Ayurveda and Sinhala medicine as basic explanatory models of health and illness within the general population may be significantly under-estimated in analyses of Sri Lankas medical system. In practice, Ayurveda is a dynamic phenomenon that offers multifaceted approaches to healing. These diverse healing formats develop to meet the constantly changing needs of the society and of illness patterns. This analysis views illness and health care in terms of the multiple systems of knowledge and action, phenomena and interaction, that characterize them as well as in terms of the medical treatises and institutions that formalize them. In this light, Ayurveda emerges as a plural medical system in itself. As such, it remains a fundamental means of defining and treating illness in Sri Lanka.","According to Exploring pluralism--the many faces of Ayurveda, Ayurveda is a plural medical system that offers multifaceted approaches to health and healing. This system is dynamic and evolves to meet the changing needs of society and illness patterns.

However, the importance of Ayurveda and its wide range of services may be significantly under-estimated in analyses of Sri Lankas medical system."
What role do sugars play in the effectiveness of traditional medicines,"Traditional medicine systems around the globe, like Unani, Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, include a number of sugar-based formulations, which contain a large amount of saccharide-containing sweetener, such as honey, sucrose or jaggery. With pervasive lifestyle disorders throughout the world, there have been discussions to consider alternative sweetening agents. Here, from the perspective of Unani medicine, we discuss how the saccharide-based sweeteners may be an essential component of these traditional preparations, like electuaries, which may be deprived of their bioactivities without these saccharides. With contemporary researches, it is known that apart from their own therapeutic effects, saccharides also form deep eutectic solvents which help in enhancing the bioactivity of other ingredients present in crude drugs. In addition, they provide energy for fermentation which is essential for biotransformation of compounds. Interestingly, the sugars also increase the shelf-life of these compound drugs and act as natural preservatives. On the basis of this review, we strongly believe that saccharide-based sweeteners are an essential component of traditional medicines and not merely an excipient.","According to Why the sugars in traditional Unani formulations are a pivotal component A viewpoint perspective, saccharide-based sweeteners like honey, sucrose, or jaggery are not just excipients but essential components in traditional medicines such as Unani and Ayurveda. Apart from their own therapeutic effects, these saccharides form deep eutectic solvents which enhance the bioactivity of other ingredients in the medicine. They provide energy for fermentation which is crucial for the biotransformation of compounds. Additionally, they increase the shelf-life of these medicines and act as natural preservatives."

What should I consider when using ayurvedic medicines for chronic conditions,"Traditional Indian medicine ayurveda is becoming increasingly popular, with many chronic conditions responding to it well. Most patients begin to take conventional medications as soon as their diagnoses are made, so ayurvedic treatments are usually undergone alongside andor after conventional medical approaches. A detailed knowledge of the action of food, spices, and medicinal plants is needed in order to understand their potential influence fully. While societal use of ayurvedic plants and Indian spices is commonplace, without ill effect, the use of more concentrated products made from single plants, often in the form of teas or tablets, is of more concern. The mechanisms by which polyherbal drugs and their extracts act differ in many respects from the actions of single substances or synthetic drugs. Despite the fact that ayurvedic medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their method of administration, taking into account individuals needs and their specific disease conditions.","According to The Significance of Ayurvedic Medicinal Plants, Ayurvedic remedies are often used in conjunction with conventional medications for the treatment of various chronic conditions. The effectiveness of these remedies depends on a detailed understanding of the properties of food, spices, and medicinal plants. Ayurvedic treatments can come in the form of teas or tablets made from single plants however, their safety and effectiveness depend on the method of administration and the specific needs and disease conditions of the individual. It is also important to note that the actions of Ayurvedic polyherbal drugs and their extracts can differ greatly from those of single substances or synthetic drugs."
Can Ayurveda provide personalized health advice based on my unique genetic makeup,"Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine documented and practised since 1500 B.C., follows a systems approach that has interesting parallels with contemporary personalized genomic medicine approaches to the understanding and management of health and disease. It is based on the trisutra, which are the three aspects of causes, features and therapeutics that are interconnected through a common organizing principle termed tridosha. Tridosha comprise three ascertainable physiological entities vata kinetic, pitta metabolic and kapha potential that are pervasive across systems, work in conjunction with each other, respond to the external environment and maintain homeostasis. Each individual is born with a specific proportion of tridosha that are not only genetically determined but also influenced by the environment during foetal development. Jointly they determine a persons basic constitution, which is termed their prakriti. Development and progressi on of different diseases with their subtypes are thought to depend on the origin and mechanism of perturbation of the doshas, and the aim of therapeutic practice is to ensure that the doshas retain their homeostatic state. Similarly, western systems biology epitomized by translational P4 medicine envisages the integration of multiscalar genetic, cellular, physiological and environmental networks to predict phenotypic outcomes of perturbations. In this perspective article, we aim to outline the shape of a unifying scaffold that may allow the two intellectual traditions to enhance one another. Specifically, we illustrate how a unique integrative Ayurgenomics approach can be used to integrate the trisutra concept of Ayurveda with genomics. We observe biochemical and molecular correlates of prakriti and show how these differ significantly in processes that are linked to intermediate patho-phenotypes, known to take different course in diseases. We also observe a significant enr ichment of the highly connected hub genes which could explain differences in prakriti, focussing on EGLN1, a key oxygen sensor that differs between prakriti types and is linked to high altitude adaptation. Integrating our observation with the current literature, we demonstrate how EGLN1 could qualify as a molecular equivalent of tridosha that can modulate different phenotypic outcomes, where hypoxia is a cause or a consequence both during health and diseased states. Our studies affirm that integration of the trisutra framework through Ayurgenomics can guide the identification of predisposed groups of individuals and enable discovery of actionable therapeutic points in an individualized manner.","According to Genomic insights into ayurvedic and western approaches to personalized medicine, Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, is based on a concept known as the tridosha which consists of three physiological entities vata kinetic, pitta metabolic and kapha potential. These entities are pervasive across systems and work together to maintain homeostasis. Each individual is born with a specific proportion of these doshas which are genetically determined and influenced by the environment during foetal development.

What is the role of traditional Chinese medicine in modern patient-centered care,"Elements of whole medical systems WMSs are re-emerging in a modern, patient-centered care model that leverages the benefits of evidence-based conventional medical practice with WMSs modalities. Many of these re-emerging modalities had their origins in traditional Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medicine, homeopathy, or naturopathy. To date, research has been conducted predominantly on multimodality treatment of experimental groups, drawing conclusions without a comparative control group or using modalities that are not actually WMSs.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedies."
How can traditional Ayurvedic medicine and Western medicine work together for better health outcomes,"Complementary medicine systems are ascending to rapid popularity as the twenty-first century progresses. Often adapted from ancient systems of healing such as Ayurveda, these modern alternative medical movements reappraise millennia-old health traditions that found their inception at the confluence of religious philosophy and herbal healing. Naturally, contemporary global economic forces and a desire to market traditional medicine products in an enticing fashion have characterised how historic traditional medicine systems are presented in the modern context. By establishing a vision of complementary medicine born from ancient traditions, it becomes clear how traditional methods of healing can contend with Western biomedicine-the prevailing standard of care around the globe. The claims made by both sides parry along a line of scientific validity, efficacy and regulatory purview. India, the birthplace of Ayurveda and an epicentre of contemporary medical education, is a prime arena to study the friction between biomedicine and traditional medicine. In this piece, I focus on the modernisation of Ayurveda and how it has found conflict with allopathic medicine. I posit that Ayurveda has re-emerged since the early twentieth century as a key tenet of Indian modernity and in doing so has found contention with Western medicine. I furthermore argue that despite existing discord, the two medical traditions are not inherently antithetical. They can be synergistic, so long as healthcare delivery and education recognise the limits of each and focus on coaction rather than contradiction.","According to research, The research paper does not provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedies. However, it does discuss the modernisation of Ayurveda and its potential synergy with Western medicine when healthcare delivery and education systems recognise the limits of each and focus on collaboration rather than contradiction. This is found in Contention and collaboration the tenuous encounter of modern Ayurveda and Western medicine in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries."

What are some plant-based remedies that can help manage asthma symptoms,"Asthma is a common disease that is rising in prevalence worldwide with the highest prevalence in industrialized countries. Asthma affects about 300 million people worldwide and it has been estimated that a further 100 million will be affected by 2025. Since the ancient times, plants have been exemplary sources of medicine. Current asthma therapy lack satisfactory success due to adverse effect, hence patients are seeking complementary and alternative medicine to treat their asthma. Ayurveda and other Indian literature mention the use of plants in various human ailments. India has about 45,000 plant species and among them several thousand are claimed to possess medicinal properties. Researches conducted in the last few decades on the plants mentioned in ancient literature or used traditionally for asthma have shown antiasthmatic, antihistaminic and antiallergic activity.

How can nano-ayurvedic medicine potentially help in treating cancer,"Nano-ayurvedic medicine is an emerging field in which nanoparticles are functionalized with active principles of potent ayurvedic herbs to enhance their efficacy and target-specific delivery. Scientific advances in the past couple of decades have revealed the molecular mechanisms behind the anticancer potential of several ayurvedic herbs, attributed chiefly to their secondary metabolites including polyphenols and other active substances. With the advancement of nanotechnology, it has been established that size-, shape-, and surface-chemistry-optimized nanoparticles can be utilized as synergizing carriers for these phytochemicals. Nano-ayurvedic medicine utilizes herbs that are commonly used in Ayurveda to functionalize different nanoparticles and thereby enhance their potency and target specificity. Studies have shown that the active phytochemicals of such herbs can be coated onto the nanoparticles of different metals, such as gold, and that they work more efficiently than the free herbal extract, for example, in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Recently, an Ayurveda, Yoga Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy AYUSH-based clinical trial in humans indicated the anticancer potential of such formulations. Nano-ayurvedic medicine is emerging as a potential treatment option for hyperproliferative diseases.","According to Nano-ayurvedic medicine and its potential in cancer treatment, nano-ayurvedic medicine is an emerging field that enhances the efficacy and target-specific delivery of potent Ayurvedic herbs.

Can Ayurvedic therapy help with chronic urinary retention in elderly patients,"INTRODUCTION Neurogenic bladder is a common urological condition among elderly. It results in incontinence or retention of the urine depending on the synergy of bladder smooth muscles and urethral sphincter. There can also be a condition where retention causes overflow incontinence. Retention of urine in this condition is caused by relative lack of contractility of bladder smooth muscles in response to the stretch reflex. As a result, there is no urge and therefore the bladder remains over-distended causing retention of urine. Currently, there are no absolute ways to deal with such a situation except that the patients are advised for self-help techniques of regularly evacuating the bladder. Pharmacotherapy for such condition is not promising. As the patients of neurogenic bladder are often healthy otherwise with manageable conditions such as diabetes, a bladder dysfunction is considered as a disability that they do not want to share. In this state, any approach that offers a regeneration of bladder reflex and restoration of its functions is more than one can expect for. METHODS An elderly male suffering with chronic urinary retention recommended for indwelling catheterization after the failure of voiding trial following the possible conventional pharmacotherapy was treated with Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS There was a complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic therapy. The changes were stable after 3-month follow-up of the patient. CONCLUSION This case report presents the complete symptom reversal in a case of chronic urine retention as an outcome of Ayurvedic therapy. Seeing the importance of this clinical condition and unavailability of sufficient means in conventional medicine, it requires a serious note and enquiry into its applicability in similar cases.","According to Low-Pressure, Low-Flow Voiding Dysfunction in an Elderly Male Treated Through Ayurveda A Case Report, an elderly male suffering from chronic urinary retention, who was recommended for indwelling catheterization after the failure of conventional pharmacotherapy, was treated successfully with Ayurvedic therapy.

What is the historical basis of Ayurvedic medicine in India,"This review focuses on how the study of anatomy in India has evolved through the centuries. Anatomical knowledge in ancient India was derived principally from animal sacrifice, chance observations of improperly buried human bodies, and examinations of patients made by doctors during treatment. The Vedic philosophies form the basis of the Ayurvedic tradition, which is considered to be one of the oldest known systems of medicine. Two sets of texts form the foundation of Ayurvedic medicine, the Susruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita. The Susruta Samhita provided important surgical and anatomical information of the understanding of anatomy by Indians in the 6th century BCE. Here we review the anatomical knowledge known to this society.","According to Anatomy in ancient India a focus on the Susruta Samhita, the Ayurvedic tradition, one of the oldest known systems of medicine, is based on Vedic philosophies. The key texts that form the foundation of Ayurvedic medicine include the Susruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita. The Susruta Samhita, in particular, provides crucial surgical and anatomical information, reflecting the understanding of anatomy by Indians in the 6th century BCE."
Is it safe to take Ayurvedic supplements for a long period of time,"BACKGROUND Complementary and alternative medicine use among Americans is prevalent. Originating in India, Ayurvedic medicine use in the United States has grown 57 since 2002. CAM accounts for a significant proportion of drug induced liver injury in India and China, but there have been only three reports of drug induced liver injury from Ayurvedic medications in the U.S. We report three cases of suspected Ayurvedic medication associated liver injury seen at a Southern California community hospital and review literature of Ayurvedic medication induced liver injury. CASE PRESENTATIONS Three patients presented with acute hepatocellular injury and jaundice after taking Ayurvedic supplements for 90-120 days. First patient took Giloy Kwath consisting solely of Tinospora cordifolia. Second patient took Manjishthadi Kwatham and Aragwadhi Kwatham, which contained 52 and 10 individual plant extracts, respectively. Third patient took Kanchnar Guggulu, containing 10 individual plant extracts. Aminotransferase activities decreased 50 in 30 days and all 3 patients made a full recovery. Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method RUCAM scores were 7-8, indicating probable causality. These products all contained ingredients in other Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines with previously reported associations with drug induced liver injury.

What are some Ayurvedic practices or herbs that can help improve memory and brain health,"Ayurveda is the oldest system of Medicine in the world, its antiquity going back to the Vedas. It adapts a unique holistic approach to the entire science of life, health and cure. The areas of special consideration in Ayurveda are geriatrics, rejuvenation, nutrition, immunology, genetics and higher consciousness. The Ayurvedic texts describe a set of rejuvenative measures to impart biological sustenance to the bodily tissues. These remedies are called Rasayana which are claimed to act as micronutrients. Some of these Rasayanas are organ and tissue specific. Those specific to brain tissue are called Medhya Rasayana. Such Rasayanas retard brain aging and help in regeneration of neural tissues besides producing antistress, adaptogenic and memory enhancing effect.

"What are some alternative, natural therapies for managing neuropathic pain","Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic pain state accompanied by tissue injury and nerve damage. This important health issue constitutes a challenge for the modern medicine worldwide. The management of neuropathic pain remains a major clinical challenge, pertaining to an inadequate understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain. Various classes of drugs have been reported effective for the management of neuropathic pain viz. opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, and antiepileptic agents. However, association of adverse effects with these drugs hinders their confident prescription in people with neuropathic pain. Recently, various medicinal plants have been reported effective for the management of neuropathic pain. So, it may be prudent to look beyond synthetic drugs pertaining to their unprecedented pharmacotherapeutic effects with lesser adverse effects. The extensive literature review has been carried out from databases such as Science direct, Scifinder, Wiley online library, PubMed, Research gate, Google scholar and Chemical Abstracts. The list of Traditional Indian Medicinal plants TIMPs and isolated compounds have been compiled which have been reported effective as an alternative therapy for the management of neuropathic pain.

What are some traditional uses of the Aucklandia costus plant for health issues,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Aucklandia costus Falc. a medicinal plant is native to the Himalayan region and synonymous with Saussurea costus, Saussurea lappa, and Aucklandia lappa. It has an ancient background of being used ethnopharmacologically for various body ailments. According to Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Costus roots are recommended for leukoderma, liver, kidney, blood disorders, Qi stagnation, and tridosha. Root and powder are used orally with warm water to cure gastric problems, and the paste is applied to the inflamed area to relieve pain. Root paste is applied on the skin to cure boils, blisters, and leprosy. AIM OF THE STUDY The aim of the present review is to establish a correlation among the ethnopharmacological uses and scientific studies conducted on A. costus with chemical constituents, safety toxicity data including future directions for its conservation with higher yield and effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted by studying books, research papers, and literature in history, agroforestry, phytopharmacology of Himalayan plants using international databases, publication, Red data book, and reports. The search engines Pubmed, Scopus, Wiley Inter-science, Indian Materia Medica, Science Direct, and referred journals are referenced. RESULTS The literature collected from databases, journals, websites, and books mentioned the use of costus roots in local and traditional practices. CITES included A. costus in a critically endangered category due to lack of cultural practices and overexploitation from wild. A. costus roots are known since 13th century for use in ancient Ayurvedic products but the scientific evaluation is of future research interest. A correlation of traditional uses with scientific studies has been explored to assess the effect of root powder, extract, oil and isolated constituents Costunolids, Saussureamine B and Dehydrocostus lactone etc. in gastric ulceration and lesions inhibition of antigen-induced degranulation, mucin production, number of immune cells, eosinophils, and expression and secretion of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in asthma. The inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators is also reported by Cynaropicrin, Alantolactone, Caryophyllene, Costic acid. Also, the sesquiterpene lactones has profound effect in inhibition of inflammatory stages and induced apoptotic cascades in cancer. Very few data on the safety and toxicity of plant parts have been noted which needs to be evaluated scientifically. CONCLUSION A. costus have been noted to have remarkable effect for gastric, hepatic, inflammatory, respiratory, cancer, skin problems but there were several errors in selection of plant material, authentification, selection of dose, assessment, selection of standard and control have been identified. Therefore, a schematic drug development and research strategy exploiting the potential of plant extract, fraction, products and probable constituents, costunolide, dehydrocostus lactone, cynaropicrin, saussureamine assuring dose-response relationship and safety may be determined under pre-clinical which may be extrapolated to clinical level.

How can astrology guide the timing of taking medicines for better health,"Astrology is the art of predicting or determining the influence of the planets and stars on human affairs. The origin of this word is from Greek word astron, star logos discourse. Both Ayurveda and Astrology have established a way of life in India since time immemorial. Highly advanced knowledge related to Astrology on medicine is preserved in Indian Holy scriptures and transmitted from generation to generation. Although both Astrology and medicine were developed as a part of religion in ancient India, astrological principles related to prevention, health care and relief from illness were applied as rituals religious ceremonies. An astrologer gives guidance for taking medicines at suitable time for the best remedy of ailments. Even the medicinal herbs were collected and used at appropriate times for their efficacy. Astrology and Ayurveda are inseparable in human life. Role of the Astrology in healthy life and pathogenesis of the disease is well known to Indians. When a physician knows etiology of the disease, he attempts to treat the disease with specific medication, diet and life style and also avoiding causative factors. In a case where a physician is unable to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to treat, the patient depends upon Astrology. Account of good and bad deeds during this life and previous lives, their consequences of health or ill health during this life which orderly, when, what and how will be clearly known through Astrology. It gives guidelines about welfare not only to human being but also to whole creation and also indicates about calamities and their solutions as possible extent. Hence a concise astrological evaluation related to prevention, health care, diagnosis and treatment of diseases is being presented in this article.","According to Contribution of astrology in medicine -- a review, astrology and Ayurveda are closely linked in their approach to health and disease prevention. Astrological principles guide the timing of medicine intake and the collection and use of medicinal herbs for optimal efficacy. In cases where the cause of a disease is unclear, patients may turn to astrology for guidance. Astrology can provide insight into the effects of a persons actions from their current and past lives on their health. It also offers guidance on overall welfare and potential solutions to calamities."
What is the impact of Astangahrdayasamhita on modern Tibetan and Mongolian medicine practices,"Astangahrdayasamhita, transmitted into the region of Tibet and Mongolia as Buddist Scripture, is a classical work of ancient Indian medicine. It has had an important influence on the formation of the theoretical system of Tibetan medicine and Mongolian medicine.

How are some psychiatrists in India incorporating local healing practices into their treatment methods,"Medical anthropologists have not paid enough attention to the variation at the level of the individual practitioners of biomedicine, and anthropological critiques of biomedical psychiatry as it is practiced in settings outside the Global North have tended to depict psychiatrists in monolithic terms. In this article, we attempt to demonstrate that, at least in the case of India, some psychiatrists perceive limitations in the biomedical model and the cultural assumptions behind biomedical practices and ideologies. This paper focuses on three practitioners who supplement their own practices with local and alternative healing modalities derived from South Asian psychologies, philosophies, systems of medicine and religious and ritual practices. The diverging psychiatric practices in this paper represent a rough continuum. They range from a bold and confident psychiatrist who uses various techniques including ritual healing to another who yearns to incorporate more Indian philosophy and psychology in psychiatric practice and encourages students of ayurvedic medicine to more fully embrace the science they are learning to a less proactive psychiatrist who does not describe a desire to change his practice but who is respectful and accepting of ayurvedic treatments that some patients also undergo. Rather than simply applying a hegemonic biomedical psychiatry, these psychiatrists offer the possibility of a more locally-attuned, context sensitive psychiatric practice.","According to Curiosity and Creative Experimentation Among Psychiatrists in India, some psychiatrists in India perceive limitations in the biomedical model and supplement their practices with local and alternative healing modalities derived from South Asian psychologies, philosophies, systems of medicine and religious and ritual practices. These include incorporating more Indian philosophy and psychology in psychiatric practice and encouraging students of ayurvedic medicine to more fully embrace the science they are learning. Some are respectful and accepting of ayurvedic treatments that patients also undergo. These practices offer the possibility of a more locally-attuned, context sensitive psychiatric practice."
What were some common treatments for mental illness in nineteenth-century India,"The article documents medical approaches to mental illness in mid- to late-nineteenth-century India through examining the Indian Medical Gazette and other medical accounts. By the late nineteenth century, psychiatry in Europe moved from discussions around asylum-based care to a nuanced and informed debate about the nature of mental symptoms. This included ideas on phrenology and craniometry, biological and psycho-social causes, physical and drug treatments, many of which travelled to India. Simultaneously, indigenous socio-medical ideas were being debated. From the early to the mid-nineteenth century, not much distinction was made between the Western and the native mind, and consequently the diagnosis and investigation of mental symptoms did not differ. However, by the late nineteenth century Western medicine considered the Western mind as more civilized and sophisticated than the native mind.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific information on Ayurvedic remedies."
What are the benefits of using Ayurvedic medicines over synthetic drugs,"Pharmaceutical is one of the allied branches of science, which is closely associated with Medical science. Today pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmacognosy are playing important role in treatment for a disease and its prevention. Herbal medicines are being used by about 80 of the world population mostly in the developing countries in the primary health care. There has been an upsurge in demand for the Phyto-pharmaceutical products of Ayurvda in western nations, because of the fact that the synthetic drugs are considered to be unsafe. Due to this many national and multinational pharmaceutical companies are now concentrating on manufacturing of Ayurvdic Phyto-pharmaceutical products. Ayurvda is the Indian traditional system of medicine, which also deals about pharmaceutical science. The Ayurvdic knowledge of the pharmaceutical science is scattered in Ayurvdic classical texts. Sranghadhara Samhita, which is written by Sranghadhara, explain systematically about the information of the Ayurvdic pharmaceutical science and also updated it. Industrialized manufacturing of Ayurvdic dosage forms has brought in new challenges like deviation from basic concepts of medicine preparation. Sranghadhara Samrhit the devout text on pharmaceutics in Ayurvda comes handy to solve such problems, as the methods described are very lucid and easy to follow.","According to Basic principles of pharmaceutical science in Ayurvda, Ayurvedic remedies are becoming increasingly popular, especially as synthetic drugs are often considered unsafe. This has led to a rise in the manufacturing of Ayurvedic Phyto-pharmaceutical products by both national and multinational pharmaceutical companies. The Ayurvedic knowledge of pharmaceutical science is primarily sourced from Ayurvedic classical texts, such as the Sranghadhara Samhita. This text provides comprehensive information about Ayurvedic pharmaceutical science and offers easy to follow methods for the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines. However, industrialized manufacturing of these medicines can deviate from the basic concepts of medicine preparation."
What are some steps we can take to ensure the Ayurvedic herbs we purchase are not adulterated,"The present market for herbal drugs is estimated about 40 billion, which is expected to increase by 16 in next 3-4 years. The current production of many Ayurvedic herbs is less than their market demand, which incentivizes adulteration in the Ayurvedic drug supply chain. The present work aims to highlight the most used Ayurvedic plants that have been listed in the International Union for Conservation of Natures red list of endangered or vulnerable plants. The future of Ayurvedic medicines from these listed plants is uncertain, as the collection of herbs from their natural habitat is prohibited and their cultivation does not meet market demands. Many of these plants, such as Taxus baccata and T. wallichiana, are endangered and are only grown in their natural habitats their cultivation in other areas is impractical. This is the present state, and will worsen as demand continues to grow, with increasing populations and increasing adoption of this system of medicine. It is possible that in coming years most of the Ayurvedic drugs will be adulterated, and will cause only side effects rather than the therapeutic effects. The Ayurvedic fundamentals are under-explored areas where the Ayurvedic practitioners and research scientists can work together. The scientific work on the basic principles will unravel many unknown or little-known facts of this ancient science. Hence, the present review emphasizes the conservation of Ayurvedic herbs, minimization of the use of medicinal plants and the promotion of the research based on Ayurvedic fundamentals.","According to Status of Indian medicinal plants in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the future of Ayurvedic drugs Shouldnt think about Ayurvedic fundamentals, the future of Ayurvedic medicines derived from plants listed as endangered or vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Natures red list is uncertain. The collection of these herbs from their natural habitats is prohibited and their cultivation does not meet market demands. Some of these plants, such as Taxus baccata and T. wallichiana, are endangered and can only be grown in their natural habitats. The paper suggests that more Ayurvedic drugs may be adulterated in the future due to increased demand. It emphasizes the need for conservation of Ayurvedic herbs"

The GoI has recently regulated all the systems under AYUSH, except Yoga Naturopathy, through the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine NCISM Bill, 2020 1. However, YN has been left out from the NCISM Bill, despite the recommendations of the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill, 2019 2 p 20, and NITI Aayog 3 p 15.

What factors contributed to the rise of Siddha medicine in colonial India,"This essay aims to situate the emergence of Siddha medicine as a separate medical system in the erstwhile Madras Presidency of colonial India within a broader socio-economic context. Scholars who have worked on Siddha medicine have stressed more on political dimensions like nationalism and sub-nationalism with inadequate attention to the interplay of various other factors including contemporary global developments, changes in the attitude of the colonial State and especially to the new promises held by the greater deference shown to indigenous medical systems from the 1920s. If the construction of national medicine based on the Sanskrit texts and the accompanying marginalisation of regional texts and practices were the only reasons for the emergence of Siddha medicine as presented by scholars, it leaves open the question as to why this emergence happened only during the third decade of the twentieth century, though the marginalisation processes started during the first decade itself. This paper seeks to find an answer by analysing the formation of Siddha medical identity beyond the frameworks of nationalism and sub-nationalism. Further, it explicates how material factors served as immediate cause along with the other, and more ideational factors related to the rise of the Dravidian political and cultural movement.","According to research, The paper Rise of Siddha medicine causes and constructions in the Madras Presidency 1920-1930s does not provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedies. The focus of the paper is the socio-economic and political factors that contributed to the emergence of Siddha medicine as a separate medical system in colonial India during the 1920s."
What are some proactive steps I can take to improve my overall health through Ayurvedic medicine,"Because most scholars take it for granted that medicine is concerned with healing and problems of ill health, the way in which various medical systems define good health has not been adequately studied. Moreover, good health as such is usually regarded as a natural, normative state of being even by most medical anthropologists, who otherwise take a critical, relativist perspective on the subject of illness, pain, and disease. Using the case of Ayurvedic medicine, this article shows that there is a very different way of looking at the question of how health is embodied. This perspective is proactive and concerned with overall fitness rather than reactive and primarily concerned with either illness or disease. The argument presented here therefore seeks to go beyond the limiting--although extremely useful--orientation of remedial health care and suggest a radical challenge to some of the most basic ontological assumptions in the cross-cultural comparative study of medical systems.","According to research, The paper doesnt provide specific Ayurvedic remedies. However, it does discuss the Ayurvedic perspective on health, which is proactive and focused on overall fitness rather than just addressing illness or disease. This suggests that Ayurvedic medicine may involve preventive measures and practices that promote general well-being. This perspective challenges some basic assumptions in the comparative study of medical systems.

What are some quality standards for Unani medicines in India,"Compliance with pharmacopeial standards is mandatory to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines. In India, allopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy are the recognized systems of medicine and come under the provisions of different regulations.

Can Ayurvedic treatments be evaluated using modern scientific methods,"Despite its ancient roots and prominence in India as an accepted alternative to modern medicine, Ayurvedas growth has been hampered by an inability to carry out clinical studies of its effectiveness and safety using modern scientific methods - while preserving the core of Ayurveda, which is personalised medicine. In this comment, we propose that the N-of-1 trial be used as a practical method to evaluate Ayurvedic treatments, which is simultaneously consistent with the canons of modern medicine and of Ayurveda. We emphasise the importance of doing this as a practical alternative that will benefit patients. We need not wait to resolve the epistemic inconsistency between Ayurveda and modern medicine to take steps in this direction.","According to Scientific evaluation of Ayurvedic drugs - the use of N-of-1 clinical trials, the N-of-1 trial could be used as a practical method to evaluate Ayurvedic treatments in a way that is consistent with both modern medicine and the principles of Ayurveda.

What are the key principles of Ayurvedic treatment for maintaining good health,"Ayurveda, the indigenous medical system of India, has integrated the concept of interconnectedness into its understanding of health and disease. It considers the human body as an indivisible whole with a network of interrelated functions, mind and consciousness, wherein a disturbance in one part will have repercussions in other parts as well. The key to health is for these factors to maintain stability since disease is seen as a perturbation in this network. Ayurvedic treatment aims not only at removal of disease, but also at the restoration of the equilibrium of bodily functions. The centuries-old science of Ayurveda, apart from being a holistic form of medicine, also clearly defines the student-teacher and doctor-patient relationship. It sets high ethical standards of professional and personal integrity for the doctor, teacher and student. In addition to being technically skilled and well-read in the science, practitioners of Ayurveda must be compassionate and empathetic. Students of Ayurveda are taught the importance of compassionate caring for patients and maintaining personal integrity.","According to Healthcare the Ayurvedic way, Ayurvedic treatment focuses on the restoration of the equilibrium of bodily functions and the removal of disease.

What lifestyle modifications does Ayurveda suggest for people with epilepsy,"This article discusses etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, and treatment of epilepsy, as described in Charaka Samhit translation Charakas Compendium and Sushruta Samhit, the two core texts of Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine. Ayurveda emphasized amnesia and loss of consciousness as core features of epileptic seizures Sanskrit apasmar translation apa negation, smaran memory and recognized that seizures occur due to a disturbance in brain function or flow of humors to the brain. Semiology of various seizure types was well described. Epilepsy was attributed to both internal and multiple exogenous factors. Treatment of epilepsy with formulations of naturally occurring substances, their compounding and use, is described in remarkable detail. Lifestyle modifications to protect people with epilepsy are also documented. Cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy were recognized. Although none of the Ayurveda formulations have any empirical evidence supporting their safety or efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy, studies are needed to generate relevant evidence, to recognize their hazards, and to integrate traditional and complementary systems of medicine with modern health care in an informed and safe manner.","According to Ancient Indian concepts about phenomenology, biology, and therapeutics of epilepsy, Ayurvedic texts describe the treatment of epilepsy with formulations of naturally occurring substances and recommend lifestyle modifications to help those with epilepsy. Although there is currently no empirical evidence to support the safety or efficacy of these Ayurvedic remedies, the texts recognize the cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy and suggest that seizures occur due to disruptions in brain function or the flow of humors to the brain."
Can Bacopa monnieri improve memory and cognitive abilities,"Bacopa monnieri L. Wettst. BM has been traditionally used in Ayurveda for improving memory and cognitive deficits which is also evidenced through experimental and clinical studies. The neuropharmacological properties of BM are attributed to bacosides, a complex mixture of saponin compounds. BM extracts enriched with bacosides offers commercial advantage due to perceived higher efficacy. However, there is no scientific data to support the same. In the present study, methanolic extract of BM BME was compared with bacosides enriched BME-EF vis a vis bacosides free fraction BME-FF. Potential antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity has been evaluated using in vitro and in vivo methods. BME showed not only the highest anti-amnesic efficacy but also antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity, followed by either BME-FF or BME-EF. Interestingly, no significant differences were found in between the groups. These findings dispel the notion that bacosides enrichment enhances anti-amnesic efficacy and also suggests the contribution of other components.","According to Bacosides enrichment does not improve the anti-amnesic effect of Bacopa monnieri behavioural and biochemical evidences, Bacopa monnieri BM, traditionally used in Ayurveda for improving memory and cognitive deficits, has been investigated. The neuropharmacological properties of BM are attributed to bacosides, a mixture of saponin compounds. However, the study found that the methanolic extract of BM BME showed the highest anti-amnesic efficacy, antioxidant, and cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The enrichment of bacosides did not enhance the anti-amnesic efficacy, suggesting that other components in BM contribute to its effectiveness."
How can Ayurvedic medicine be used to combat iron and iodine deficiencies in women,"Bangladesh is now facing the public health problems of deficiency of iron and iodine, especially for women. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh has implemented strong countermeasures to enhance the health condition of the nation. On the other hand, based on the concept of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, complementary and alternative medicine should be used more vigorously to enhance public health in the world. The usage of complementary and alternative medicine such as ayurvedic medicine AM should be increased in Bangladesh. Therefore we conducted the study on perceptions of AM by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh in order to promote and enhance the effective usage of AM, including herbal medicines as medical resources, from December 2010 to January 2011. This study showed younger citizens 61.1 did not get more benefit from AM than elder citizens 48.0. On the other hand, younger citizens 76.8 did not get more harm from AM than elder citizens 70.1. We think that in terms of effectiveness of AM, the younger generation in Dhaka seems to be more skeptical to AM than the elder generation in Dhaka, even though the younger generation are more satisfied with AM than the elder generation. With viewpoint of enhancement of usage of AM in Dhaka, we think that scientifically sound information on AM should be collected rigorously and brought to the citizens vigorously to remove the skeptical feeling of AM from younger citizen in Dhaka. In terms of the effective utilization of limited medical resources, AM should be used appropriately in Bangladesh, Asia and the world.","According to Perceptions of Ayurvedic medicine by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the study suggests that there is a need to promote the usage of Ayurvedic Medicine, including herbal medicines, as a complementary and alternative medical resource in Bangladesh, especially to address public health problems like iron and iodine deficiencies.

What is the tridosha theory in Ayurveda and how does it relate to overall health,"It has been said that the tridosha theory in Ayurveda originated from the theory of the three elements of the universe. The names of these three doshas, which are roughly equivalent to humour, are vata wind, pitta bile, and Kapha phlegm, corresponding to the three elements of the universe air, fire, and water. On the other hand, Buddhist medicine which has a close relation to Ayurveda is based on the theory of the four elements of the universe which includes the earth as well as the three elements mentioned above. Greek medicine on the other hand, is founded on the theory of the four humours, i.e. blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Furthermore, even in Ayurveda, like in Sushruta Samhita, the theory of the four humours can be found this includes the above-mentioned tridosha plus blood as the fourth humour. Timaios by Plato also mentions this. We compared these various theories and pointed out that the tridosha theory had its origin in the theory of the four elements of the universe. The process of the formation of the tridosha theory is considered as follows 1 Earth was segregated from the four elements of the universe owing to its solid properties, and was rearranged into the seven elements of the body called dhatu and the other three elements. water, fire, and air, were integrated as the tridosha theory, namely, the theory of the three humours, owing to their properties of fluid 2 Blood, assigned to the element of earth, was segregated from the tridosha because blood was considered to be comprised of the properties of every humour without having its own peculiar properties. Therefore, the diseases caused by deranged blood were regarded as an aggregate disease caused by the other three deranged humours. Then the category of the disease, caused by deranged earth, did not appear.","According to Comparative studies of the tridosha theory in Ayurveda and the theory of the four deranged elements in Buddhist medicine, Ayurveda is based on the tridosha theory which originates from the theory of the three elements of the universe air, fire, and water. These correspond to the three doshas, vata wind, pitta bile, and Kapha phlegm. The process of formation of the tridosha theory involved segregating Earth from the four elements due to its solid properties, and integrating water, fire, and air into the tridosha theory due to their fluid properties. The fourth element, blood, was considered to have properties"
What initiatives are being taken by the Indian government to promote the use of AYUSH in public healthcare,"The double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases is a major threat to the Indian public health system. AYUSH, an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy, represents the Indian system of medicine recognized by the Government of India. Mainstreaming of AYUSH is one of the key strategies of the Indian government for tackling increasing disease burden through initiatives such as AYUSH wellness centers, telemedicine, and quality control measures for medications in the AYUSH system of medicine. Such investment of resources in health systems may require economic evaluations. However, such evaluations are lacking in the AYUSH system, except for a few in homeopathy and yoga. In the absence of evidence from economic evaluations, researchers and decision makers are guided mostly by clinical efficacy while formulating healthcare strategies. In view of the increasing use of AYUSH across the country, economic evaluations of the AYUSH system are the need of the hour to aid healthcare decision making.","According to Promoting health economic evaluation studies in the AYUSH system of medicine the need of the hour, the AYUSH system, which includes Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy, is a key strategy of the Indian government to counter the increasing disease burden. Initiatives under the AYUSH system include wellness centers, telemedicine, and quality control measures for medications. However, more economic evaluations of the AYUSH system are needed to aid healthcare decision making."

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for reducing symptoms of fever and burning sensations in the body,"Hot Ushna and cold sheet are two fundamental precepts of Ayurvedic medicine reflected variously within the context of health and disease. These are fundamental for being essential attributes of three doshas, namely, Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, forming the very basis of Ayurvedic constructs of health and disease. Ushna is the inherent property of Pitta, symbolizing fire both inside and outside the body. There are pathologies of Pitta where this Ushna property participates in pathogenesis to present the features like burning, sour eructation, and fever. In such cases, the course of treatment eventually focuses on reducing Pitta or reducing the Ushna property of Pitta, in particular. A similar cold association is found with Vata and Kapha, where the pathogenesis is reflected as heaviness, cold and cough, and edema. The treatment of Vata and Kapha diseases eventually focuses upon their reduction or reducing cold-related pathogenesis, in particular. This is evident that these two form an essential and integral component of Ayurvedic understanding of health and disease and are practically applied to make a diagnosis and define the treatment. In this chapter, we are expanding the details of Ushna and Sheeta constructs of Ayurvedic medicine and elaborating on their health and disease application.","According to Principle of Hot Ushna and Cold Sheeta and Its Clinical Application in Ayurvedic Medicine, the Ayurvedic treatment for pathologies of Pitta, which presents features like burning, sour eructation, and fever, focuses on reducing Pitta or specifically the Ushna hot property of Pitta. For diseases associated with Vata and Kapha, which manifest as heaviness, cold and cough, and edema, the treatment concentrates on reducing these doshas or specifically diminishing cold-related pathogenesis. These principles are fundamental to the Ayurvedic understanding of health and disease, and are applied practically in diagnosis and treatment."

The current review will summarize published works of literature on the effects of traditional Indian medicinal plants against acute respiratory infection COVID-19, SARS, Influenza, and Respiratory syncytial virus infection and registered clinical trials of traditional Indian herbal medicines in COVID-19. The current study aims to comprehensively evaluate the data of traditional Indian medicinal plants to warrant their use in COVID-19 management. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched along with different clinical trial databases. A total of 22 relevant traditional Indian medicinal plants 35 relevant studies were included in the current study having potential antiviral properties against virus-induced respiratory illness along with promising immunomodulatory and thrombolytic properties. Further, 36 randomized and nonrandomized registered clinical trials were also included that were aimed at evaluating the efficacy of herbal plants or their formulations in COVID-19 management. The antiviral, immunomodulatory, and thrombolytic activities of the traditional Indian medicinal plants laid down a strong rationale for their use in developing therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study identified some important potential traditional Indian medicinal herbs such as Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda, Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and Kabusura kudineer, which could be used in therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","According to Promising traditional Indian medicinal plants for the management of novel Coronavirus disease A systematic review, traditional Indian medicinal plants like Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda, Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and Kabusura kudineer have potential antiviral properties against virus-induced respiratory illness, including COVID-19.

Is Ephedra juice safe to consume and what are its potential health benefits,"Ephedra juice is used as the drink of longevity given even to the new born. This is an Aryan custom mentioned in Rigveda and followed even by the Romans. To trace the history of this custom would lead to identifying Soma Ephedra. The original species of Ephedra or Soma proper would be Ephedra sinica, the Chinese plant. It is the one species with yellow stalks. This has been illustrated so that it confirms Rigveda speaking of Soma as golden yellow. The name Soma is also a loan word from Chinese meaning fire-yellow fibers of hemp. The plant Soma is described as thousand boughs and photographic evidence has been offered in support. Each stalk is rod-like resembling an arrow as Rigveda speaks of it. An illustration has been offered to show the plant with stalks which are straight and rod-like, comparable with an arrow.","According to Soma of the Rigveda and an attempt to identify it, Ephedra juice is used as a longevity drink in Ayurvedic tradition, given even to newborns. The original species of this plant, referred to as Soma in the Rigveda, is likely Ephedra sinica, the Chinese plant with yellow stalks. The plant Soma, characterized by its thousand boughs and rod-like, arrow-resembling stalks, is believed to have health benefits which contribute to longevity."
What are some Ayurvedic treatments for Cholera,"The Sanskrit word Viscik refers to a condition in which vitiated vta da causes pain like pricking with a needle over the body. It occurs in a person suffering with ajrna indigestion and its detailed description is available in Ayurvedic literature. This disease has its existence in India since ancient times it has also been referred in Mahhrata and Tripitikas. Its etiology, signs, symptoms, complications, prognosis and treatment etc. as described in Ayurveda may be correlated with the disease Cholera, which is commonly known as Haiza in Hindi. In Greek language, the word Cholera means a flow of bile or the bilious disease. Cholera is an acute infectious diarrheal disease, caused by comma bacillus or vibrio cholerae sero groups 01 or 0139. Aretaetus, Benjamin Rush, Chadwick, John Snow, Robert Koch, etc. were some of the pioneers in Cholera research. Medico- historical importance of Cholera, its transmission, description and references from Ayurvedic texts etc., are being presented in this article.","According to Medico - historical study of Viscik Cholera, the Ayurvedic condition called Viscik, which causes body pain similar to pricking with a needle and occurs in individuals with indigestion ajrna, may be correlated with the disease Cholera.

What are some traditional Indian medicinal practices that could be beneficial for overall health,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Traditional Indian medicine is one of the oldest medical systems and remains popular worldwide. Traditional medicine systems in China and India have historical origins pertaining to mutual learning, reference, and development from medical theory to the drugs used. The exchange of traditional medicine between China and India began in the Qin and Han Dynasties 221 BC-220 AD, prospered in the Tang Dynasty 618-907 AD, and declined after the Song Dynasty 960-1279 AD. It was also directly related to the rise and fall of Buddhism. The traditional medicines of the two countries are highly complementary because of differences in geographical climate and the modernisation process of traditional medicine. AIM This review aimed to understand the spread and development of traditional Indian medicine in China to further promote exchange and cooperation between China and India in the field of traditional medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE via PubMed, CNKI, Science Direct, Sci-Hub, and other databases using the terms traditional Indian medicine or Indian medicine or Ayurveda or Yoga or Unani, and limiting the search to articles published between 1958 and 2019. We analysed the sources, publication date, type, and topic of the retrieved articlesstudies. RESULTS Based on the results of research on traditional Indian medicine carried out by Chinese scholars, 518 academic papers and 60 classic works published in China and abroad were collected. The results showed the following. First, Chinese scholars have systematically investigated traditional Indian medicine including its composition, management, and education the scale of medicinal and pharmaceutical plants protective measures of intellectual property rights of traditional medicine and international promotion of Yoga. Second, studies have examined the development status of traditional Indian medicine in China including the spread of Yoga in the country and the industrial scale of, education in, existing problems in, and clinical research on Yoga. In addition, Chinese scholars conducted research on and the translation of classic works and terms of Ayurveda, and studied the theory, treatment, and medicine thereof. Third, the historical exchange and trading status of traditional medicine between India and China have been discussed, including the exchange of traditional medicine between the two countries, effect of traditional Indian medicine on Chinese Buddhism, and minority medicine and trade in medicinal materials between the two countries. CONCLUSION India attaches great importance to the management of, education in, and industry of traditional medicine, and has made various efforts to protect intellectual property rights. Indian Yoga is very popular in China, and Chinese scholars have conducted some clinical research thereon. However, regulatory systems and legislation for Yoga are lacking in China. At present, traditional Chinese medicine scholars have an enhanced understanding of the term Yoga and less knowledge of the terms Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and similar concepts. We suggest that Chinese scholars further study the classic works, basic theories, treatment of clinical diseases, medicinal materials, and prescriptions compounding traditional Indian medicine. The results of this study highlight directions for Chinese scholars to pursue in further studying traditional Indian medicine comprehensively, and will help promote exchange and cooperation between China and India in the field of traditional medicine.","According to Traditional Indian medicine in China The status quo of recognition, development and research, traditional Indian medicine, including Ayurveda and Yoga, has been widely studied and applied in China.

What are some Ayurvedic remedies for managing high blood pressure or insomnia,"Ayurveda is the ancient before 2500 b.c. Indian system of health care and longevity. It involves a holistic view of man, his health, and illness. Ayurvedic treatment of a disease consists of salubrious use of drugs, diets, and certain practices. Medicinal preparations are invariably complex mixtures, based mostly on plant products. Around 1,250 plants are currently used in various Ayurvedic preparations. Many Indian medicinal plants have come under scientific scrutiny since the middle of the nineteenth century, although in a sporadic fashion. The first significant contribution from Ayurvedic materia medica came with the isolation of the hypertensive alkaloid from the sarpagandha plant Rouwolfia serpentina, valued in Ayurveda for the treatment of hypertension, insomnia, and insanity. This was the first important ancient-modern concordance in Ayurvedic plants. With the gradual coming of age of chemistry and biology, disciplines central to the study of biologic activities of natural products, many Ayurvedic plants have been reinvestigated. Our work on Commiphora wightti gum-resin, valued in Ayurveda for correcting lipid disorders, has been described in some detail based on these investigations, a modern antihyperlipoproteinemic drug is on the market in India and some other countries. There has also been concordance for a few other Ayurvedic crude drugs such as Asparagus racemosus, Cedrus deodara, and Psoralea corylifolia.","According to Ancient-modern concordance in Ayurvedic plants some examples, Ayurvedic treatment involves the use of drugs, diets, and practices, with medicinal preparations often being complex mixtures based mostly on plant products.

Is processed aconite safe to use in Ayurvedic treatments,"Crude aconite is an extremely lethal substance. However, the science of Ayurveda looks upon aconite as a therapeutic entity. Crude aconite is always processed i.e. it undergoes samskaras before being utilised in the Ayurvedic formulations. This study was undertaken in mice, to ascertain whether processed aconite is less toxic as compared to the crude or unprocessed one. It was seen that crude aconite was significantly toxic to mice 100 mortality at a dose of 2.6 mgmouse whereas the fully processed aconite was absolutely non-toxic no mortality at a dose even 8 times as high as that of crude aconite. Further, all the steps in the processing were essential for complete detoxification.","According to Can we dispense with Ayurvedic samskaras, crude aconite is extremely lethal, but when processed through Ayurvedic samskaras, it becomes a non-toxic therapeutic entity.

What are some common experiences of individuals who use Ayurveda in combination with other treatments,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda has its historical roots in India, but has also been internationalised, partly via migration and partly through an increased interest in alternative medicine in the West, where studies point toward increased use. However, there is to date scarce knowledge about the use and experiences of ayurveda in Sweden. METHODS We have conducted a case study of a center for ayurvedic healthcare in Sweden. We have collected information on client background data from the centers documentation, and compiled data from all clients who visited the centre for ayurvedic consultation during spring 2014. In total, 55 individuals were included in the study, and 18 of them were chosen for individual semi-structured interviews, to gain a deeper understanding of their motives for seeking, and experiences of ayurvedic health care. The material was analysed and compiled through a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS Among the 55 clients, 91 were female the mean age was 47 years, and 64 gave a specific illness as a reason for seeking ayurveda. The most common illnesses were respiratory, musculoskeletal, circulatory, tumor, and cutaneous illnesses. The qualitative results showed that ayurveda was being used in combination with other methods, including various diets, other alternative medicine methods and conventional medicine. Some participants recounted having sought ayurveda as a complement to conventional medicine, or in cases when conventional medicine had been experienced as insufficient in terms of diagnosis or treatment. However, some participants experienced it as difficult to follow the ayurvedic life-style advice in the midst of their everyday life. Many participants reported positive experiences of pulse diagnostics, which was the main diagnostic method used in ayurvedic consultation. Some reported concrete, physical improvement of their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This study points towards important aspects of participant experience of ayurveda, that may be subject to further research. The positive effects experienced by some clients should be studied more systematically in order to discern whether they are specific or non-specific. In addition, interesting knowledge may be gained through further study of the reported positive experiences of pulse diagnosis.","According to The use of ayurvedic medicine in the context of health promotion--a mixed methods case study of an ayurvedic centre in Sweden, Ayurvedic medicine is commonly used in combination with other methods such as various diets, other alternative medicine methods, and conventional medicine.

Is it safe to consume Ayurvedic medicines considering they might contain natural radionuclides,"Purpose Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicines in the world being practiced widely in the Indian subcontinent for more than 3000 years, and still remains as one of the important traditional health care systems. The Ayurvedic drugs are derived primarily from various parts of the plants, like root, leaf, flower, fruit or plant as a whole. Plants uptake minerals and other nutrients from the soil through their root system. Along with other minerals radionuclides present in the growing media also reach to the plant parts following the same pathway. Realizing the probable health hazards via the intake of Ayurvedic drugs, it is important to assess the concentration of natural radionuclides in commonly used medicinal plants.Materials and methods NaITl scintillator-based gamma-ray spectrometry has been used to determine the activity concentrations of primordial radionuclides 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in the most commonly used medicinal plant parts as ingredients of Ayurvedic medicines in India.Results and discussion The average specific activity Bqkg-1 of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K was found to be 43 18, 36 15Formula see text and 230 46, respectively. The estimated annual committed effective doses due to the intake of common Ayurvedic medicines at prescribed dosage was found to be 39 16 Sv y-1,Formula see text which is quite low as compared with the radiation dose limit of 1 mSvy-1 from all natural sources, reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP-60.Conclusions It is found categorically that intake of Ayurvedic medicines at normal dosage poses no radiological hazard to the individual. Present results are significant in the wake of myths that many hazardous materials including radioisotopes are present at higher levels. Obtained results also serve as a reference information for the distribution of radionuclides in medicinal plant species.","According to Radionuclide concentrations in medicinal florae and committed effective dose through Ayurvedic medicines, the intake of Ayurvedic medicines, which are primarily derived from various parts of plants, at normal dosage poses no radiological hazard to the individual. The average specific activity of primordial radionuclides 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K in commonly used medicinal plant parts is quite low, and the estimated annual committed effective doses due to the intake of common Ayurvedic medicines at prescribed dosage was found to be significantly lower than the radiation dose limit from all natural sources reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

Are there any potential side effects of using traditional Indian medical treatments for neck and back pain,"INTRODUCTION Low back and neck pain are common musculoskeletal disorders with multiple treatment options. Indias traditional medical systems, known as Ayush Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy offer range of interventions and are widely used. In view of limited documentation of adverse events following Ayush interventions for lumbar and cervical spondylosis, we synthesized evidence and estimated proportion of studies reporting adverse events. METHODS We systematically searched all published documents from biomedical and multidisciplinary abstract and citation databases and Ayush-specific repositories from their inception to April 2021. We selected studies as per inclusion criteria and extracted information, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We systematically reviewed the qualitative evidence form the selected studies. RESULTS Majority 94 of the selected 113 studies were interventional studies and included 77 68.1 journal articles and 35 31 academic dissertations. Among the Ayush systems, considerable proportion was from Ayurveda 32.7, followed by Siddha 24.8, Yoga 22.1, Unani 15.9 and Homoeopathy 4.4. Almost three-fourths of the studies were on lumbar spondylosis 65 n 74, followed by cervical spondylosis 31 n 35, and the remaining four included both. Thirteen percent of the 113 studies described adverse events Yoga 9.7 Unani 1.8 and Homoeopathy 1.8. More adverse events were reported among the studies on lumbar 9.7 than cervical spondylosis 2.7. The nature of interventions were non-pharmacological 10.6 n 12, pharmacological n 2 1.8 or combined n 1 0.9. CONCLUSIONS Only one in eight studies reported any adverse event following Ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis.

What are some traditional herbal remedies used in far-west Nepal for common illnesses,"BACKGROUND Plant species have long been used as principal ingredients of traditional medicine in far-west Nepal. The medicinal plants with ethnomedicinal values are currently being screened for their therapeutic potential but their data and information are inadequately compared and analyzed with the Ayurveda and the phytochemical findings. METHODS The present study evaluated ethnomedicinal plants and their uses following literature review, comparison, field observations, and analysis. Comparison was made against earlier standard literature of medicinal plants and ethnomedicine of the same area, the common uses of the Ayurveda and the latest common phytochemical findings. The field study for primary data collection was carried out from 2006-2008. RESULTS The herbal medicine in far-west Nepal is the basis of treatment of most illness through traditional knowledge. The medicine is made available via ancient, natural health care practices such as tribal lore, home herbal remedy, and the Baidhya, Ayurveda and Amchi systems. The traditional herbal medicine has not only survived but also thrived in the trans-cultural environment with its intermixture of ethnic traditions and beliefs. The present assessment showed that traditional herbal medicine has flourished in rural areas where modern medicine is parsimoniously accessed because of the high cost and long travel time to health center. Of the 48 Nepalese medicinal plants assessed in the present communication, about half of the species showed affinity with the common uses of the Ayurveda, earlier studies and the latest phytochemical findings. The folk uses of Acacia catechu for cold and cough, Aconitum spicatum as an analgesic, Aesculus indica for joint pain, Andrographis paniculata for fever, Anisomeles indica for urinary affections, Azadirachta indica for fever, Euphorbia hirta for asthma, Taxus wallichiana for tumor control, and Tinospora sinensis for diabetes are consistent with the latest pharmacological findings, common Ayurvedic and earlier uses. CONCLUSIONS Although traditional herbal medicine is only a primary means of health care in far-west Nepal, the medicine has been pursued indigenously with complementing pharmacology and the Ayurveda. Therefore, further pharmacological evaluation of traditional herbal medicine deserves more attention.","According to Traditional herbal medicine in far-west Nepal a pharmacological appraisal, traditional herbal medicine is a primary means of healthcare in far-west Nepal.

How has the history of Ayurveda influenced its current practices and treatments,"Ayurveda traces its origins to contributions of mythological and real physicians that lived millennia earlier. In many respects, Western medicine also had similar origins and beliefs, however, the introduction of anatomical dissection and progressive application of scientific evidence based practices have resulted in divergent paths taken by these systems. We examined the lives, careers, and contributions made by nine ancient Indian physicians. Ancient texts, translations of these texts, books, and biographical works were consulted to obtain relevant information, both for Indian traditional medicine as well as for Western medicine. Ayurveda has retained principles enunciated by these physicians, with minor conceptual advances over the centuries. Western medicine separated from ancient Indian medicine several hundred years ago, and remains the foundation of modern medicine. Modern medicine is evidence based, and randomized clinical trials RCTs are the gold standard by which efficacy of treatment is evaluated. Ayurvedic medicine has not undergone such critical evaluation to any large extent. The few RCTs that have evaluated alternative medical treatment recently have shown that such therapy is no better than placebo however, placebo treatment is 30 effective. We suggest that foreign domination, initially by Mughals, and later by the British, may have contributed, in part, to this inertia and protracted status quo.","According to research, The paper Contributions of ancient Indian physicians--implications for modern times does not provide specific Ayurvedic remedies. However, it does state that Ayurvedic medicine has retained principles enunciated by ancient Indian physicians with minor conceptual advances over centuries. It also mentions the need for more randomized clinical trials to critically evaluate Ayurvedic treatments."

What are some historical beliefs about the health benefits of semen conservation,"The ancient doctrine of semen conservation has a long philosophical history in Europe and Asia. In Sanskrit, semen is equated with sukra, the life force. As early as 600 B.C., the Caraka Samhita taught the importance of sukra, and gave prescriptions to augment it. In the 18th century, semen conservation theory reentered Western medicine through Tissots Treatise on the Diseases Produced by Onanism. It became the basis of the degeneracy theory of all disease, and of the masturbation hysteria of the 19th and 20th centuries.","According to Semen-conservation doctrine from ancient Ayurvedic to modern sexological theory, the ancient Ayurvedic text, the Caraka Samhita, emphasized the importance of sukra or semen, which is equated with the life force, and provided prescriptions to enhance it. However, the specific Ayurvedic remedies for this purpose are not detailed in the abstract."

What is the Ayurvedic approach to treating Vitiligo or skin diseases like Kilsa,The earliest known reference to Kilsa was in 2200 B.C. in the period of Aushooryan. In 1550 B.C. information regarding Vitiligo was noted in the Ebers Papyrus. Atharvavda also carries the description of the disease Kilsa along with several herbal prescriptions. Buddhist literature Ptiks especially Vinaya Ptika carries the description of Kilsa. Old Testament also carries the description of white spots i.e. in the Leviticus chapter 13. In ayurvda the word Kua was used for all types of skin diseases. Both Kilsa and Switra are mentioned together in ayurvda because of similarity in their aetiology. Kilsa is also called as Bhya external Kua. It is classified into three types based on three Ds. Prognosis of the disease was also described in ayurvda. This disease can be compared with Vitiligoleucoderma in modern medicine. The Roman Physician Celsus first coined the term Vitiligo in the 2nd Century A.D. This article carries medico-historical references of Kilsa from ancient to modern literature.,"According to Medico-historical study of Kilasa vitiligoleucoderma a common skin disorder, the disease Kilsa, which can be compared to Vitiligo or leucoderma in modern medicine, is discussed in Ayurveda. The term was used for all types of skin diseases and is often mentioned alongside Switra due to their similar aetiology. Kilsa is also referred to as Bhya external Kua and is classified into three types based on the three Ds. The prognosis of the disease was also described in Ayurveda. Additionally, Ayurveda provides several herbal prescriptions to treat Kilsa."
What are some marine resources used in Ayurvedic medicines,"Natural resources such as plants, animals and minerals have always been used by mankind to develop drugs and marine world is no exception. Marine by-products like conches, pearls, mother of pearl shells, corals and so forth have been used by traditional Ayurvedic practitioners for centuries. The unique methods of these preparations are scientifically designed to eliminate unwanted impurities and convert them into bioavailable form. In this study, Conch Xanchus pyrum was used as a marine resource of calcium carbonate and was converted pharmaceutically from its aragonite form to calcite. All the steps of preparations and changes in the properties therein were documented and validated. Further, traditional as well as modern analytical tools were used to study its physical and chemical characters to develop a monograph. The physical characterization included particle size, X-ray diffraction XRD, Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM, Thermogravimetric Analysis TGA and Fourier Transform Infra-red FTIR. Metal composition and heavy metal limits were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry ICPOES. This study revealed the rearrangement of aragonite crystals into calcite form by grinding, trituration with aloe vera juice and incineration under controlled conditions. Moreover, the finished product was found to be devoid of organic matrix that is nacre. This study creates a foundation for the development of a master formula for commonly used Shankha Bhasma in Ayurvedic medicines.","According to Pharmaceutical Standardization and Physicochemical Characterization of Traditional Ayurvedic Marine Drug Incinerated Conch Shell Shankha Bhasma, the Ayurvedic remedy involves the use of a Conch Xanchus pyrum as a marine resource of calcium carbonate.

Are there any harmful substances in over-the-counter Ayurvedic health supplements,"OBJECTIVES Ayurvedic formulations are becoming the prior choice of people as health care supplements. The increasing demand for these formulations has led to extensive development of Ayurvedic pharmaceutical industries worldwide. The reaction between the preservatives sodium benzoates and ascorbic acid used in these formulations could generate benzene. Benzene is classified as class-1 human carcinogen and responsible for various short and long term health effects. METHODS In this study, 25 formulations containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate of various manufacturers available as over the counter products were obtained and their benzene content were determined using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. RESULTS The result showed that 64 of the formulations were free from benzene contamination whereas 36 of formulations were found to be contaminated with benzene. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and validated gas chromatographic method for estimation of benzene in Ayurvedic formulations was also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSIONS The data revealed that the level of benzene was within permissible limits, yet the presence of a carcinogen in the marketed formulations intended for internal use is an alarming situation.","According to Ayurvedic formulations containing benzoic and ascorbic acids as additives benzene formation during storage and impact of additives on quality parameters, Ayurvedic formulations containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate may generate benzene, a class-1 human carcinogen.

Can the taste of a medicinal plant predict its health benefits according to Ayurveda,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Understanding the patterns that shape traditional medical knowledge is essential for accelerating ethnopharmacological progress. According to Ayurveda, medicinal plants that belong to different taxa, but which have similar taste, may display similar ethnopharmacological activities EPAs Bhishagratna, 1998 Sharma and Dash, 2006. AIM OF THE STUDY To understand the patterns that govern the distribution of herbal EPAs in Ayurveda and to evaluate the potential concordance between chemical class or taste of the constituent phytocompounds and EPAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS A mixed database PhytoMolecularTasteDB was constructed for Ayurvedic medicinal plants by integrating modern data medicinal plant composition, phytochemical taste with traditional data ethnopharmacological activities of plant. PhytoMolecularTasteDB contains 431 Ayurvedic medicinal plants, 94 EPAs, 223 chemical classes of phytocompounds and 438 herbal tastants. Potential global or individual associations between chemical classestaste of the phytoconstituents and EPAs were statistically analyzed. RESULTS There was no global statistical correlation between the various chemical classes of phytocompounds and EPAs, although there were several individual correlations. The results suggest the existence of a global statistical correlation besides several individual correlations between the plant molecular taste various taste-based classes of phytocompounds and EPAs. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that phytochemical taste may be more relevant than chemical class for EPAs prediction.","According to Taste of phytocompounds A better predictor for ethnopharmacological activities of medicinal plants than the phytochemical class, Ayurvedic medicinal plants that have similar taste may display similar ethnopharmacological activities. The study suggests the existence of a global statistical correlation between the plant molecular taste various taste-based classes of phytocompounds and ethnopharmacological activities. Hence, the taste of phytocompounds may be a more relevant predictor for ethnopharmacological activities of medicinal plants than their phytochemical class."
What can traditional tribal medicine offer for common health issues in Meghalaya,"BACKGROUND National policy on medical pluralism in India encourages the mainstreaming of AYUSH Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems and the revitalization of local health traditions LHT. In Meghalaya state in the northeast, the main LHT is its indigenous tribal traditional medicine. This paper presents the perceptions of tribal medicine and of AYUSH systems among various policy actors and locates the tribal medicine of Meghalaya within the policy on medical pluralism currently being implemented in the state, a region that is ethnically and culturally different and predominantly inhabited by indigenous peoples. METHODS A stakeholder mapping exercise identified appropriate policy actors and 46 in-depth interviews were conducted with policy makers, doctors, academics, members of healer associations and elders of the community. A further 44 interviews were conducted with 24 Khasi and 20 Garo traditional healers. Interview data were supplemented with document analysis and observations. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis that incorporated elements of grounded theory. RESULTS In Meghalaya there is high awareness and utilization of tribal medicine, but no visible efforts by the public sector to support or engage with healers. The AYUSH systems in contrast had little local acceptance but promotion of these systems has led to a substantial increase in AYUSH doctors, particularly homeopaths, in rural areas. Policy actors outside the health department saw an important role for tribal medicine due to its popularity, local belief in its efficacy and its cultural resonance. The need to engage with healers to enhance referral, training, documentation and research of tribal medicine was made. CONCLUSIONS The wide acceptance of tribal medicine suggests that tribal medicine needs to be supported. The results of the study question the process of the implementation of the mainstreaming AYUSH policy for Meghalaya and highlight the importance of contextualizing health policy within the local culture. A potential role for Health Policy and Systems Research HPSR at sub-national levels is also highlighted.","According to Is mainstreaming AYUSH the right policy for Meghalaya, northeast India, the tribal medicine of Meghalaya, a local health tradition, is highly accepted and utilized by the local community.

The study suggests that due to its popularity, belief in its efficacy, and cultural resonance, tribal medicine should be supported. The need for engagement with healers to improve referral, training, documentation, and research of tribal medicine was also"
What precautions should I take to avoid heavy metal toxicity when using traditional Indian medicine,"Introduction Ayurveda and Siddha are two important components of the traditional Indian medicine TIM. The regulatory mechanisms have been insufficient, and heavy metal toxicity with TIM preparations continues to be a public health nuisance, putting integrated medicine practice in jeopardy. The current study was undertaken to review the potential health hazards of the heavy metal content in the TIM and formulate patient-safety recommendations for integrative medical practice. Materials and Methods Systematic MEDLINE searches were performed using a combination of relevant MeSH terms and keywords, and case reportseries of Ayurveda or Siddha-induced heavy metal toxicity, published in the previous two decades, were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the tool by Murad et al. Results A total of 220 cases 51 case reports and 14 case series were found lead, n 156 arsenic, n 11 mercury, n 47 thallium, n 1 gold, n 1 combination of heavy metals, n 4 after screening for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 169 76.8 had a low risk of bias, 113 out of 135 83.7 analyzed contained higher-than-permissible heavy metal content in the drug samples, and the majority showed elevated biological levels of the heavy metals in the body. Conclusion The heavy metals in TIM are often the result of adulteration or improper manufacturing and prescribing practices, despite national and international guidelines recommending quality standards and protocols for preparing and dispensing TIM. We thus propose multipronged approaches and provide recommendations at various levels, including individual, institutional, national policy decisions essential to establish patient safety of TIM.","According to Heavy Metals in Indian Traditional Systems of Medicine A Systematic Scoping Review and Recommendations for Integrative Medicine Practice, there are potential health hazards associated with heavy metal content in traditional Indian medicine, including Ayurveda and Siddha.

What should I do if I experience a severe skin reaction after taking a new medication,"Toxic epidermolysis necrosis TEN or Lyell syndrome is a potentially life-threatening immunological adverse skin disease, which mostly occurs secondary to the intake of an offending drug. It commonly manifests as a widespread exfoliating bullous lesion in skin and mucous membrane mimicking superficial burns and may result in hypovolemic andor septic shock. Authors report an unusual case of Lyells syndrome in a 42-year-old woman, secondary to the intake of Ayurveda medicine Vajra Bhasma Diamond Ash prescribed by an Ayurveda physician for treatment of her trigeminal neuralgia. After 8th day of continuous medication intake, she had prodromal illness and rapidly developing exfoliative skin lesion extended over 80 of total body surface area, breathing difficulty, dizziness and anuria. The case was successfully managed by timely diagnosis, adequate hydration and administration of immunoglobulins. After 17 days, the skin epithelium regenerated, and she improved clinically with some depigmented lesions at discharge, which were normalised without any sequel during her further follow-up visits in hospital. Identification and withdrawal of the suspected drug, adequate resuscitation and early immunoglobulin administration are critical in management of TEN.","According to Vajra Bhasma, Ayurvedic medicine a rare and unusual cause of Lyells syndrome and its successful management, the Ayurvedic medicine Vajra Bhasma Diamond Ash can potentially lead to Lyells syndrome or Toxic epidermolysis necrosis TEN.

Can Ayurvedic treatments from ancient manuscripts be effective for modern diseases like cancer or tuberculosis,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Ancient India relied on manuscripts written by scholars for storing, transferring and retrieving the information pertaining to culture, traditions, religion, geography and political issues. Similarly, Ayurveda, an ancient human health care management system in India and most of its information is available through palm-leaf manuscripts. Though each palm-leaf can persist for a fairly long time, it suffers gradual deterioration owing to physical, chemincal and biological factors, thus warranting digitiation. The palm-leaf manuscripts of Ayurveda are extensively studied for finding new drug or treatment methods to new-age diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY The present study concerns an unpublished ancient Telugu palm-leaf manuscript containing Ayurvedic medicine information enscripted on 33 palm-leaves. Since the palm-leaf manuscript is very old, the manual documentation, translation, digitization and analysis of it may shed light on hidden ayurvedic information that may be useful to the modern society. MATERIALS AND METHODS The palm-leaf manuscript with 33 folios were manually documented and digitized into a Telugu book followed by translation into English. The scientific names of historical diseases, plants, animals, metals and minerals were identified based on published sources. RESULTS A critical scrutiny of the palm-leaf manuscript revealed 120 formulations with 164 plants for 29 different kinds of diseases such as meha and prameha urinary problems, eye diseases, skin diseases, respiratory diseases, fevers, digestive disorders, jaundice, tuberculosis, cancer and so on. Plant and animal products, metals and minerals mentioned in the said formulations were identified and listed. CONCLUSION Basing on our study, it is concluded that the said manuscript contains mono-or poly-herbo-mineral formulations for the treatment of various ailments.This information can be incorporated into and compared with available data bases to find out the effectiveness of the drug or formulation for any given diseases. Further validation of the formulations can be done by phytochemical and in vivo pharmacological assays.","According to Enumeration of various Ayurvedic formulations listed in an ancient palm-leaf manuscript of Rayalaseema region in Andhra Pradesh state, India, an ancient manuscript revealed 120 formulations involving 164 plants that were used to treat 29 different kinds of diseases.

Who were the first known practitioners of surgery in ancient times,"Surgery and Medicine are inseparably fused today as essential parts of the art of heeling. Over the millennia of recorded history, Medicine and Surgery have followed separate and largely independent evolutionary pertains. It is obvious that medical care could not have been complete without some surgery in ancient times. This branch of medical skill was not accepted as profession. The practitioners were members of all low caste, who were illiterates and passed on their knowledge by oral tradition rather than in writing. The barbers are celebrity surgeons in ancient India and continued till the recent past it is evident by Pandyan inscriptions of Tamilnadu of 7th-8th centuries A.D.

What are some historical methods for treating wounds that are still used today,"The response of living tissues to injury forms the foundation of all surgical practices. Indeed, from the historical point of view, tissue injury or Vrana or wound and its sequelae have participated in cure of most of the general medical problems from the days of Susruta till date. The earlier medical literatures extensively considered wound care as based on instinctive remedies but on the other hand, the present concepts cogitate healing of wound based on visual observations. Basic perception of wound healing only in its interpretation, which has varied from civilization to civilization. There are various methods for treating of wounds and have since been passed over by ancient humans to todays modern surgeons. Therefore, it is very essential to know the historical aspects of Vrana and its Ropana since the beginning of the tear of medicine as compare to wound and its healing from the modern point of view.

How can Ayurvedic psychiatry help in dealing with mental health issues,"In this paper, the author traces two parallel movements of institutionalized Ayurvedic psychiatry, an emergent field of specialization in Kerala, India the work of purification and the work of translation that Latour has described as characteristic of the modern constitution. The author delineates these processes in terms of the relationship of Ayurvedic psychiatry to 1 allopathic psychiatry, 2 bhutavidya, a branch of textual Ayurveda dealing with spirits, and 3 occult violence. The aim is to offer a model of these open and hidden processes and of Ayurvedic psychiatrys positioning within a hierarchical mental health field characterized simultaneously by biopsychiatric hegemony and a persistent vernacular healing tradition. Through these processes, Ayurvedic psychiatry emerges as a relevant actor. It demarcates itself from both allopathic and vernacular epistemologies and ontologies while simultaneously drawing upon aspects of each, and, in this way, shows itself to be both deeply modern and highly pragmatic.","According to Translation and purification Ayurvedic psychiatry, allopathic psychiatry, spirits and occult violence in Kerala, South India, Ayurvedic psychiatry is an emerging field in Kerala, India that positions itself uniquely within the mental health field. It differentiates itself from allopathic psychiatry and vernacular healing traditions, yet it also integrates aspects from both. This approach makes Ayurvedic psychiatry a modern and pragmatic method in the institutionalized Ayurvedic field."
How reliable is an Ayurvedic diagnosis for knee osteoarthritis,"Background Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine. The customized Ayurvedic approach consists of a combination of several diagnostic procedures and subsequent individualized therapeutic interventions. Evaluation of inter-rater reliability IRR of Ayurvedic diagnoses has rarely been performed. The aim of this study was to evaluate IRR of Ayurvedic diagnosis for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods A diagnostic reliability study of 30 patients and 4 Ayurvedic experts was nested in a randomized controlled trial. Patients were diagnosed in a sequential order by all experts utilizing a semistructured patient history form. A nominal group technique as consensus procedure was performed to reach agreement on the items to be diagnosed. An IRR analysis using Fleiss and Cohens kappa statistics was performed to determine a chance-corrected measure of agreement among raters. Results One hundred and twenty different ratings and 30 consensus ratings were performed and analyzed. While high percentages of agreement for main diagnostic entities and the final Ayurveda diagnosis 95 consensus agreement on main diagnosis could be observed, this was not reflected in the corresponding kappa values, which largely yielded fair-to-poor inter-rater agreement kappas for central diagnostic aspects such as prakriti and agni values between 0 and 0.4. Notably, agreement on disease-related entities was better than that on constitutional entities. Conclusions This is the first diagnostic study embedded in a clinical trial on patients with knee osteoarthritis utilizing a multimodality whole systems approach. Results showed a contrast between the high agreement of the consented final diagnosis and disagreement on certain diagnostic details. Future diagnostic studies should have larger sample sizes and a methodology more tailored to the specificities of traditional whole systems of medicine. Equal emphasis will need to be placed on all core diagnostic components of Ayurveda, both constitutional and disease specific, using detailed structured history taking forms.","According to Reliability of Ayurvedic Diagnosis for Knee Osteoarthritis Patients A Nested Diagnostic Study Within a Randomized Controlled Trial, the Ayurvedic approach to diagnosing knee osteoarthritis involves a combination of several diagnostic procedures and individualized therapeutic interventions.

Can Ayurvedic principles help in understanding and treating different types of psychosis,"OBJECTIVE This is a preliminary report on the development of a scale to measure the symptoms of unmda psychosis attributable to tridosa metabolic principles by using the concepts of Ayurvedic medicine. DESIGN The 67-item unmda specific symptom scale was developed on the basis of translation of Sanskrit verses describing vtaja V, pittaja P, and kaphaja K unmda specific symptoms of psychosis due to the imbalances of metabolic components and by taking the opinions of experts 15 Ayurveda experts, 5 psychiatrists, and 5 psychologists. SETTINGS The setting for this study was Spandana Psychiatric Nursing Home Bangalore, India. SUBJECTS The scale was administered by an unblinded assessor to 30 consecutive patients with nonaffective psychotic disorders. RESULTS The unmda specific symptom scale was associated with excellent internal consistency. The Cronbachs alpha for V, P, and K scales were 0.98, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The split-half reliability for V, P, and K scales were 0.97, 0.97, and 0.88 respectively. Scores on vtaja, pittaja, and kaphaja scales were inversely correlated, suggesting that they are mutually exclusive. The three subgroups of psychoses--paranoid schizophrenia, schizophrenia unspecified, and unspecified nonorganic psychosis--had significantly different loadings on the three scores, having high scores on vtaja, pittaja, and kaphaja, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The tridoshas in psychotic disorders can be measured reliably by this instrument. The scores on each of these doas help in differentiating three types of psychosis according to Ayurveda that have good correspondence with prevailing classification. However, this scale must also be applied to the other 28 separate subcategories of the psychoses that are identified in the International Statistical Classifications of Diseases version 10 and to the 10 variants of psychosis as defined by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-R to help better understand the true utility for use here with the various subcategories of schizophrenia.","According to Measuring the tridosha symptoms of unmda psychosis a preliminary study, a 67-item scale was developed to measure the symptoms of unmda psychosis attributable to tridosa metabolic principles using Ayurvedic medicine concepts.

What are some ancient practices for managing obesity and diabetes through exercise,"When considering the history of exercise physiology, authors begin with Hippocrates and the Golden Age of Greece before mentioning Galen and the contributions from Rome. However, this approach has omitted the information from the ancient civilizations of India which flourished before and during the emergence of Mycenaen cultures. Specifically ignored have been 1 the tridosa doctrine humoral theory, which as early as 1500 B.C., emphasized that disease occurred because of a displacement of one or more of the three humors, with health being achieved when the humors were in equilibrium and 2 the perspective of Susruta Sushruta who was a 600 B.C. physician who included exercise in his prescriptions to prevent and treat diseases. Susruta not only advocated exercise to maintain equilibrium among the humors, notably kapha, he promoted exercise to minimize the consequences of obesity and diabetes. To be effective, exercise had to be daily and moderate in intensity and never excessive or to exceed the half-maximum limit for exhaustion, because disease or even death could ensue. It is concluded that Susrutas concepts pertaining to chronic exercise and to the health benefits of exercise were remarkably modern and that future authors on the history of exercise physiology should include contributions from ancient India.","According to Susruta of India, an unrecognized contributor to the history of exercise physiology, the ancient Indian physician Susruta used exercise as a medicinal tool. He advocated for daily, moderate intensity exercise, not exceeding half-maximum limit for exhaustion, as a way to maintain equilibrium among the three humors, particularly kapha. Susruta also promoted exercise as a method to minimize the consequences of obesity and diabetes. His beliefs about chronic exercise and its health benefits are viewed as modern and noteworthy."
What are some medicinal plants mentioned in the Vmana Purna for treating health issues,"Purna and Itihsa history have been the allied subjects since the early Vdik times. They have been regarded as supplementary to each other. The word Purna as an adjective means ancient or old.

What are some traditional Ayurvedic remedies for nervous diseases,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Food is medicine and vice versa. In Hindu and Ayurvedic medicine, and among human cultures of the Indian subcontinent in general, the perception of the food-medicine continuum is especially well established. The preparation of the exhilarating, gold-coloured Soma, Amrita or Ambrosia, the elixir and food of the immortals-the Hindu pantheon-by the ancient Indo-Aryans, is described in the Rigveda in poetic hymns. Different theories regarding the botanical identity of Soma circulate, but no pharmacologically and historically convincing theory exists to date. We intend to contribute to the botanical, chemical and pharmacological characterisation of Soma through an analysis of two historical Amrita recipes recorded in the Bower Manuscript. The recipes are referred therein as panaceas clarified butter and also as a medicine to treat nervous diseases oil, while no exhilarating properties are mentioned. Notwithstanding this, we hypothesise, that these recipes are related to the ca. 1800 years older Rigvedic Soma. We suppose that the psychoactive Soma ingredients are among the components, possibly in smaller proportions, of the Amrita recipes preserved in the Bower Manuscript. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Bower Manuscript is a medical treatise recorded in the 6th century A.D. in Sanskrit on birch bark leaves, probably by Buddhist monks, and unearthed towards the end of the 19th century in Chinese Turkestan. We analysed two Amrita recipes from the Bower Manuscript, which was translated by Rudolf Hoernle into English during the early 20th century. A database search with the updated Latin binomials of the herbal ingredients was used to gather quantitative phytochemical and pharmacological information. RESULTS Together, both Amrita recipes contain around 100 herbal ingredients. Psychoactive alkaloid containing species still important in Ayurvedic, Chinese and Thai medicine and mentioned in the recipe for Amrita-Prsa clarified butter and Amrita Oil are Tinospora cordifolia Amrita, Guduchi, three Sida spp., Mucuna pruriens, Nelumbo nucifera, Desmodium gangeticum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata. These species contain several notorious and potential psychoactive and psychedelic alkaloids, namely tryptamines, 2-phenylethylamine, ephedrine, aporphines, ibogaine, and L-DOPA. Furthermore, protoberberine alkaloids, tetrahydro--carbolines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines with monoamine oxidase inhibitor MAO-I activity but also neurotoxic properties are reported. CONCLUSIONS We propose that Soma was a combination of a protoberberine alkaloids containing Tinospora cordifolia juice with MAO-I properties mixed together with a tryptamine rich Desmodium gangeticum extract or a blending of Tinospora cordifolia with an ephedrine and phenylethylamine-rich Sida spp. extract. Tinospora cordifolia combined with Desmodium gangeticum might provide a psychedelic experience with visual effects, while a combination of Tinospora cordifolia with Sida spp. might lead to more euphoric and amphetamine-like experiences.","According to Soma, food of the immortals according to the Bower Manuscript Kashmir, 6th century A.D., the Ayurvedic remedy Amrita, which is described in the Bower Manuscript, contains around 100 herbal ingredients.

Methods A two fold search strategy was adopted to obtain the literature search through PUBMED and hand search through cross references. Of the 58 articles obtained through both the search approaches 13 articles were finally included in the review. Results The studies reviewed assessed the utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. Utilization was observed in a particular geographical area states and by a specific group of people such as tribal and general population, medical practitioners and religious groups. Perception about AYUSH system was mixed with different segments of the society. Preference among the general population revolved around distrust or frustration with allopathic medicine, cost effectiveness, accessibility, non-availability of other options and less side effects of AYUSH medicines. Moreover people primarily adopted AYUSH systems of medicine based on their personal experiences and recommended the same to other people as well. Conclusions A mixed response was observed through this systematic review with regard to utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. A higher level of awareness and governmental patronization is required to make it available to the common man at the last corner of the society for the benefit of the former and the system as well.","According to Utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India a systematic review, the AYUSH system of medicine is preferred and used by a specific group of people, particularly in certain geographical areas in India. This preference is often due to reasons such as distrust or frustration with allopathic medicine, cost effectiveness, accessibility, non-availability of other options and less side effects of AYUSH medicines. Personal experiences often influence the adoption of AYUSH remedies, and individuals often recommend the same to others. However, a higher level of awareness and government support is needed to make it widely available."
What are some of the reasons why people in India dont use traditional medical systems like AYUSH,"For the first time, we have a comprehensive database on usage of AYUSH acronym for Ayurveda, naturopathy and Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy in India at the household level. This article aims at exploring the spread of the traditional medical systems in India and the perceptions of people on the access and effectiveness of these medical systems using this database. The article uses the unit level data purchased from the National Sample Survey Organization, New Delhi. Household is the basic unit of survey and the data are the collective opinion of the household. This survey shows that less than 30 of Indian households use the traditional medical systems. There is also a regional pattern in the usage of particular type of traditional medicine, reflecting the regional aspects of the development of such medical systems. The strong faith in AYUSH is the main reason for its usage lack of need for AYUSH and lack of awareness about AYUSH are the main reasons for not using it. With regard to source of medicines in the traditional medical systems, home is the main source in the Indian medical system and private sector is the main source in Homeopathy. This shows that there is need for creating awareness and improving access to traditional medical systems in India. By and large, the users of AYUSH are also convinced about the effectiveness of these traditional medicines.","According to the research paper Spread of Traditional Medicines in India Results of National Sample Survey Organizations Perception Survey on Use of AYUSH, less than 30 of Indian households use the traditional medical systems under the AYUSH umbrella, which includes Ayurveda, naturopathy, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The usage varies regionally, reflecting regional development of these medical systems. The primary reason for using AYUSH is strong faith in its effectiveness, while lack of awareness and perceived lack of need are the main reasons for not using it. The main source of medicines in the Indian traditional medical systems is home, while for Homeopathy, it is the private sector. The paper suggests a need"
How has the state influenced the development and practice of Ayurveda and Yunani medicine in India,"This is a study of the emergence of new institutional arenas for ayurveda and yunani medicine, collectivized at the time as indigenous medicine, in a semi-autonomous State Mysore in late colonial India. The study argues that the characteristic dimensions of this process were compromise and misalignment between ideals of governance and modes of pedagogy and practice. Running counter to a narrative that the Princely States such as Mysore were instrumental for the preservation of ayurveda, this study analyzes the process of negotiation and struggle between a variety of actors engaged with shaping the direction of institutionalized indigenous medicine. In examining the entanglements over the priorities of the state administration and the conflicting desires and ideals of protagonists, the study problematizes the idea of studying the encounter between the state and indigenous medicine, in order rather to highlight their co-production and the tensions which were generated in the process. While institution-making for ayurveda and yunani in Mysore State assumed distinctive translocal forms, themes of divergence that were unresolved during the time of this study, over the role of the state, the politics of validation, appropriate curricula and pedagogy, and their relation to practice and employment, continue to inform the trajectories of state-directed health provision through indigenous medicine on larger scales India, health-care, ayurveda, yunani, education.","According to research, The research paper does not provide specific information on ayurvedic remedies. However, it discusses the institutionalization and teaching practices of Ayurveda and Yunani medicine in Mysore State, India during late colonial period. The research examines the negotiation and struggles between various actors shaping the direction of indigenous medicine. Key issues included the role of the state, politics of validation, appropriate curricula and pedagogy, and their relation to practice and employment. All these continue to influence the trajectories of state-directed health provision through indigenous medicine on larger scales according to Compromised making institutions and indigenous medicine in Mysore State, circa 1908-1940."

"Can Ayurvedic herbometallic medicines, or bhasmas, provide any health benefits","The validity of herbometallic bhasmas described in Ayurveda is nowhere acknowledged by biomedical science. To unravel the knowledge of bhasmas, an algorithm integrating ayurveda- and science-based experiments needs to connect the basic science of rasa shastra, the study of herbometallic medicines in ayurveda, to clinical data.","According to Elucidating the nanomaterialistic basis for ayurvedic bhasmas using physicochemical experimentation, bhasmas are herbometallic medicines used in Ayurveda. These are derived from the study of rasa shastra. However, the biomedical science community does not currently acknowledge the validity of these bhasmas. An algorithm that integrates Ayurveda and science-based experiments could potentially connect the basic science of rasa shastra to clinical data."
Can Ayurvedic treatments be an alternative for conventional infertility treatments,"BACKGROUND Treatment of female infertility has been growing globally in recent years. In spite of improvements in medical strategies and the improved outcomes for infertile couples, treatment attempts remain largely unsuccessful. A growing number of patients pursue complementary and alternative medicine treatment options like Ayurveda that offers a variety of inpatient and outpatient treatments for infertility. CASE REPORT A case of a 38 year-old woman with infertility of unknown origin is presented. She received 18 conventional fertility treatments in 5 different fertility centers and 3 different countries. After several complications, the patient quitted conventional treatment and admitted to an Ayurvedic outpatient clinic where she received a complex Ayurvedic treatment, which included botanicals, dietary and lifestyle advice, manual therapy, yoga, and spiritual elements. The patient then became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy boy in 2012. CONCLUSIONS Ayurveda may be a useful complementary option in the case of futile conventional treatment attempts in female infertility. Nevertheless, the evidence base for Ayurvedic interventions remains weak and requires well-designed clinical trials. This case raises some questions, such as whether the exposure to a large number of assisted reproduction procedures can lead to more health problems than health benefits. The Ayurvedic approach to fertility strives first to improve the health of the patient leading to a higher likelihood of pregnancy. As this is a case report, we are not able to exclude temporal factors stimulating the pregnancy. However, the chronology suggests that this approach might have been an important factor in the eventual pregnancy.","According to The Effect of a Complex Multi-modality Ayurvedic Treatment in a Case of Unknown Female Infertility, a 38 year-old woman with infertility of unknown origin became pregnant after receiving a complex Ayurvedic treatment. This treatment encompassed botanicals, dietary and lifestyle advice, manual therapy, yoga, and spiritual elements. Despite the success in this case, the evidence base for Ayurvedic interventions in treating female infertility remains weak and requires further clinical trials. The Ayurvedic approach focuses on improving the overall health of the patient, which may increase the likelihood of pregnancy."

What is the safe way to use Nux vomica seeds in Ayurvedic medicine,"Strychnos nux vomica Linn.Loganaceae commonly known as Nux vomica Kupeelu, is a poisonous plant and its seeds are used widely in Ayurvedic system of medicine since time immemorial. Ayurveda advocates that nux vomica seeds are to be administered in therapeutics only after going through certain purificatory measures Shodhana. There are more than six media cows urine Go mutra, cows milk Go dugdha, cows ghee Go ghrita, Kanji thin gruel, castor oil Eranda taila and fresh ginger juice Ardraka swarasa etc., which have been reported in different classical texts of Ayurveda for proper processing of nux vomica seeds. In this study, an attempt has been made to purify the seeds by using three different methods as described in ancient treatise by using cows urine and cows milk as media alone and together. This study revealed that all the methods studied reduced the toxicity of strychnine and brucine contents in comparison to the raw seeds as determined by HPTLC. Out of these three methods maximum reduction in strychnine and brucine contents was found when the seeds were purified by keeping them in cows urine for seven days followed by boiling in cows milk for three hrs.","According to Effect of purificatory measures through cows urine and milk on strychnine and brucine content of Kupeelu Strychnos nuxvomica Linn. seeds, the Ayurvedic remedy involves using the seeds of Nux vomica Kupeelu, a poisonous plant, after undergoing certain purification processes.

"How can Ayurveda help in managing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus","Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are increasing to epidemic proportions globally. There are 400 million clinically obese adults worldwide and there are more than 220 million people who have diabetes. The global impact of these disorders is immense in terms of human suffering and economic burden. There is an urgent need for a more effective understanding of these disease processes and their management, including the use of natural strategies that are affordable and efficacious. The health care system known as Ayurveda has much to offer in this regard. Ayurveda describes a set of complex clinical disorders, collectively called Prameha, that are characterized by frequent abnormal micturition. The clinical conditions associated with Prameha correlate in many ways with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. The etiology, classification, pathogenesis, and management of Prameha are discussed at length and in detail in the Ayurvedic texts. The theoretical background and comprehensive set of strategies Ayurveda utilizes to treat Prameha may be valuable in managing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus in an efficacious and cost-effective manner.","According to Ayurvedic concept of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus, Ayurveda, a health care system, offers a comprehensive set of strategies to manage obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus.

The Ayurvedic approach may offer an efficacious and cost-effective solution for these increasing global health concerns."
What are some Ayurvedic treatments for managing Jwara,"JWARA is important and critical among all the diseases, because it affects each and every living being. Hence, it has been given first place in the classical texts of Ayurveda. Atharvaveda AV has also referred Jwara with the name Takman son of God Varuna and drugs like Kustha, Jangida and Anjana have been prescribed for its management. References with regard to Jwara are also found in other non-medical literature Viz., Mahbhrata, Purnas etc. Acrya Suruta has mentioned that, man comes to this world with Jwara and departs with it. Jwara affects the whole body, the organs of senses and also the mind. According to mythology, Jwara was originated from the hot and destructive breath of Lord Siva, which was produced from his nostrils during the paroxysms of grief and rage on the death of his wife, Durga. It attacks all persons of all ages and in all conditions. Jwara is the king of all diseases, destroyer of all creatures and severe hence a physician should be practically cautious in treating it. All these medico-historical aspects of Jwara have been presented in this article.","According to JWARA fever- a medico historical perspective, the Ayurvedic remedies for Jwara fever include the use of drugs like Kustha, Jangida and Anjana."
What role can Yoga and Naturopathy play in government health services in India,"The government of India has, over the past decade, implemented the integration of traditional, complementary and alternative medical TCAM practitioners, specifically practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy collectively known by the acronym AYUSH, in government health services. A range of operational and ethical challenges has manifested during this process of large health system reform. We explored the practices and perceptions of health system actors, in relation to AYUSH providers roles in government health services in three Indian states - Kerala, Meghalaya, and Delhi. Research methods included 196 in-depth interviews with a range of health policy and system actors and beneficiaries, between February and October 2012, and review of national, state, and district-level policy documents relating to AYUSH integration. The thematic framework approach was applied to analyze data from the interviews, and systematic content analysis performed on policy documents. We found that the roles of AYUSH providers are frequently ambiguously stated and variably interpreted, in relation to various aspects of their practice, such as outpatient care, prescribing rights, emergency duties, obstetric services, night duties, and referrals across systems of medicine. Work sharing is variously interpreted by different health system actors as complementing allopathic practice with AYUSH practice, or allopathic practice, by AYUSH providers to supplement the work of allopathic practitioners. Interactions among AYUSH practitioners and their health system colleagues frequently take place in a context of partial information, preconceived notions, power imbalances, and mistrust. In some notable instances, collegial relationships and apt divisions of responsibilities are observed. Widespread normative ambivalence around the roles of AYUSH providers, complicated by the logistical constraints prevalent in poorly resourced systems, has the potential to undermine the therapeutic practices and motivation of AYUSH providers, as well as the overall efficiency and performance of integrated health services.","According to research, The research paper Getting the water-carrier to light the lamps Discrepant role perceptions of traditional, complementary, and alternative medical practitioners in government health facilities in India does not provide specific information about Ayurvedic remedies. Instead, it discusses the integration of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy AYUSH in government health services in India and the challenges faced during this process. The paper indicates that the roles of AYUSH providers are often ambiguously stated and interpreted differently, leading to normative ambivalence and potential inefficiencies in integrated health services."
What are the active ingredients in Ayurvedic medicines,"Four thousand years ago, the medical knowledge of the Indian subcontinent was codified into a system called the Ayurveda. Ayurveda remains a vital system of medicine and drug therapy in India and elsewhere. Plant alkaloids are the primary active ingredients of Ayurvedic drugs. Today the pharmacologically active ingredients of many Ayurvedic medicines are being identified and their usefulness in drug therapy being determined.","According to Beginnings of drug therapy drug therapy in ancient India, the primary active ingredients of Ayurvedic drugs are plant alkaloids. The pharmacologically active ingredients of many Ayurvedic medicines are being identified today, determining their usefulness in drug therapy."
What are the health benefits of the Tri-phal combination in Ayurvedic medicine,"In India, since ancient times Tri-phal meaning three fruits in Sanskrit has been considered to be a combination of the following fruits -Hartak Terminalia chebula, Retz., malaka Embelica officinalis Gaertn, and Vibhtaka Terminalia belerica Roxb.. These plants are also listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Hartak and malaka have also been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times in Japan under the Japanese names of see text Kariroku and see text Annmaroku, respectively. Both have been carefully preserved as treasured drugs in the nationally important Shosoin treasure storehouse. This study attempts to clarify the description of Tri-phal in the Nvantaka, which is the second part of the Bower Manuscript Bower Ms., and examines the reasons why these plants were combined. This paper begins with a summary description of Tri-phal in the context of traditional Asian medicine, followed by the delineation of drug selection principles in Ayurveda. Tri-phal formulas in the Nvantaka are then examined. The Carakasamhit CS treats Tri-phal as a purifier and tonic rasyana, describing it as a formula for rejuvenation and longevity. On the other hand, the Susrutasamhitd SS regards Tri-phal as having the efficacy of balancing kapha phlegm and pitta bile, and also as being a medicine to promote excretion and enhance digestive functions for better nutritional intake. It is described to have an effect of curing diseases by keeping the tridhu theree element valance. Tri-phal is thus used as an ingredient of laxatives for diseases that result from kapha imbalance and tonic. The Angahdayasamhit AHS considers Tri-phal to have a particular superiority among cure-all medicines with the power to dispel illness. It controls kapha and overcomes blood diseases. Tri-phal formulas found in the Nvantaka were prescribed for the treatment of abdominal tumors induced by vyu wind disorder as well as for coughs caused by pitta and kapha disorder. Tri-phal was also administered to facilitate nutrient absorption, regulate bowel function, and promote excretion. Tri-phal thus restores the balance of tridhu by facilitating water distribution in the body. For these reasons, the optimal combination of Tri-phal was then established to adjust kapha for most efficient purification effects.","According to Tri-phal Three Myrobalans as Described in the Second Part of the Bower Manuscript, the Nvantaka, Tri-phal, a combination of Hartak Terminalia chebula, Retz., malaka Embelica officinalis Gaertn, and Vibhtaka Terminalia belerica Roxb., is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy used for various medicinal purposes.

What are some Ayurvedic plants that can help with chronic inflammation,"Inflammation, although first characterized by Cornelius Celsus, a physician in first Century Rome, it was Rudolf Virchow, a German physician in nineteenth century who suggested a link between inflammation and cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, pulmonary diseases, neurological diseases and other chronic diseases. Extensive research within last three decades has confirmed these observations and identified the molecular basis for most chronic diseases and for the associated inflammation. The transcription factor, Nuclear Factor-kappaB NF-kappaB that controls over 500 different gene products, has emerged as major mediator of inflammation. Thus agents that can inhibit NF-kappaB and diminish chronic inflammation have potential to prevent or delay the onset of the chronic diseases and further even treat them. In an attempt to identify novel anti-inflammatory agents which are safe and effective, in contrast to high throughput screen, we have turned to reverse pharmacology or bed to benchside approach. We found that Ayurveda, a science of long life, almost 6,000 years old, can serve as a goldmine for novel anti-inflammatory agents used for centuries to treat chronic diseases. The current review is an attempt to provide description of various Ayurvedic plants currently used for treatment, their active chemical components, and the inflammatory pathways that they inhibit.","According to Identification of novel anti-inflammatory agents from Ayurvedic medicine for prevention of chronic diseases reverse pharmacology and bedside to bench approach, Ayurveda, a 6,000-year-old science of life, offers a variety of plants that have been used to treat chronic diseases.

What can ancient Indian botany teach us about natural remedies in Ayurveda,"Vkyurvda of Parara is a great contribution to the Botany in ancient India. N.N. Sircar and Roma sarkar edited this text with English translation. Notes with comparative references of modern botany were added. This book can be placed in all probability in between 1st century B.C to 4th century A.D by its linguistic style. Many scientific branches of Botany including origin of life, ecology, distribution of forests, morphology, classification, nomenclature, histology and physiology were dealt in this ancient work. Though it is presumed that this book was written by Parara to teach Botany to preparatory to Ayurvda studies to ancient Ayurvda students, it is true to the Ayurvda personals and other disciplines related to Botany of present day as well. Aim of this article is to attract the attention of all scholars who are related to Ayurvda and Botany and to feel the depth of the knowledge of ancient Indian botany.","According to Vkyurvda of parara--an ancient treatise on plant science, the ancient text by Parara, called Vkyurvda, is a significant resource in the field of botany and Ayurveda.

What are some medicinal plants mentioned in the Old Testament that can be used for treating ailments,"The study of history of medical science from non-medical sources needs no apology. At first the discussion of what was thought in the past rather than what is known now appears to be of merely antiquarian value.

This paper is dealt in two ways - components, which accelerate or trigger an early onset of aging and measures adopted to reverse them.","According to The biology of aging JARA an ayurvedic approach, Rasyana is a key Ayurvedic remedy that is not exclusively related to old age but can be applied from pediatrics to geriatrics. Rasyana is described as a measure that prolongs and provides positive health, improves mental faculties, and provides resistance and immunity against diseases. It is also recognized as a method of obtaining optimum nourishment to the Dhtus. The paper also mentions measures to reverse the components that accelerate or trigger an early onset of aging."
What kind of antibacterial properties do aromatic herbs like Thymus vulgaris have,"The aromatic substances of natural origin are used medicinally in Ayurveda, and can have diverse bio-dynamic actions. The existing methods like agar-cup method or disc diffusion method are not adequate to study the exclusive antibacterial effects of the volatile components of aromatic oils due to lack of ideal diffusion and evaporation from the surface. Hence an attempt is made to develop a novel approach to assess the antibacterial activity of few aromatic herbs like Eugenia caryophyllus, Thymus vulgaris, Cinnamonum zeylanium, Cuminum cyminum these were extracted with hexane filled in tiny sterile tubes and the volatile components were tested for their antibacterial properties using standard strains of gram ve and gram -ve bacteria grown on agar slants. The results are expressed as a percent of inhibition of the area on the slants, from the top of the extract tube. Of the four herbs selected, volatile components of Thymus vulgaris were most effective againsts all the seven test organisms.","According to A novel approach to study antibacterial properties of volatile components of selected Indian medicinal herbs, the volatile components of the herb Thymus vulgaris commonly known as thyme were found to be the most effective in exhibiting antibacterial properties against tested bacteria. The herb was extracted with hexane and tested against standard strains of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The effectiveness was measured as a percentage of inhibition of the bacterias growth area on agar slants."
What does the Atharvaveda suggest about the use of charms and amulets in comparison to traditional medicine,"The Atharvaveda AV is by all accounts a curious compendium of medicine in its various stages of evolution and contains the most primitive as well as some of the most highly developed stages of therapy. In AV the word Brahma was used in the sense of Physician. The name Atharvan is almost synonymous with Bhesaja or medicine. The AV represents the charm system of the Ayurveda of the Vedic age. The refrain of AV is that, charms and amulets are more efficacious than herbs and medicine. Kyaikitsa general medicine is one of the eight branches of Ayurveda, which has exhaustive mention in the AV and helps to establish the continuity of medical tradition in the Vedic period. Hence some scholars had mentioned Ayurveda as Upaveda or Upnga of AV. AV mentions a large number of diseases both major and minor some where in clear terms and some where vaguely. The term used in AV for disease is Yaksma. Classification of the diseases based on a etiological factors is not found in AV. Thus this article depicts the views expressed in AV i.e. regarding causative factors, classification and number of medical disorders with special reference to Yakma Consumption.","According to General medicine in Atharvaveda with special reference to Yaksma consumptiontuberculosis, the Atharvaveda AV is a significant source of Ayurvedic medical knowledge, with a particular focus on charms and amulets as effective forms of therapy. It extensively mentions Kyaikitsa, a branch of Ayurveda that deals with general medicine. The AV also provides information about a large number of diseases, both major and minor. However, it does not classify these diseases based on etiological factors. The term used for disease in AV is Yaksma, referring to consumption or tuberculosis."
What are some Ayurvedic treatments for skin diseases as described in the Ranbir Prakash,"A reliable estimate is that one in twenty people has a skin disease. The quest for health which started with the advent of man on the horizon of this universe is still continuing. Such an attempt was also made during the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Jammu Kashmir, when Ranbir Prakash a compendium of different. Ayurvedic texts came into existence. In the present paper it is tried to bring forth the different therapeutic regimens for the management of different skin afflictions described under Kushtha roga in the Ranbir Prakash.","According to Skin diseases - management with reference to Ranbir Prakash, the Ayurvedic text Ranbir Prakash describes various therapeutic regimens for the management of different skin diseases, collectively referred to as Kushtha roga."
What natural remedies were used in ancient India to treat symptoms of Parkinsons disease,"The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism was identified in ancient India even before the period of Christ and was treated methodically. The earliest reference to bradykinesia dates to 600 bc. Evidences prove that as early as 300 bc, Charaka proposed a coherent picture of parkinsonism by describing tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances as its components. The scenario was further developed by Madhava, Vagbhata, and Dalhana all through history. The 15th-century classic Bhasava rajyam introduced the term kampavata, which may be regarded as an ayurvedic analogue of parkinsonism. The pathogenesis of kampavata centered on the concept of imbalance in the vata factor, which controls psychomotor activities. The essential element in therapy was the administration of powdered seed of Mucuna pruriens, or atmagupta, which as per reports, contains 4-6 of levodopa. In addition to proving the existence and identification of parkinsonism in ancient India, the study points to the significance of ancient Indian Sanskrit works in medical history.","According to The history of parkinsonism descriptions in ancient Indian medical literature, the key Ayurvedic remedy for parkinsonism, or kampavata, as it was historically known, was the administration of powdered seed of Mucuna pruriens, also known as atmagupta. The seed reportedly contains 4-6 of levodopa, which supports its use in treating symptoms of parkinsonism such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances. The therapeutic approach was based on the concept of restoring balance to the vata factor, which controls psychomotor activities."
What are some traditional treatments for plaque psoriasis,"OBJECTIVES Plaque psoriasis is very embarrassing condition of skin as it produces itchy rashes and scaly lesions which may not respond well to the treatment. It can be correlated with Kitibhakushta which is one among the 18 types of Kushta skin diseases. Several corticosteroids for skin applications are used now a days which gives only temporary relief. CASE PRESENTATION A 36 years old moderate built male patient complains of blackish skin rashes with itching, pain and scaling all over the body for three months. Based on the symptoms, Dosha Biological humors involved were assessed as Kapha binding factors and Vata vital force of life and suggestive of Kitibhakushta. Diagnosis of the Plaque psoriasis was further confirmed by biopsy. Classical Kushta treatment was adopted here. As Poorvakarma pre-operative procedures, Rukshana Dehydrating therapy was done and then Snehapana intake of medicated ghee was administered. Then classical Vamana emetic therapy and Virechana purgative therapy were performed. This took almost one month. After Samsarjana special diet patient was administered Manibhadragula as Shodhana Rasayana for a period of one month. At the end of Manibhadragula intake, remarkable changes were observed in all the symptoms. There were significant changes seen in PASI, DLQI and photographs taken before and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS Here the special mode of administration of Manibhadragula as mentioned in Ashtanga Hridaya helps for Shodhana and the Shodhana itself has Rasayana action. Drugs also have Rasayana property. This made the authors to propose a new concept called Shodhana Rasayana. Classical treatment by considering the condition of Roga disease and Rogi patient helps for management of Kushta.","According to Management of psoriasis with Ayurveda Panchakarma and Manibhadragula as Shodhana Rasayana - a case report, the Ayurvedic remedy for plaque psoriasis, correlated with Kitibhakushta, involves a series of treatments.

What are some herbal remedies for treating and managing urinary stones,"ETHANOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE The process of formation or appearance of a urinary stone anywhere in the renal tract is known as urolithiasis. It is a longstanding health problem, known to exist since early age of civilization. Records about symptoms, signs and treatment strategies of urinary stones diseases are found in the several ancient texts of traditional medicines such as Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM, Siddha and Unani. In Ayurveda, urolithiasis has been considered as one of the eight most troublesome diseases. Ayurvedic management and cure of urinary stone involves herbal formulas, alkaline liquids and surgical procedures. Whereas, TCM recommends polyherbal drugs, acupuncture and mexibustion for treatment of the urinary stones. Among these therapies, herbal remedies are in practice till today for the treatment and cure urinary stone diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS A comprehensive review of the scientific literature about pathophysiology of urinary stones and antiurolithiatic plants was undertaken using the following bibliographic databases MEDLINEPubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from publications from all years until Dec., 2015 by combination of the search terms and Boolean operators urinary stone OR kidney stone AND plant OR medicine OR antiurolithiatic plants. Outputs were restricted to those completed studies only published in English. In this review, literatures about plants which are used as diuretic andor in treatment urinary tract infections have not also been considered. The Plant List and Royal Botanical Garden, Kew databases were used to authenticate botanical names of plants. Books and monographs published in English were used to collect information about historical records of antiurolithiatic plants. RESULTS Recent pharmacological interventions accredited ancient antiurolithiatic claims to several plants and their formulations. The majority of antiurolithiatic plants were found to either dissolve the stones or inhibit the process of urinary stone formation. Plants such as Phyllanthus niruri L. and Elymus repens L. Gould, as well as herbal products including Wu-Ling-San formula, Cystone and Herbmed have been proved their utility as promising antiurolithiatic medicines in the different phases of clinical trials. In addition, some of the isolated phytochemicals such as berberine, lupeol, khelin, visnagin, 7-hydroxy-2,4,5-trimethoxyisoflavone and 7-hydroxy-4-methoxyisoflavone were reported to have potent antiurolithiatic activity. CONCLUSION In ancient medicinal texts, antiurolithiatic potential has been ascribed to several plants and their formulations. Present scientific studies provide scientific evidences for few of these claims however, they are insufficient to establish many of these plants and herbal formulations as therapeutic remedies for the treatment and management of urinary stones. Conversely, findings of pre-clinical and clinical studies about some plants and herbal formulations are promising, which underlines the utility of herbal remedies as alternative medicines for the treatment and management of urinary stones in the future.","According to Herbal remedies for urinary stones used in India and China A review, Ayurvedic management and cure of urinary stones involve the use of herbal formulas and alkaline liquids.

Can Ayurvedic treatments be effective for chronic rhinosinusitis,"OBJECTIVES This article provides a comprehensive systematic review and qualitative analysis of the current research investigating Ayurveda chronic rhinosinusitis CRS treatment. CONTENT PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews was followed and our search utilized MEDLINE, Embase, Ayush Portal, and Cochrane Library databases. Articles published prior to March 2022, 10 or more patients that investigated Ayurveda as a treatment for CRS in humans were included. This resulted in thirteen articles meeting inclusion criteria. Ayurvedic treatments included herbal medications for oral consumption, nasal instillation, and steam inhalation used alone or in combination. All studies concluded that Ayurvedic therapy led to improvements in subjective CRS symptoms and objective radiographic and hematologic criteria. However, all 13 studies had a significant risk of bias due to study design and statistical methods utilized. SUMMARY Ayurvedic therapy may be a useful CRS treatment for some patients and overall appears to be well tolerated. However, definitive recommendation for when Ayurvedic treatments would be beneficial in the treatment of CRS remains not possible. OUTLOOK Given the overall positive effects shown in the current published evidence and growing interest in complementary and integrative therapies, Ayurvedic treatments for CRS deserve further investigation in the form of well-designed controlled trials.","According to Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis a systematic review of randomized and non-randomized trials, Ayurvedic treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis CRS include herbal medications for oral consumption, nasal instillation, and steam inhalation used alone or in combination.

Can Ayurvedic treatments like Nasya oils help alleviate the symptoms of Ardita or facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND Ardita facial paralysis is a medical condition that disfigures or distorts the facial appearance of the sufferer causing facial asymmetry and malfunction. Ardita patients may benefit from considering alternative treatments such as Ayurveda, including Taila Nasya nasal instillation of medicated oil. OBJECTIVES To synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of different Nasya oils in the treatment of Ardita. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS Studies conducted on adult sufferers 18-70 years of Ardita chronic or acute in any setting were considered. Studies including participants who were pregnant or suffered allergic rhinitis, fever, intracranial tumorhemorrhage and bilateral facial palsy were excluded. INTERVENTIONSCOMPARATORS Standalone treatment of Nasya at all dosages and frequencies compared to Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic treatments was considered. Comparisons between different interventions including Taila Nasya alone, Taila Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic interventions and Ayurvedic interventions that did not include Taila Nasya were also considered. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in Ardita symptoms, including facial distortion, speech disorders and facial pain, were measured. TYPES OF STUDIES All quantitative study designs experimental, quasi-experimental and observational were considered. SEARCH STRATEGY Relevant studies were identified following a comprehensive literature search. References provided within these key studies identified additional resources. Indian universities were also contacted for results of Ardita studies undertaken in their institutions.A three-step search strategy aimed to find studies of published and unpublished studies was undertaken. Studies published in the English language were considered for inclusion, irrespective of publication dateyear. Following an initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL, the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe each articles were analyzed. From the identified keywords and index terms, searches were undertaken across all relevant databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Centre for Review and Dissemination databases, Turning Research into Practice TRIP, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, DHARA, Google Scholar, MedNar and ProQuest Dissertations. Finally, reference lists of identified theses and articles were searched for additional studies. Universities and website operators related to Ayurvedic research in India were contacted, including the National Institute of Ayurveda for relevant studies. Besides this, the University of Adelaide librarian was contacted to retrieve those studies identified in the reference lists of theses and articles. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Studies were critically assessed by the review author and a secondary reviewer prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION Data was extracted by the primary reviewer using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS Different interventions and comparators across studies precluded meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS Only two pseudo randomized studies with a small number of participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study with 20 participants, divided equally into two groups compared the effectiveness of two nasal instillations in alleviating four Ardita symptoms. The second study of 15 participants each in two groups compared the effectiveness of nasal instillation with placement of medicated oil on the head on seven Ardita symptoms. Observational measurements of Ardita symptoms were graded as Mild, Moderate or Marked at baseline and after one month. The study conducted on 30 participants using Nasya intervention showed participants had better relief from the symptoms of facial pain, speech disorder and earache within the range of 78.2 to 90.9, graded as Marked. Along with statistical data available in the studies, this review found low levels of evidence favoring Taila Nasya intervention. The review did not include any studies examining effectiveness of Nasya compared to conventional treatment for Ardita. CONCLUSIONS This review presents extremely limited evidence from only two small experimental studies that administration of Nasya oil alone may provide some relief from Ardita symptoms of facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to shut eyelidsupward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. No strong conclusions may be drawn from the evidence included in the review due to the limited number of studies, limited number of participants and poor quality of studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Practitioners should advice Ardita patients that there is extremely limited evidence suggesting the potential effectiveness of Nasya oils alone or Nasya in conjunction with other Ayurvedic treatments in managing symptoms. However, given the absence of a strong evidence base, practitioners should be guided by clinical wisdom and patient preference. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Well controlled clinical trials comparing standalone Nasya therapy to other Ayurvedic treatments andor conventional medicine for Ardita symptoms need to be conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of different Nasya oils in treating Ardita.","According to The effectiveness of ayurvedic oil-based nasal instillation Nasya medicines in the treatment of facial paralysis Ardita a systematic review, Ardita facial paralysis patients may benefit from the Ayurvedic treatment of Taila Nasya, which is the nasal instillation of medicated oil.

The Nasya treatment showed potential relief from Ardita symptoms such as facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to shut eyelidsupward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva. The relief from symptoms of facial pain, speech disorder, and earache ranged from 78.2 to 90.9. No studies examined"
What natural remedies could help with inflammation and ulcers,"Pongamia pinnata root has been advocated in Ayurveda for treatment of various inflammatory and infective conditions including ulcers. Sequential petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, acetone and ethanolic extracts of P. pinnata roots when administered in the dose of 50 mgkg, i.p. in rats was found to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic activity while pentobarbitone-induced sleep time was reduced by all the extracts except petroleum ether which, however, enhanced it. They were also found to possess antiulcer effects when administered either by i.p. 45 min before or oral route 45 min before or for 4 days against restraint-stress or pylorus-ligated gastric ulcers in rats, the maximum protection being afforded by petroleum ether and ethanol extracts. The mechanism of antiulcer effect could either be due to decrease in acid-pepsin secretion and augmentation of mucin secretion as observed with ethanol extract, while petroleum ether extract might be producing the effect by virtue of its anti-stress activity.","According to Pharmacological actions of Pongamia pinnata roots in albino rats, the root of Pongamia pinnata, a plant used in Ayurvedic medicine, has been found to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antiulcer effects. The study found that administering 50 mgkg of the root extracts produced these effects in rats. The most effective extracts for antiulcer effects were petroleum ether and ethanol extracts. The ethanol extract was observed to decrease acid-pepsin secretion and increase mucin secretion, while the petroleum ether extract seemed to work through its anti-stress activity."
How can environmental factors influence the transmission of COVID-19 according to Ayurvedic principles,"Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 transmission on different levels showed that the cold and dry climate, hot wind and relative humid wind, maximum wind speed, turbulent wind, intensified recirculating flow were causing transmission higher than factors. The role of environmental factors described in Ayurveda like air, water, soil, season, frequent earthquakes, sunlight exposure, frequent thunderstorm with lightening, and factors from arthropods were revalidated in perspective of COVID-19 transmission. The authors searched the information regarding epidemic diseases in Ayurveda textbooks. Pubmed, Science Direct, Wikipedia, Elsevier, Lancet, and Springer were approached for the latest knowledge relating to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Google Scholar search engine was thoroughly checked upon for scientific evidence regarding the Ayurveda drugs. Various environmental factors like soil, air, water, frequent earthquake disasters, wildlife animals, aquatic birds, space, inevitable disastrous factors, weather or seasonal hazards, violent thunderstorm with lightning, intermediate hosts, sunlight exposure etc. were considered for their role in the genesis of the disease. The Ayurvedic concepts behind the etiology and development of epidemics are the same as modern epidemiological theories. The mysteries of many aspects of the current pandemic might be deciphered by traditional medicine knowledge and thus adding upon to the integrative medicine concept.","According to Transmission modes of COVID-19 disease pandemic in the light of ancient wisdom of Ayurveda medicine a review, the transmission of COVID-19 can be influenced by various environmental factors highlighted in Ayurveda such as air, water, soil, seasonal changes, frequent earthquakes, sunlight exposure, and frequent thunderstorms with lightning. The authors have used Ayurvedic concepts to explain the etiology and development of epidemics, aligning them with modern epidemiological theories. The study suggests that understanding these Ayurvedic principles may provide insights into the current pandemic, potentially contributing to integrative medicine strategies. However, the abstract does not mention any specific Ayurvedic remedies for treating or preventing COVID-19."
What are some Ayurvedic treatments that are considered effective for osteoarthritis,"Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing systems within complementary and alternative medicine. However, the evidence for its effectiveness is unsatisfactory. The aim of this work was to review and meta-analyze the effectiveness and safety of different Ayurvedic interventions in patients with osteoarthritis OA. 138 electronic databases were searched through August 2013. Randomized controlled trials, randomized crossover studies, cluster-randomized trials, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials were eligible. Adults with pre-diagnosed OA were included as participants. Interventions were included as Ayurvedic if they were explicitly labeled as such. Main outcome measures were pain, physical function, and global improvement. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 19 randomized and 14 non-randomized controlled trials on 12 different drugs and 3 non-pharmaceutical interventions with a total of 2,952 patients were included. For the compound preparation, Rumalaya, large and apparently unbiased effects beyond placebo were found for pain standardized mean difference SMD -3.73 95 confidence interval CI -4.97, -2.50 P 0.01 and global improvement risk ratio 12.20 95 CI 5.83, 25.54 P 0.01. There is also some evidence that effects of the herbal compound preparation Shunti-Guduchi are comparable to those of glucosamine for pain SMD 0.08 95 CI -0.20, 0.36 P 0.56 and function SMD 0.15 95 CI -0.12, 0.36 P 0.41. Based on single trials, positive effects were found for the compound preparations RA-11, Reosto, and Siriraj Wattana. For Boswellia serrata, Lepidium Sativum, a Boswellia serrata containing multicomponent formulation and the compounds Nirgundi Taila, Panchatikta Ghrita Guggulu, and Rhumayog, and for non-pharmacological interventions like Ayurvedic massage, steam therapy, and enema, no evidence for significant effects against potential methodological bias was found. No severe adverse events were observed in all trials. The drugs Rumalaya and Shunti-Guduchi seem to be safe and effective drugs for treatment of OA-patients, based on these data. However, several limitations relate to clinical research on Ayurveda. Well-planned, well-conducted and well-published trials are warranted to improve the evidence for Ayurvedic interventions.","According to Ayurvedic interventions for osteoarthritis a systematic review and meta-analysis, the Ayurvedic compound preparation Rumalaya shows significant effects for pain relief and global improvement in osteoarthritis patients.

How can practicing martial arts improve overall health and well-being,"This paper describes three interconnected conceptions of the body in kalarippayattu, the martial tradition of Kerala, South India. It traces continuities and discontinuities among concepts and practices recorded in classic source texts and contemporary martial practice for each of the three bodies of practice. The first is the fluid body of humors and saps. The second is the body as superstructure composed of bones, muscles, and vital spots marma-s, which supports the fluid body. The concepts and practices of the first two bodies are based on the regional tradition of Ayurveda. They constitute the external physical body sthula-arira. The third, subtle or interior body suksma-arira is thought to be encased within the physical body. It provides an experiential map of practice and is the basis for higher stages of meditation. The long-term practice of the martial art 1 makes the body fluid so that healthful congruence of the humors occurs, 2 establishes an intuitive and practical knowledge of vital points marma useful in fighting prayogam and in treating injuries, and 3 purifies the subtle body and awakens the internal vital energy prana-vayu that is manifest as the power akti of the master in combat or medical practice. The paper concludes with a discussion of the interrelationship between these three concepts of the body in the accomplished practice of the martial practitioner.","According to Three bodies of practice in a traditional South Indian martial art, the martial tradition of kalarippayattu in Kerala, South India, promotes health and well-being through three interconnected conceptions of the body.

Which plants have been studied for their potential to help the body adapt to stress,"Plants from all over the world such as Eleutherococcus senticosus, Panax ginseng, Raponticum carthamoides, Rhodiola rosea, Withania somnifera and Ocimum sanctum have been extensively evaluated for their adaptogenic potential. However, none of them has been successfully introduced as an adaptogen in the clinic. This paper discusses some of the problems in evaluation of adaptogens which have precluded their inclusion as clinically useful drugs. We further discuss our results with six rasayana plants from Ayurveda, which were studied for their adaptogenic potential. The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of selected plants Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula were administered orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested. All the plants reversed the effects of cisplatin on gastric emptying, while Tinospora cordifolia and Asparagus racemosus also normalized cisplatin induced intestinal hypermotility. Tinospora cordifolia was also tested for its ability to modulate the changes occurring in the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages after exposure of rats to either carbon tetrachloride or horse serum. It was found to normalize the phagocytic function irrespective to the direction of change, complying to the definition of an adaptogen. All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.","According to Adaptogenic properties of six rasayana herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine, the six rasayana plants from Ayurveda that were studied for their adaptogenic potential are Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withania somnifera, Piper longum, and Terminalia chebula.

"Are the medicinal plants from West Bengal, India safe from harmful levels of heavy and trace metals","Traditionally, the herbal drugs are well established for their therapeutic benefits. Depending upon their geographical sources sometimes the trace and heavy metals content may differ, which may lead to severe toxicity. So, the toxicological and safety assessment of these herbal drugs are one of the major issues in recent days. Eight different plant species including Aloe vera, Centella asiatica, Calendula officinalis, Cucumis sativus, Camellia sinensis, Clitoria ternatea, Piper betel and Tagetes erecta were selected to determine their heavy and trace metals content and thereby to assure their safer therapeutic application. The trace and heavy metals were detected through atomic absorption spectrometry analysis. The selected medicinal plant materials were collected from the local cultivated regions of West Bengal, India, and were digested with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid as specified. Absorbance was measured through atomic absorption spectrometer AA 303 and the concentration of different trace and heavy metals in the plant samples were calculated. The quantitative determinations were carried out using standard calibration curve obtained by the standard solutions of different metals. The contents of heavy metals were found to be within the prescribed limit. Other trace metals were found to be present in significant amount. Thus, on the basis of experimental outcome, it can be concluded that the plant materials collected from the specific region are safe and may not produce any harmful effect of metal toxicity during their therapeutic application. The investigated medicinal plants contain trace metals such as copper Cu, chromium Cr, manganese Mn, iron Fe and nickel Ni as well as heavy metals such as arsenic As, lead Pb and mercury Hg, which were present within the permissible limit.","According to Determination of trace and heavy metals in some commonly used medicinal herbs in Ayurveda, the herbal drugs from eight different plant species including Aloe vera, Centella asiatica, Calendula officinalis, Cucumis sativus, Camellia sinensis, Clitoria ternatea, Piper betel and Tagetes erecta, were analyzed for their heavy and trace metals content. The plants, collected from the local cultivated regions of West Bengal, India, were found to have their heavy metals within the prescribed limit, and other trace metals were present in significant amount.

What are some Ayurvedic practices that can help slow down the aging process,"Research on aging in India has been well documented since ancient times. As way back as 3000-1500 BC, the Indian medical system of Ayurveda was used as a means for the prevention of the effects of aging and generation of disease in organs or the whole organism, respectively. In recent years, the focus has been demographic studies on different aspects of aging and has been in isolation. Molecular aspects of aging have been addressed only by a few groups of scientists which has focused on regulation of gene expression, DNA damage and repair, development of immunochemical reagents to detect oxidative DNA damage and assessing the levels of circulating antibodies to reactive oxygen species modified DNA ROS-DNA, etc. This review aims to recapitulate various research studies on aging since 3000 BC to date.","According to Aging research in India, the Indian medical system of Ayurveda has been used since 3000-1500 BC for the prevention of the effects of aging and the generation of disease in organs or the whole organism.

How can Ayurvedic medicine help manage Parkinsons disease symptoms,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Medicinal plants like Mucuna pruriens L.DC and Withania somnifera L.Dunal have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to manage neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsons disease. AIM The aim of this review is to share the role of Ayurvedas insights, traditional usage and contemporary investigations for translational, integrative applications to manage Idiopathic Parkinsons Disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS High impact journals for Parkinsons diseases, traditional textbooks from Ayurveda as well as relevant clinical and para clinical studies with botanicals are selectively incorporated to evolve the aforesaid translational application. RESULTS . A. CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING AND EXISTING THERAPEUTIC GAPS Parkinsons disease PD is a complex multi-system, neurodegenerative disease. Though predominantly perceived as a motor disease, it also has debilitating non- motor features, which are frequently missed and not treated. Major treatment goals are to increase striatal dopamine levels with precursor-substitution andor reduce its breakdown. As the disease progresses, a steady increase in the dose of levodopa is inevitable. However, higher doses cause motor complications of dyskinesia and dystonia and compromise medical treatment. B. ROLE OF MUCUNA PRURIENS L.DC, THE MOST PROMISING BOTANICAL FROM AYURVEDA Ayurveda offers a natural source of levodopa - the seeds of Mucuna pruriens L.DC- which have a long standing safe use in the condition. Its clinical studies have shown pharmacokinetic profile distinct from synthetic levodopa, which is likely to reduce the untoward motor complications. Additionally, its seed extracts have shown neuroprotective benefits which are unrelated to levodopa. C. AYURVEDIC REGIMENS AND MEDICINAL PLANTS FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE AND SYMPTOMATIC BENEFITS Other regimens Panchakarma and medicinal plants used in Ayurveda have been subjected to exploratory studies with promising early results in the condition. The debilitating non motor symptoms in patients have shown response with one of the regimens - medicated oil enema basti. Effects of two medicinal plants Withania somniferaL.Dunal and Curcuma longa Linn in Parkinsons Disease related models have been discussed in detail. We have also shared a shortlist of medicinal plants most likely to be useful in management of specific features of the disease such as cognitive decline, mood disorders, risk of osteoporosis amongst others. CONCLUSION Ayurveda with its medicinal plants and treatment approaches, can strengthen the therapeutic armamentarium of PD to improve clinical outcomes, if these leads are systematically further investigated by well-designed longer term studies.","According to Management of Parkinsons disease in Ayurveda Medicinal plants and adjuvant measures, Ayurveda provides several medicinal plants and treatments for managing Parkinsons Disease PD. The seeds of the Mucuna pruriens L.DC plant offer a natural source of levodopa, which has been used safely in treating PD. Clinical studies have shown that this plants pharmacokinetic profile is distinct from synthetic levodopa and is likely to reduce motor complications. Apart from levodopa, the seed extracts also have neuroprotective benefits. Other Ayurvedic regimens like Panchakarma and medicinal plants have shown promise in early studies for treating PD.

What types of herbs used in Ayurveda might have anticancer properties,"This paper critically examines the Ayurvedic concept of cancer diathesis and its pathogenesis in terms of the theory of Tridosa, Sapta Dhtus body tissues, the Agni or bodys biologic fire, Srotmsi i.e., channels of the body, and the generic sequence of events in the genesis of a disease e.g., Satkriykala. All this depicts a new paradigm of the disease state. This paper also examines the scope of plant drugs used in the treatment of cancer. A retrospective meta-analysis of observations on 85 plant drugs reported to have an anticancer effect indicates that herbs with Katu, Tikta, Kasya Rasa bitter, pungent, and astringent taste, Usna Virya e.g., hot biopotency, and Katu Vipka catabolic active metabolites, and herbs with dry, coarse, light, and sharp biophysical properties have significantly greater possibilities of producing anticancer effects.","According to An assessment of the ayurvedic concept of cancer and a new paradigm of anticancer treatment in Ayurveda, Ayurveda proposes using plant drugs for cancer treatment.

What can I do to support equal access to medical education in Nepal,"Ayurvedic medicine thrives in Nepal. Even so, barriers of untouchability that have long prevented Dalits from establishing equal relationships with upper castes have made medical education out of reach for them. Hence, nearly all Ayurvedic practitioners are high caste men. Forty years ago, an untouchable man from the Himalayan foothills with a thirst for knowledge about Ayurveda traveled south into India where he changed his caste and became a Brahman for 14 years as he studied the theory and practice of Ayurvedic medicine in a Haridwar college. Rasalijis life story, recorded initially in 2000 and continued through 2007-2008, encompasses a period of rapid modernization that spawned a state health policy promoting biomedicine, a proliferation of pharmaceutical drugs, and a national election that swept the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist into power and saw an unprecedented 9 percent Dalits elected to the Constituent Assembly. This article presents Rasalijis current concerns with the state of medicine and social justice in Nepal.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific information about Ayurvedic remedies."
What are some Ayurvedic practices for promoting a healthy and long life,"yurveda, the science ved of life ayu, owing its origin to Veda, the oldest recorded wisdom of human civilization written in 3500 BCE, contains extensive knowledge of various diseases and their therapeutic approaches. It essentially relied on nature and the immune system of an individual, and therapeutic interventions were introduced only to augment the immune system. yurveda had eight specialties, including psycho-neuroscience a combination of psychology, clinical psychology and psychiatry and a unique promotive therapy encompassing nutrition, rejuvenation and geriatrics. The symptoms of various brain disorders, including memory disorder, were well defined. The goal of yurveda was to help an individual to achieve his cherished goal of leading a healthy life of 100 years. To achieve this, great emphasis was laid on nutrition, diet and a good conduct by the two great exponents of yurveda viz. Carak and Suruta. By following these regimens, an individual could lead a less stressful life free from emotional disturbances. Both Carak and Suruta had believed that these in combination with rasayana rejuvenating plants could enable an individual to lead a healthy life of 100 years.","According to Brain enhancing ingredients from yurvedic medicine quintessential example of Bacopa monniera, a narrative review, the key Ayurvedic remedy information includes the use of therapeutic interventions to augment the immune system, a unique promotive therapy encompassing nutrition, rejuvenation, and geriatrics, and the use of rasayana rejuvenating plants.

What strategies can be implemented to preserve traditional medicinal practices in India,"BACKGROUND Traditional medicine in India can be classified into codified Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and non-codified folk medicine systems. Both the systems contributing equally to the primary healthcare in India. The present study is aimed to understand the current scenario of medicinal practices of non-codified system of traditional medicine in Belgaum region, India. METHODS The study has been conducted as a basic survey of identified non-codified traditional practitioners by convenience sampling with semi structured, open ended interviews and discussions. The learning process, disease diagnosis, treatment, remuneration, sharing of knowledge and socio-demographic data was collected, analysed and discussed. RESULTS One hundred and forty traditional practitioners were identified and interviewed for the present study. These practitioners are locally known as Vaidya. The study revealed that the non-codified healthcare tradition is practiced mainly by elderly persons in the age group of 61 years and above 40. 73 of the practitioners learnt the tradition from their forefathers, and 19 of practitioners developed their own practices through experimentation, reading and learning. 20 of the practitioners follow distinctive Nadi Pariksha pulse examination for disease diagnosis, while others follow bodily symptoms and complaints. 29 of the traditional practitioners do not charge anything, while 59 practitioners receive money as remuneration.Plant and animal materials are used as sources of medicines, with a variety of preparation methods. The preference ranking test revealed higher education and migration from villages are the main reasons for decreasing interest amongst the younger generation, while deforestation emerged as the main cause of medicinal plants depletion. CONCLUSION Patrilineal transfer of the knowledge to younger generation was observed in Belgaum region. The observed resemblance in disease diagnosis, plant collection and processing between non-codified traditional system of medicine and Ayurveda require further methodical studies to establish the relationship between the two on a more objective basis. However, the practice appears to be at crossroads with threat of extinction, because of non-inheritance of the knowledge and non-availability of medicinal plants. Hence conservation strategies for both knowledge and resources at societal, scientific and legislative levels are urgently required to preserve the traditional wisdom.","According to Non-codified traditional medicine practices from Belgaum Region in Southern India present scenario, the traditional medicine practices in the Belgaum region, India, are known as non-codified healthcare tradition and are primarily practiced by elderly persons.

Can I use a questionnaire to understand my health based on the Ayurvedic theory of Tri-Dosha,"INTRODUCTION The Ayurvedic theory of Tri-Dosha offers a unique framework for understanding human differences in health and disease. The Doshas could be readily applied in clinical studies to control for such differences the same way sex, age, height and weight are routinely used except that clinical evaluation is required and methods vary. No open-source questionnaire has been shown to be reliable for self-assessment. Therefore, we undertook this study to develop a reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire with characteristics suitable for use in clinical research. METHODS A review of published questionnaires and translations of classic Ayurvedic texts along with an analysis of item-total correlations and ANOVAs by Dosha for 735 responses to a 37-item ipsative questionnaire from an Ayurveda products company served as the basis for generating 108 Dosha-specific test items featuring a 7-point Likert scale. We used item-total and inter-item correlations from a convenience sample of 176 individuals to identify the best performing items. We then solicited repeat responses to the resultant 39-item questionnaire 13 for each Dosha from these and other website visitors and calculated test-retest reliability as the intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement ICC 2,1 for each Dosha. RESULTS The final questionnaire gives normally distributed results. Among 76 self-selected adults, the test-retest reliabilities for Vata, Pitta and Kapha Dosha scores are all above 0.8. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that it is possible to quantify the three Doshas with adequate reliability for most clinical studies.","According to Development of a reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire, a reliable questionnaire for self-assessment of the three Doshas Vata, Pitta and Kapha in Ayurvedic theory has been developed.

How can the AYUSH sector contribute to the management of COVID-19,"There is a lot of discussion on COVID-19 control strategies from the mainstream approaches, but it is also necessary to examine the contributions of the Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Riga and Homeopathy AYUSH sector, which is now being brought into public health interventions nationally. Although the AYUSH sector had previously joined the management of dengue and chikungunya outbreaks in some Indian states, its participation has remained contentious and there is reluctance in mainstream public health discourses to seriously examine their interventions. This is a commentary on the efforts made by the Ministry of AYUSH, state AYUSH directorates, AYUSH research institutions, and public hospitals, based on official documents as well as official statements reported in the media, with the aim of bringing out concerns in the process of adapting traditional textual knowledge and practices to public health requirements of the current age.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific Ayurvedic remedies for COVID-19.

What are some Ayurveda remedies to manage the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy,"Chemotherapy drugs and radiotherapy are highly toxic and both damage adjacent healthy cells. Side effects may be acute occurring within few weeks after therapy, intermediate or late occurring months or years after the therapy. Some important side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, alopecia, constipation etc whereas radiation therapy though administered locally, can produce systemic side effects such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, alteration in the taste, sleep disturbance, headache, anemia, dry skin, constipation etc. Late complications of these therapies also include pharyngitis, esophagitis, laryngitis, persistent dysphagia, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, infertility and cognitive deficits. These arrays of side effects have a devastating effect on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Due to the inadequacy of most of the radio-protectors and chemo-protectors in controlling the side effects of conventional cancer therapy the complementary and alternative medicines have attracted the view of researchers and medical practitioners more recently. This review aims at providing a comprehensive management protocol of above mentioned chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects based on Ayurveda, which is an ancient system of traditional medicine practiced in Indian peninsula since 5000 BC. When the major side effects of chemo-radiotherapy are looked through an ayurvedic perspective, it appears that they are the manifestations of aggravated pitta dosha, especially under the group of disorders called Raktapitta haemorrhage or Raktadushti vascular inflammation. Based on comprehensive review of ancient vedic literature and modern scientific evidences, ayurveda based interventions are put forth. This manuscript should help clinicians and people suffering from cancer to combat serious chemo-radiotherapy related side effects through simple but effective home-based ayurveda remedies. The remedies described are commonly available and safe. These simple ayurveda based solutions may act as an important adjuvant to chemo-radiotherapy and enhance the quality of life of cancer patients.","According to Ayurveda for chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects in cancer patients, the major side effects of chemo-radiotherapy such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, alopecia, constipation, fatigue, anorexia, alteration in the taste, sleep disturbance, headache, anemia, dry skin, etc., are viewed as manifestations of aggravated pitta dosha in Ayurveda, especially under the group of disorders called Raktapitta haemorrhage or Raktadushti vascular inflammation.

"How can I balance my Vata, Pitta, and Kapha according to Ayurveda for better health","In ayurvedic system of medicine, it is considered that a living system is made of panch-mahabuta, in the form of Vata, pitta and kapha at the physical level and satwa, raja and tama at the mental level. This covers the psychosomatic constitution and commonly known as the Tridosh theory. The imbalance in these body humours is the basic cause of any type of disease manifestation. Till date, several objective parameters have been proposed to monitor the level of these basic humours but none of them is complete. In this exercise, now it is proposed to consider free radical theory of diseases as one of the objective parameters. To be more specific, vata can be monitored in terms of membrane bound signal transduction, pitta as the process of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of different proteins signalling moieties and enzymes and kapha can be viewed as the degree of gene expression as protein synthesis. This can be correlated with the ojas of the body or total body defence mechanism.","According to Molecular approach to ayurveda, the Ayurvedic system of medicine considers a living system to be made up of panch-mahabuta, in the form of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha at the physical level and Satwa, Raja, and Tama at the mental level, collectively known as the Tridosh theory. Imbalances in these body humours are believed to be the basic cause of disease. The paper proposes the free radical theory of diseases as a new objective parameter to monitor these humours. Specifically, Vata can be monitored through membrane bound signal transduction, Pitta through the process of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of different proteins, and Kapha through"
What dietary changes might traditional Chinese medicine suggest for overall health balance,"In some ancient systems of medicine, health was understood as a state of balance, and diet was considered essential to achieving and maintaining that balance. Traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda are based on this premise. Here we present an overview of these two traditional systems views on diet and eating. This article aims to explain the reasoning behind some of the recommendations that practitioners of these forms of medicine may be making.","According to research, The research paper does not provide specific information on Ayurvedic remedies."

What are the health benefits of taking cyavanaprsh as part of an Ayurvedic regimen,"The paper discusses the many forms and representations of cyavanaprsh, Ayurvedas best-selling medicine, already mentioned in Carakas Compendium c. 200 CE. The medicines compositions, applications, and meanings, change over time and from locality to locality. Cyavanaprsh is, for example, a patriotic formula, a booster of the immune system, a modern geriatric drug, and one of the elements in canonical Ayurvedic treatments. In the beginning of the 19th century cyavanaprsh was a patriotic formula for fortifying Indian bodies and the nascent Indian nation. Nowadays the medicine is a Fast Moving Consumer Good FMCG and a money maker for Dabur India Ltd., the world largest Ayurvedic manufacturer. Instead of vitalising the nation its consumption now promises to make urban middle class consumers effectively modern. Branding and modern science must make Dabur Chyawanprash attractive in the eyes of these consumers. Ayurveda and cyavanaprsh are also part of a global counter culture marked by neo-Orientalism and Ayurvedic medicines as facilitators of spirituality. The marketing of cyavanaprsh by Indias largest Ayurvedic manufacturer is used as a case study for discussing the proliferation of Ayurvedic brands and its critics. The imaging of Ayurvedic brands such as Dabur Chyawanprash threatens to obscure the fact that Ayurveda represents a unique way of looking upon health, disease and the human body. The proliferation of brands also makes Ayurvedic medicines more expensive and puts pressure on the natural environment as the main supplier of Ayurvedic ingredients.","According to Assembling cyavanaprsh, Ayurvedas best-selling medicine, Cyavanaprsh is a well-recognized Ayurvedic remedy that has been in use since approximately 200 CE. Its uses and formulations have varied over time and location.

What precautions should I take when using Ayurvedic medicines,"PURPOSE We report a case of a 30 years old Indian sailor with microcytic anemia Hb 9.9, persistent abdominal pain, emesis, dark stool, hyperchromic urine, latent jaundice and asthenia. Lead intoxication was confirmed blood lead value of 102 gdL. The patient assumed Ayurvedic medicines in the previous months. Ayurveda is an ancient form of Indian traditional popular medicine aiming to re-establish health and body function through herbal preparations, heavy metals are often added. Our purpose was to treat the patient and to establish the source of poisoning. METHODS After testing blood and urine lead concentration of other 3 crew members and analyzing over than 150 products used on the ship professional exposure was excluded. We analyzed the two Ayurvedic drugs assumed by the patient with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The patient underwent three chelation cycles with Calcium Disodium Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA while monitoring blood and urinary lead levels. RESULTS The final blood lead level at discharge, after three chelation cycles, was 36.27 gdL. One of the two drugs contained extremely high concentrations of lead and mercury. The three different mixtures of this preparation showed lead concentrations of 12,638.54 mgkg Sample 2A, 23,043.02 mgkg Sample 2B, 21,352.97 mgkg Sample 2C these levels are much higher than the highest values reported in literature for the indian soil 32 mgkg. CONCLUSIONS This case and similar cases raise the safety alert on complementary and alternative medicines Ayurvedic medicine users should be carefully informed about potential risks and signs of poisoning.","According to Lead poisoning from Ayurvedic treatment a further case, the Ayurvedic medicines consumed by the patient were found to contain extremely high concentrations of lead and mercury.

Is the ethanol content in over-the-counter Ayurvedic formulations safe for consumption,"BACKGROUND A large part of the population of India prefers the traditional medicine ayurvedic formulations for primary health care. However, the effective quality control of herbal medicine is still a big challenge. Numerous reports indicate noncompliance with Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice GMP guidelines by the manufacturers which may lead to adverse drug reactions or toxic effects. Asava and arishta are the classical herbal dosage forms wherein fermentation occurs during production leading to the generation of ethanol. The presence of ethanol in these preparations may lead to their misuse. The self-generated ethanol is responsible for extraction of active constituents and acts as a self-preservative. As the procedure for preparation for asava and arishta is same, the ethanol content is also expected to be the same irrespective of the manufacturer. OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to assess and compare the ethanol content of some traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations available in the market. METHOD In this study, 20 formulations from 3 different manufacturers available as over-the-counter products were obtained and their ethanol contents were determined using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. RESULTS Statistically significant differences were noted in the ethanol content of various ayurvedic formulations. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and validated gas chromatographic method for estimation of ethanol in fermented ayurvedic formulations was also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSION The data generated during study reflected poor compliance of GMP guidelines by the manufacturers and hence the quality is being grossly compromised posing a safety hazard.","According to Ethanol content in traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice regulations - compromised health, asava and arishta are traditional Ayurvedic formulations where ethanol is generated during their production due to fermentation. This ethanol helps in the extraction of active constituents and also acts as a self-preservative. However, the study found significant differences in the ethanol content of various Ayurvedic formulations from different manufacturers, indicating noncompliance with Good Manufacturing Practice GMP guidelines. This noncompliance could potentially lead to adverse drug reactions or toxic effects, posing a safety hazard."

What are some Ayurvedic herbs that can help manage epilepsy symptoms,"Epilepsy, that comprises a wide spectrum of neuronal disorders and accounts for about one percent of global disease burden affecting people of all age groups, is recognised as apasmara in the traditional medicinal system of Indian antiquity commonly known as Ayurveda. Towards exploring the molecular level complex regulatory mechanisms of 63 anti-epileptic Ayurvedic herbs and thoroughly examining the multi-targeting and synergistic potential of 349 drug-like phytochemicals DPCs found therein, in this study, we develop an integrated computational framework comprising of network pharmacology and molecular docking studies. Neuromodulatory prospects of anti-epileptic herbs are probed and, as a special case study, DPCs that can regulate metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluRs are inspected. A novel methodology to screen and systematically analyse the DPCs having similar neuromodulatory potential vis--vis DrugBank compounds NeuMoDs is developed and 11 NeuMoDs are reported. A repertoire of 74 DPCs having poly-pharmacological similarity with anti-epileptic DrugBank compounds and those under clinical trials is also reported. Further, high-confidence PPI-network specific to epileptic protein-targets is developed and the potential of DPCs to regulate its functional modules is investigated. We believe that the presented schema can open-up exhaustive explorations of indigenous herbs towards meticulous identification of clinically relevant DPCs against various diseases and disorders.","According to Insights about multi-targeting and synergistic neuromodulators in Ayurvedic herbs against epilepsy integrated computational studies on drug-target and protein-protein interaction networks, epilepsy, also known as apasmara in Ayurveda, can be treated using 63 anti-epileptic Ayurvedic herbs.

What should I be aware of when considering Ayurvedic medication for treatment,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda, Indian traditional system of medicine, is practiced commonly in South East Asia and in many parts of the world. Many ayurvedic drugs contain heavy metals and may lead to metal toxicity. Of these, chronic lead poisoning is the most common. Chronic arsenic poisoning following the use of ayurvedic medication, though reported, is rare. CASE REPORTS We describe three patients who presented with features of chronic arsenic poisoning following prolonged ayurvedic medication use. The diagnosis of chronic arsenic poisoning was confirmed by high arsenic levels in the blood, urine, hair, and nails in all the three patients and in ayurvedic drug in two patients. The ayurvedic medication was discontinued and treatment with D-penicillamine started. At 6 months after treatment, blood arsenic levels returned to normal with clinical recovery in all of them. CONCLUSION Arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication is much less common than lead poisoning, though mineral ayurvedic medicines may lead to it. We used D-penicillamine as chelator and all of them recovered. Whether withdrawal of medication alone or D-penicillamine also played a role in recovery is unclear and needs to be assessed.","According to Chronic arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication, prolonged use of certain Ayurvedic medications that contain heavy metals can lead to chronic arsenic poisoning. The symptoms of this poisoning can be confirmed through high arsenic levels in the blood, urine, hair, and nails. The treatment involved discontinuing the Ayurvedic medication and beginning treatment with D-penicillamine. After six months of this treatment, blood arsenic levels returned to normal and all patients showed clinical recovery. However, it is unclear whether the recovery was due to the discontinuation of the medication alone or the combined effect of the medication withdrawal and D-penicillamine."
What are the potential risks of using Ayurveda Bhasma for treating health conditions,"Ayurveda Bhasma is a metallic-mineral preparation homogenised with herbal juices or decoctions and modified with heat treatment to apparently detoxify the heavy metals. It is widely recommended for the treatment of many disease conditions by practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine in the absence of good quality clinical trial evidence on its safety and efficacy. Heavy metal-induced liver injury is widely reported in the literature, and heavy metal adulteration of non-Bhasma-related Ayurveda and herbal products has been well described. We report a patient who developed severe liver injury requiring listing for liver transplantation for improved survival, after consumption of Bhasma for dyspepsia. This case describes the first documented case and toxicology analysis of Ayurveda Bhasma associated with severe drug-induced liver injury. Physicians must be alert regarding patients use of supposedly safe Ayurveda Bhasma that may promote acute severe liver injury in the absence of other known aetiologies.","According to Ayurveda metallic-mineral Bhasma-associated severe liver injury, Ayurveda Bhasma is a metallic-mineral preparation often recommended for the treatment of several disease conditions. However, it has been associated with severe liver injury, even prompting a need for liver transplantation in a documented case. The patient in question used Bhasma to treat dyspepsia. This indicates that despite its broad usage and supposed safety, Ayurveda Bhasma can potentially lead to acute severe liver injury."
How can knowing my Prakriti type in Ayurveda help improve my health,"In Ayurveda system of medicine individuals are classified into seven constitution types, Prakriti, for assessing disease susceptibility and drug responsiveness. Prakriti evaluation involves clinical examination including questions about physiological and behavioural traits. A need was felt to develop models for accurately predicting Prakriti classes that have been shown to exhibit molecular differences. The present study was carried out on data of phenotypic attributes in 147 healthy individuals of three extreme Prakriti types, from a genetically homogeneous population of Western India. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches were used to infer inherent structure of the data, and for feature selection and building classification models for Prakriti respectively. These models were validated in a North Indian population. Unsupervised clustering led to emergence of three natural clusters corresponding to three extreme Prakriti classes. The supervised modelling approaches could classify individuals, with distinct Prakriti types, in the training and validation sets. This study is the first to demonstrate that Prakriti types are distinct verifiable clusters within a multidimensional space of multiple interrelated phenotypic traits. It also provides a computational framework for predicting Prakriti classes from phenotypic attributes. This approach may be useful in precision medicine for stratification of endophenotypes in healthy and diseased populations.","According to Recapitulation of Ayurveda constitution types by machine learning of phenotypic traits, Ayurvedic medicine classifies individuals into seven constitution types, known as Prakriti.

It also proposes a computational framework for predicting Prakriti classes from phenotypic attributes, which could be useful in precision medicine for stratification of endophenotypes in both healthy and diseased populations."
Can Ayurvedic treatments help relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis,"BACKGROUND Allergic rhinitis AR is an immune response of the nasal mucosa to airborne allergens and involves nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge, itching of the nose, and sneezing. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may significantly affect a patients quality of life and can be associated with conditions such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. Various complementary and alternative medicine treatments have been used for this condition in clinical practice. The Ayurveda system of medicine is the most common complementary medicine system practiced in Sri Lanka. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of a decoction used in traditional Ayurveda for allergic rhinitis and its ready- to-use freeze dried formulation in comparison to an antihistamine over a period of 4 weeks on relief of symptoms in allergic rhinitis. STUDY DESIGN This is a three-arm, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with AR. Tamalakyadi decoction containing 12 ingredients TMD12, used in traditional Ayurveda and its freeze-dried formulation are the test products. The efficacy and safety of the two Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the antihistamine loratadine. Patients with symptoms of AR will be allocated randomly into the three arms after a 1-week run-in period and the medications will be given orally for 28 days. Total Nasal symptom Score TNSS of the patients will be used as the primary efficacy endpoint. TNSS will be recorded and compared between the three arms prior to visit 1, at the end of 28 days, and end of the first and second months of follow-up.

Can taking Ashwagandha help prevent COVID-19 infection,"OBJECTIVE Ashwagandha, an Indian Ayurvedic medicine is indicated to prevent COVID-19 infection. Because IL-6 and C-reactive protein are widely measured to determine risk of cytokine storm in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we studied potential interference of ashwagandha on these two assays. Previous studies indicated that ashwagandha may interfere with digoxin assay, so we also studied potential interference with digoxin assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained one ashwagandha product from India liquid extract and one product from US Herb Pharma liquid extract. We prepared two serum pool each for IL-6, C-reactive protein and digoxin by combining appropriate left-over specimens submitted to our hospital laboratory for such tests. Then aliquots of each pools were supplemented with 10, 25 or 50 L of ashwagandha extract followed by re-analysis for appropriate analyte and comparing values with original pool. RESULTS We observed negative interference of ashwagandha with IL-6 assay only Indian product showed more negative interference but C-reactive protein assay and digoxin assay were not affected. Negative interference of ashwagandha in IL-6 assay has not been reported before. CONCLUSION We conclude ashwagandha caused negative interference in IL-6 assay.","According to Technical Note Negative Interference of Ashwagandha, an Indian Ayurveda Medicine Indicated for Preventing COVID-19, in IL-6 Immunoassay, Ashwagandha, an Indian Ayurvedic medicine, is suggested to prevent COVID-19 infection.

What over-the-counter medication can help with vertigo symptoms,"February 9, 2017. The alarm on my phone was set to a pre-dawn hour. We were to leave for a holiday in the hills, a long drive that I had planned for days, eager for hours of camaraderie with the steering wheel. But the waking was a shock. The walls and ceiling of the room were swirling, my body felt as if strapped to a rotating carnival wheel. Sitting, standing, walking, nothing eased it. I threw up from the nausea. Maybe it will slow, maybe it will stop, maybe it is nothing. It is vertigo, said my cousin a doctor on the phone, and prescribed an over-the-counter medication. The world steadied. I made the drive, the vacation, but the condition was now with me, for several hours each day.","According to research, The abstract does not provide any specific Ayurvedic remedy information."
What is the role of leech therapy in Ayurvedic medicine,"This article offers vascularity as a multi-dimensional imaginary for the interspecies entanglements constituting Ayurvedic leech therapy. Whether, when, where, and how a leech decides to bite, suck, and release comprise pivotal junctures in leech therapy as practiced in southern Kerala, India. In the course of leech-human intra-actions, leeches translate matter, providing sensory mediation, relief, and amusement. Enmeshed in social and ecological relations inflected by gender, religion, class, and caste, this analysis of Ayurvedic leech therapy reframes questions of agencies starting with and from the viewpoint of the vascular capacities of leeches in their interactions with humans. This image of vascularity provides an analytic for the emergent agencies of humans and leeches constituted by sensory intra-actions at branching points in this multispecies clinical practice.","According to The Vascularity of Ayurvedic Leech Therapy Sensory Translations and Emergent Agencies in Interspecies Medicine, Ayurvedic leech therapy is a practice used in southern Kerala, India that involves the use of leeches to bite, suck, and release at specific points on the body. This therapy is believed to provide sensory mediation, relief, and amusement. The therapy and its effectiveness are influenced by the leechs decisions on when and where to bite, and their interaction with the human body, which in turn can be influenced by various social and ecological factors such as gender, religion, class, and caste."
How does Ayurvedic medicine use the concept of dry and wet lands in managing body health,"In classical Ayurvedic medicine, the jungle is the dry land of the Punjab and the Delhi Doab, an open vegetation of thorny shrubs. The polarity of dry lands and wet lands framed not only the whole Ayurvedic materia medica, but also the more general conception of a cosmic physiology governed by Agni the sun and Soma the dispenser of the rain. Clearing the land and draining the body were two aspects of one and the same art of managing the transactions of all sorts of vital fluids, saps, juices, savors and humors. Medicine in the context of thought and practice associated with the jungle was, and still is in modern India, a kind of agriculture.","According to The jungle and the aroma of meats an ecological theme in Hindu medicine, Ayurvedic medicine considers the concept of managing the transactions of various vital fluids, saps, juices, savors and humors as a key aspect of maintaining health. This concept is linked to the polarity of dry and wet lands, and the cosmic physiology governed by Agni the sun and Soma the dispenser of the rain. The practice of Ayurvedic medicine is likened to agriculture, with the act of clearing the land paralleled to draining the body to maintain balance and health."

What are some traditional Indian medicinal plants that can be used to treat skin disorders,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Traditional knowledge is a particular form of practice or skill set that was developed in ancient times and was sustained through generations via the passing of knowledge, essentially confined within a specific tribe, local people, or family lineages. Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if there is chemical, microbiological, andor clinical evidence, from a scientific perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug development. AIM OF THE STUDY We compile and emphasize the most important part of ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants against problem skin diseases as well. MATERIALS AND METHODS Different kinds of key phrases such as Indian traditional ethnodermatology, ethnodermatology, ethnobotany, skin diseases, Ayurveda dermatology, pharmacological activity were searched in online search serversdatabases such as Google Scholar httpsscholar.google.com, ResearchGate httpswww.researchgate.net, PubMed httpspubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository NOPR httpnopr.niscair.res.in. Based upon the analyses of data obtained from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants uses have been found across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against particular skin diseases. RESULTS The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. CONCLUSIONS Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today, ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be intensified.","According to Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India From ayurvedic formulations to clinical perspectives - A review, the traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their applications for various skin diseases is an integral part of ethnodermatology in India.

Can my genetic makeup influence the type of Ayurvedic treatment that would work best for me,"The practice of Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, is based on the concept of three major constitutional types Vata, Pitta and Kapha defined as Prakriti. To the best of our knowledge, no study has convincingly correlated genomic variations with the classification of Prakriti. In the present study, we performed genome-wide SNP single nucleotide polymorphism analysis Affymetrix, 6.0 of 262 well-classified male individuals after screening 3416 subjects belonging to three Prakritis. We found 52 SNPs p 1 10-5 were significantly different between Prakritis, without any confounding effect of stratification, after 106 permutations. Principal component analysis PCA of these SNPs classified 262 individuals into their respective groups Vata, Pitta and Kapha irrespective of their ancestry, which represent its power in categorization. We further validated our finding with 297 Indian population samples with known ancestry. Subsequently, we found that PGM1 correlates with phenotype of Pitta as described in the ancient text of Caraka Samhita, suggesting that the phenotypic classification of Indias traditional medicine has a genetic basis and its Prakriti-based practice in vogue for many centuries resonates with personalized medicine.","According to Genome-wide analysis correlates Ayurveda Prakriti, the practice of Ayurveda and its classification of individuals into three major constitutional types - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha known as Prakriti - has been found to have a genetic basis.

What is the potential of Ayurvedic Bhasmas as a safe alternative for designing new drugs,"In this paper, we present an overview of Ayurvedic Bhasmas as nanomedicine of herbo-metallic and mineral origin with particular attention to their structural aspects. We find, the Bhasmas as nanomedicines may offer a huge potential for designing new drugs employing the concept of nanotechnology. Thus, the standardization of fabrication process of these formulations is a crucial issue to be addressed. The structure and effectiveness of the Bhasmas as drugs depend largely on their processing history. Bhasmas are generally safe drugs for human beings in spite of the presence of seemingly toxic elements and compounds as indicated by recent studies using modern analytical techniques. Nevertheless, more systematic nanomaterialistic investigations on Bhasmas are recommended for gaining the complete and reliable composition-processing-structure-effectiveness picture of these drugs.","According to Ayurvedic Bhasmas overview on nanomaterialistic aspects, applications, and perspectives, Bhasmas are Ayurvedic remedies of herbo-metallic and mineral origin that act as nanomedicines.

What are some natural ways to improve male fertility according to Ayurveda,"Infertility is a universal health problem affecting 15 of couples, out of which 20-30 cases are due to male infertility. The leading causes of male infertility include hormonal defects, physical reasons, sexual problems, hazardous environment, stressful lifestyle, genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and oxidative stress. Various physiological functions involve reactive oxygen species ROS and nitrogen species at appropriate levels for proper smooth functioning. ROS control critical reproductive processes such as capacitation, acrosomal reaction, hyperactivation, egg penetration, and sperm head decondensation. The excessive free radicals or imbalance between ROS and endogenous antioxidant enzymes damages sperm membrane by inducing lipid peroxidation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage that eventually lead to male infertility. Numerous synthetic products are available in the market to treat infertility problems, largely ending in side effects and repressing symptoms. Ayurveda contains a particular group of Rasayana herbs, called vajikarana, that deals with nourishment and stimulation of sexual tissues, improves male reproductive vitality, and deals with oxidative stress via antioxidant mechanism. The present study aims to describe oxidative stress and the role of herbal drugs in treating male infertility.","According to Oxidative Stress and Male Infertility Role of Herbal Drugs, Ayurveda offers a solution to male infertility through the use of Rasayana herbs, specifically a group called vajikarana. These herbs are known to nourish and stimulate sexual tissues, improve male reproductive vitality, and manage oxidative stress through an antioxidant mechanism. This indicates a potential natural alternative to synthetic treatments for male infertility, which often have side effects and merely suppress symptoms."

What precautions should I take when using Ayurvedic medicine,Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient and traditional system of health care. It is safe but inadvert and unsupervised use can lead to serious health complications. Lead is a common constituent of these medicines. Here authors describe two cases of lead encephalopathy as a result of long-term ayurvedic medication intake. First case was a 54-year-old female taking ayurvedic medications since long time presented with acute confusional state and memory disturbances with abdominal pain. MRI brain showed symmetric basal ganglia and cortical signal changes and edema with significantly elevated lead levels in blood. She responded to chelation therapy with oral penicillamine with complete clinical and radiological resolution. Second case presented was a 45-year female taking ayurvedic medications for hypertension presented with headaches and rapid deterioration in sensorium leading to coma and death. MRI brain showed diffuse cerebral edema with basal ganglia signal changes with elevated lead levels in blood. These two cases highlight the need for increased awareness that some Ayurvedic medicines may contain potentially harmful levels of lead and people who use them are at risk of developing associated toxicity which can even be fatal.,"According to Acute Lead Encephalopathy Secondary to Ayurvedic Medication Use Two Cases with Review of Literature, long-term use of certain Ayurvedic medications can lead to serious health complications, including lead encephalopathy, due to the presence of lead in these medicines. Symptoms of this condition can include acute confusional state, memory disturbances, abdominal pain, headaches, and rapid deterioration in sensorium leading to coma and death. These complications may be resolved with chelation therapy using oral penicillamine. It is important to use Ayurvedic medicine under proper supervision to avoid such risks."
"How does your Ayurvedic prakriti type affect the type of bacteria in your gut, mouth, and skin","Ayurveda is one of the ancient systems of medicine which is widely practised as a personalized scientific approach towards the general wellness. Ayurvedic prakriti is broadly defined as the phenotypes which are determined on the basis of physical, psychological and physiological traits irrespective of their social, ethnic, dietary and geographical stature. Prakriti is the constitution of a person, which comprises vata, pitta, and kapha and is a key determinant of how one individual is different from the other. Human microbiome is considered the latest discovered human organ and microbiome research reiterates the fundamental principles of Ayurveda for creating a healthy gut environment by maintaining the individual-specific microbiome. Hence, it is important to understand the association of human microbiome with the Ayurvedic prakriti of an individual. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of human microbiome from the gut, oral and skin samples of healthy individuals n18 by 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomics using standard QIIME pipeline. In the three different prakriti samples differential abundance of Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio, Parabacteroides, Slackia, and Succinivibrio was observed in the gut microbiome. Analysis also revealed prakriti-specific presence of Mogibacterium, Propionibacterium, Pyramidobacter, Rhodococcus in the kapha prakriti individuals Planomicrobium, Hyphomicrobium, Novosphingobium in the pitta prakriti individuals and Carnobacterium, Robiginitalea, Cetobacterium, Psychrobacter in the vata prakriti individuals. Similarly, the oral and skin microbiome also revealed presence of prakriti-specific differential abundance of diverse bacterial genera. Prakriti-specific presence of bacterial taxa was recorded and only 42 microbiome in the oral samples and 52 microbiome in the skin samples were shared. Bacteria known for preventing gut inflammation by digesting the resistant starch were abundant in the pitta prakriti individuals, who are more prone to develop gut-inflammation-related disorders. In summary, human gut, oral and skin microbiome showed presence or high abundance of few bacterial taxa across three prakriti types, suggesting their specific physiological importance.","According to Understanding the association between the human gut, oral and skin microbiome and the Ayurvedic concept of prakriti, Ayurvedic prakriti, which includes vata, pitta, and kapha constitutions, is linked to the human microbiome and can influence individual health and wellbeing. The research revealed prakriti-specific presence of various bacteria in the gut, oral and skin microbiome. For example, Mogibacterium, Propionibacterium, Pyramidobacter, Rhodococcus were present in kapha prakriti individuals, Planomicrobium, Hyphomicrobium, Novosphingobium in pitta prakriti individuals and Carn"

What are some conditions where Ayurveda treatment is commonly used in Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka has had a pluralist health care system for centuries, in which Western biomedicine coexists with the Ayurveda system. However, recent studies suggest a declining trend in the use of the Ayurveda system. This study provides insights into the reasons for the low utilization of the Ayurveda system at present. The study findings reveal that low utilization of the Ayurveda system can be attributed to several factors, including the quick effect of Western medicines, the perception of being accustomed to Western medicines, a lack of competent Ayurveda practitioners, the high cost and low quality of Ayurveda medicines, and the rapidly changing lifestyles of villagers. However, for certain conditions such as fractures, snakebite, and paralysis, the majority of the Sri Lankan population still uses Ayurveda treatment. In conclusion, we suggest that health authorities should take into account these changes for future health planning in Sri Lanka.","According to Paradox in treatment seeking an experience from rural Sri Lanka, the Ayurvedic system is still used by the majority of the Sri Lankan population for treating certain conditions such as fractures, snakebite, and paralysis. However, the overall use of Ayurveda has seen a decline due to factors such as the quick effect of Western medicines, peoples familiarity with Western medicines, a shortage of skilled Ayurveda practitioners, the high cost and low quality of Ayurveda medicines, and rapidly changing lifestyles.

What are some health insights or practices we can learn from the ancient Hindu culture as described in the Sushruta Samhita,"Until the close of the eighteen century the western world remained ignorant of the ancient Hindu culture, in spite of early achievements found in the ancient Greek philosophy, in the Arabic translations and in the Italian Renassaince. The reason was that Hindu traditions were oraly transmitted and the records, written exclusively in Sanskrit, were incomplete. The European scholars and philogists evoked a late interest in Hindic studies, but for many years the dispute has been confined for scientific Medicine to a question of priority. By going through the Sucruta Samhita in the English translation of K. L. Bhishagratna one can afford to say that Sushruta has in many way not been a pupil of western culture but an original thinker.","According to research, The abstract does not provide specific information on Ayurvedic remedies."
How can I ensure the quality and authenticity of the herbal products I purchase,"INTRODUCTION Ayurveda takes advantage of the beneficial properties of medicinal plants. High demands in combination with inadequate availability of botanicals and a lack of knowledge with respect to their precise identification lead to adulterations in herbal products. Identification becomes more difficult in complex herbal formulations. Four different polyherbal formulations have been analyzed for the present paper. The targeted plants have different pharmacological properties for various ailments. OBJECTIVE We aimed to examine the rbcL gene based plant DNA mini-barcode to identify target and non-target plants in polyherbal formulations by using high-throughput next generation sequencing. METHODS Degenerate primers of the selected mini-barcode region have been identified from the literature. A blend of 30 authentic medicinal plant species was used to examine the species resolution capacity of the mini-barcode. DNA was isolated from herbal formulations, an amplicon library was prepared, and sequencing was performed on an IonS5 system. Data were analyzed using various bioinformatics tools. RESULTS Analysis of control pooled samples revealed the optimum resolving power of the DNA mini-barcode. Data analysis of the commercial samples revealed that only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed contents. In two formulations, only 10 out of 21 and 11 out of 20 plants were detected, respectively. Additionally, several non-listed plants were also detected in these formulations. Two formulations contained 20 reads assigned to non-target plants. Overall, 21.98 of the reads were assigned to non-target plants. CONCLUSION The present study clearly demonstrated the successful application and potential of meta-barcoding in the quality control of complex herbal matrices. The results strongly suggest that this approach can be used in pharmacovigilance of processed herbal products.","According to DNA meta-barcoding using rbcL based mini-barcode revealed presence of unspecified plant species in Ayurvedic polyherbal formulations, the researchers used a rbcL gene based plant DNA mini-barcode to identify target and non-target plants in four Ayurvedic polyherbal formulations. The analysis revealed that only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed contents. In two other formulations, only about half of the plants listed were detected, and several non-listed plants were also found. Two formulations contained more than 20 of non-target plants. This suggests that DNA meta-barcoding can be a useful tool in quality control and pharmacovigilance of processed herbal products to ensure they contain the correct medicinal"

"Can Ayurveda and Yoga be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for patients with other health conditions","BACKGROUND We report a high-risk case of a coronavirus disease 19 COVID-19-positive patient with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus DM, hypertension HTN, hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease CKD, treated successfully using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga, along with government-mandated compulsory modern western medicine MWM treatment. Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities, along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi, India, with confirmed tested COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN, hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever which was resolved by the time integrative therapy was started, sore throat, dry cough, body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based on the patients symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms within 2 days after starting the treatment he reported approximately Formula see text relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels both fasting blood sugar FBS and postprandial blood sugar PPBS exhibited significant improvement after 5 days, and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in symptoms, the patients real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR test done on the 19th day returned negative results. CONCLUSIONS Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a significant improvement in blood sugar levels not under control with modern medicine was also achieved. Integrative therapy based on the classical texts of Ayurveda and Yoga may offer a promising and scalable treatment option for COVID-19 patients. A case series or a suitably designed randomized controlled trial is needed to assess its efficacy.","According to The use of integrative therapy based on Yoga and Ayurveda in the treatment of a high-risk case of COVID-19SARS-CoV-2 with multiple comorbidities a case report, a COVID-19 positive patient with multiple health conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease was successfully treated using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga, along with standard western medicine.

What is Shilajit and how can it improve my quality of life,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Shilajit is a multi-component natural occurring mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine which originated in India. Its source can be traced to the mountainous regions, where the hilly tribes first identified its beneficial use. Shilajit is aptly referred to as rasayanarasayanam in Ayurveda and Siddha literature which means rejuvenator because it prevents ailment and enhances the quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS An attempt has been put forth to review shilajit pertaining to its origin, synonyms, varieties, physical properties, chemical constituents, therapeutic properties and important biological properties to affirm its rasayana property. All relevant information on shilajit was collected from classical texts including pharmacopoeias, formularies, etc. Moreover, select doctoral thesis from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar were also scanned. Published papers on shilajit were collected from important databases for biomedical sciences. Amongst, the various biological properties of shilajit, antioxidant activity and immuno-modulatory activity were focused as it is closely related to its rasayana potential. RESULTS This review finds that shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations and twenty-four proprietary drugs for extraneous indications. Even-though, there is a long history of use of shilajit in traditional Indian materia medica, shilajit unfortunately lacks scientific evaluation and systematic documentation. In vivo antioxidant activity of shilajit has been studied at an irrelevant dose and without using a positive control. The immuno-modulatory activity does not stand the test of critical assessment and currently may be considered as unproven. CONCLUSION Based on the earlier studies, the bioactivity of shilajit lacks substantial evidence. Nevertheless, further studies are imperative to overcome the lacuna in establishing the antioxidant property of shilajit and more specific assays are needed to vouch shilajit as an immuno-modulator which may be of use to establish its rasayana potential.","According to Review on shilajit used in traditional Indian medicine, Shilajit is a natural mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine, originating from mountainous regions in India.

Shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations and twenty-four proprietary drugs. However, the paper also notes that the bioactivity of shilajit lacks substantial evidence and more research is needed to confirm its properties as an antioxidant and immuno-modulator."
Can the Ayurvedic medicine Mucuna pruriens help slow down the progression of Parkinsons disease,"Immune control is associated with nigrostriatal neuroprotection for Parkinsons disease PD though its direct cause and effect relationships have not yet been realized and modulating the immune system for therapeutic gain has been openly discussed. While the pathobiology of PD remains in study, neuroinflammation is thought to speed nigrostriatal degeneration. The neuroinflammatory cascade associated with PD begins with aggregation of misfolded or post-translationally modified -synuclein -syn. Such aggregation results in neuronal cell death and the presence of chronically activated glia microglia and astroglia, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-, interleukin-1 beta IL-1, IL-6, and enzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2. These changes in the glial phenotype can affect the central nervous system CNS microenvironment by producing a pro-inflammatory milieu that speeds PD pathogenesis. Mucuna pruriens Mp is the most popular drug in Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine. Several reports have suggested that it possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-epileptic and anti-microbial activities. Mp contain L-DOPA and ursolic acid which has an anti-inflammatory property. There are very few literatures which show the immunomodulatory activity of Mp in PD, several researchers have tried to work on the immunomodulatory activity of Mp in some other diseases. The results of several studies show that Mp modulate the immune components like TNF-, IL-6, IFN-, IL-1, iNOS and IL-2 in the CNS. It also modulates the activity of the transcription factor NF-kB which plays an important role in the progression of the PD. Thus, by altering these cytokines or transcription factors, Mp protects or prevents the progression of PD. Thus in this review we try to explore the immunomodulatory activity of Mp in PD.","According to Immunomodulation of Parkinsons disease using Mucuna pruriens Mp, Mucuna pruriens Mp is a popular drug in Ayurveda that is reported to have immunomodulatory activity in Parkinsons Disease PD.

How has Ayurveda in Kerala managed to maintain its traditional methods in the face of modern pharmaceutical practices,"Ethnographic inquiry into Ayurvedic commodification in Kerala revealed the prevalence of a distinct regional pharmaceutical market dominated by physician-manufacturers, oriented towards supplying classical medicines to Ayurvedic doctors. This stands in sharp contrast to mainstream Ayurveda that is observed to have undergone biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization. This paper argues that Keralas classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market constitutes an alternative modernity because it provided Kerala Ayurveda with a different route to modernization impervious to the biomedical regime, as well as endowing it with the institutional power to safeguard its regional identity. Although physician-entrepreneurs are its key architects, it is sustained by value regimes shaped by a unique regional medico-cultural milieu. Even when industrially produced, classical medicines remain embedded within Ayurvedas socio-technical network unlike proprietary drugs sold as individual product-identities through non-Ayurvedic channels, they travel together as a pharmacopeia, distributed through exclusive doctor-mediated agencies. This clinic-centric distribution format is best conceptualized as an open-source business model as it made low-margin generics viable by packaging them with therapies and services. Besides ensuring better access and affordability, it provided resistance to pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property concentration. By keeping the doctor in the loop, it prevented medicines from degenerating into de-contextualized commodities the service component of Ayurveda therein preserved went on become the unique selling point in the health-tourism market. The tourism-inspired proliferation of Brand Kerala eventually triggered a paradigm shift in mainstream Ayurveda - shifting focus from pharmaceuticals to services and from illness to wellness. Furthermore, interacting with hybrid Ayurvedas in transnational markets, Kerala Ayurveda co-produces new alterities countervailing the structurally dominant biomedical paradigm.","According to Keeping the doctor in the loop Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals in Kerala, Ayurvedic commodification in Kerala has led to a distinct regional pharmaceutical market that is dominated by physician-manufacturers who supply classical medicines to Ayurvedic doctors.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for secondary infertility,"OBJECTIVES Secondary Infertility is a major concern worldwide, accounting for about 40 of female infertility due to lifestyle factor. Secondary Infertility is having a close proximity to a disorder Vandhyatwa explained in Ayurvedic classics, due to a variety of causes. Several Ayurvedic interventions are advised such as Panchakarma purification therapy for vitiated Doshas in female reproductive organs, Snehapana oral intake of medicated oil followed by Virechana purgation to produce quality ovum. Other internal medications like Phalaghrita, Ashokarishta, Kanchanara guggulu etc. have a probable mode of action with enhancing the perceptibility of endometrium for implantation.

What are the health benefits of Shatavari and how can I be sure Im purchasing a genuine product,"Shatavari-a famous Ayurveda materia medica used mainly as a tonic for women-is distributed in health food products all over the world. The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India identifies the botanical origin of shatavari as the tuberous root of Asparagus racemosus. We recently investigated by DNA analysis the botanical origin of shatavari products on the Japanese market. The results suggested that their botanical origin was Asparagus however, species identification was difficult. In this study, we analyzed steroidal saponins, including those specific to this plant, in these products and confirmed their origin as A. racemosus. Next, alkaloid analyses of an authentic A. racemosus plant and these products were performed, because several papers have reported the isolation of a pyrrolo1,2-aazepine alkaloid, asparagamine A, from this plant. Our results suggest that neither plant material nor products contained asparagamine A. It has been pointed out that Stemona plants are sometimes mistaken for shatavari, because their tuberous roots have a similar shape to that of A. racemosus, and pyrrolo1,2-aazepine alkaloids are thought to be Stemona-specific. These data strongly suggest that A. racemosus does not contain asparagamine A, and that previous isolation of asparagamine A from materials claimed as originating from A. racemosus was likely caused by misidentification of Stemona plants as A. racemosus.","According to Chemical analysis reveals the botanical origin of shatavari products and confirms the absence of alkaloid asparagamine A in Asparagus racemosus, shatavari is identified as the tuberous root of Asparagus racemosus in Ayurvedic medicine and is often distributed in health food products worldwide.

The drug suppressed various experimentally induced inflammatory reactions and did not show any gastric irritation in antiinflammatory doses. It is suggested that it may partially mediate its antiinflammatory activity by interfering with the action andor synthesis of prostaglandins and also perhaps by stabilization of the lysosomal membranes. Its antiinflammatory activity is comparable to that of indomethacin.","According to Antiinflammatory effects of an Ayurvedic preparation, Brahmi Rasayan, in rodents, Brahmi Rasayan is an Ayurvedic remedy that has shown antiinflammatory effects in rodents.

"How does ones religious beliefs influence their choice of healthcare, such as Ayurvedic or allopathic medicine","In-depth interviews and participant observation was conducted with 14 Hindu religious renunciates, 70 years or older. Despite having taken vows renouncing concern for physical pain or comfort, respondents differed markedly in their attitudes toward pain and their rationale for utilizing medical treatment. They differed still further in their use of Ayurvedic and allopathic medicine, with the most culturally conservative accepting only Ayurvedic medicine. Rejection of allopathic medicine tended to be associated with a highly systematized religious world-view. The results are discussed in terms of both the ideological conflict between religious world-view and medical usage, and the need for sophisticated distinction of religious world-view if research on the religious factor of health care utilization is to prove fruitful.","According to Identity, ideology and medicine health attitudes and behavior among Hindu religious renunciates, the most culturally conservative Hindu religious renunciates accepted only Ayurvedic medicine. Their rejection of allopathic medicine was linked to a highly systematized religious world-view. No specific Ayurvedic remedies are mentioned in the abstract."
What are some alternative or traditional treatment methods for psoriasis,"BACKGROUND Psoriasis is a genetically predisposed autoimmune disease mediated by cytokines released by the activated immune cells. It manifests inflammatory, scaly red or white silvery flaky skin which may be a fluid-filled lesion with soreness and itchiness. The prevalence rate of psoriasis is increasing day by day. Despite having such a high prevalence rate, the treatment of psoriasis is still limited. Hence, there is a need to rethink the various treatment strategies available in the allopathic as well as in the alternative systems of medicine. METHODS Various bibliographic databases of previously published peer-reviewed research papers were explored and systematic data culminated in terms of various treatment strategies used for the management of psoriasis. The prime focus is given towards modern as well as alternative systems of medicine such as phototherapy, a combination of phototherapy with pharmacotherapy such as Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy to treat psoriasis. RESULTS A comprehensive review of 161 papers, including both research and review articles, was carried out to make the article readily understandable. The pathogenesis including inflammatory mediators and type of psoriasis is discussed before the treatment strategies to understand the pathophysiology of the disease. The uniqueness, procedure, advantages, and limitations of conventional, advanced, and traditional systems of medicine to treat psoriasis are discussed in detail. Emphasis has also been given towards marine sources such as fish oil, marine sponges, and algae. CONCLUSION Although there are many modern and alternative treatment strategies available to treat psoriasis, none of them have been proven to provide complete relief to patients. Moreover, they are associated with certain side effects. In order to overcome them, novel drug delivery systems have been utilized and found effective however, their stability and safety become the major impediments towards their successful positioning. Traditional and alternative treatment strategies have found to be safe and effective but their use is localized to certain areas. In a nutshell, to achieve successful treatment of psoriasis, there is a need to focus on the development of stable and non-toxic novel drug delivery systems or the promotion of traditional systems to treat psoriasis.","According to Treatment Strategies Against Psoriasis Principle, Perspectives and Practices, a combination of phototherapy with Ayurvedic remedies, Yoga, and naturopathy, as well as Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy treatments, are alternative strategies used in the management of psoriasis.

Is there a way to verify the authenticity of Ayurvedic herbal supplements I purchase for respiratory symptoms,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased global use of traditional medicines, including Ayurvedic herbal preparations. Due to their growing demand, their processed nature, and the complexity of the global supply chain, there is an increased risk of adulteration in these products. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to assess the use of DNA barcoding for species identification in herbal supplements on the US market associated with the Ayurvedic treatment of respiratory symptoms. METHODS A total of 54 commercial products containing Ayurvedic herbs were tested with four DNA barcoding regions i.e., rbcL, matK, ITS2, and mini-ITS2 using two composite samples per product. Nine categories of herbs were targeted amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and vacha. RESULTS At least one species was identified in 64.8 of products and the expected species was detected in 38.9 of products. Undeclared plant species, including other Ayurvedic herbs, rice, and pepper, were detected in 19 products, and fungal species were identified in 12 products. The presence of undeclared plant species may be a result of intentional substitution or contamination during harvest or processing, while fungal DNA was likely associated with the plant material or the growing environment. The greatest sequencing success 42.6-46.3 was obtained with the matK and rbcL primers. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that a combination of genetic loci should be used for DNA barcoding of herbal supplements. Due to the limitations of DNA barcoding in identification of these products, future research should incorporate chemical characterization techniques.","According to DNA barcoding of herbal supplements on the US commercial market associated with the purported treatment of COVID-19, the Ayurvedic herbs used in the treatment of respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 include amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and vacha.

What are some local health traditions in southern India that can contribute to wellness,"Medicine and healing have been critical elements of nation-building and governance in India. There is a clear hierarchy biomedicine, followed by systems like Ayurveda which are to be mainstreamed, and local health traditions, which are to be revitalised. Mindful that power nonetheless resides in positions of marginality, this analysis drew from a health system ethnography on revitalisation of local health traditions in three southern Indian states. Data from multiple interviews with 51 healers, observations of meetings, healing sessions and events convened by healers, as well as a multi-stakeholder dialogue on local health traditions convened by authors were analysed using a grounded analytical process. The state was a source of power, but in an enmeshed, individualised form. Other sources of power included accomplished others who viewed healers and their practices with respect, healers collectives that produced and reinforced power through the exercise of certain rituals, and the sacred calling to heal, which assumed stringent criteria for practice and training, while also creating a moral imperative for service orientation. Our study shows how power rests in or is derived from multiple sites and sources that inhere and interact in critical ways with the state and other systems of medicine.","According to research, The research paper titled A light inside a pot Sites and sources of power emerging from an ethnography of traditional healing in South India doesnt provide specific Ayurvedic remedies. However, it mentions the revitalization of local health traditions in South India, which includes Ayurveda.

The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor Francis. RESULTS After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

What are the benefits of Brahmi in Ayurvedic medicine for improving memory and reducing stress,"Bacopa monniera, Linn. Brahmi Scrophulariaceae an Ayurvedic medicine is clinically used for memory enhancing, epilepsy, insomnia and as mild sedative. For the first time the effect of alcohol and hexane fraction of Brahmi has been studied on FeSO4 and cumene hydroperoxide induced lipid peroxidation. Alcohol fraction showed greater protection with both inducers. Results were compared with known antioxidants tris, EDTA and a natural-antioxidant vitamin E. The effect of Brahmi was also examined on hepatic glutathione content. The mechanism of action could be through metal chelation at the initiation level and also as chain breaker. The results suggested that Brahmi is a potent antioxidant. The response of Brahmi was dose dependent. Tris, an hydroxyl trapper did not show any protection in comparison to Brahmi where as EDTA and vitamin E did protect against FeSO4. In experimental conditions 100 micrograms Brahmi extract alcoholic was equivalent to 247 micrograms of EDTA 0.66 microM and 58 micrograms of vitamin E. Interestingly Brahmi only slightly protected the autooxidation and FeSO4 induced oxidation of reduced glutathione on lower doses 100 microgramsml and below, but on higher concentrations it enhanced the rate of oxidation.","According to Bacopa monniera Linn. as an antioxidant mechanism of action, Brahmi Bacopa monniera, Linn. is a clinically used Ayurvedic medicine for enhancing memory, treating epilepsy, insomnia, and acting as a mild sedative.

How might Ayurvedic treatments help manage stress and anxiety related to physical health conditions,"BACKGROUND Good mental condition is a vital part of health. Physical impairments would potentially have psychiatric manifestations during the course of a disease that could cause patients to experience a wide range of psychological conditions. This study was conducted to determine prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological morbidities among the patients who received warded treatments at Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. METHODS A total of 148 patients admitted to the hospital were selected for the study on a random systematic basis under four systemic groups gastrointestinal, integumentary, musculoskeletal, and nervous system depending on the chief complaint. The presence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms was assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 item version DASS 21. The General Linear Model GLM was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Over 50 of the participants in all four patient groups belonged to age group of 35 to 65 years, encompassing the fraction of population that actively contribute to the workforce in the society. Stress, anxiety, and depression values of patients belonging to different complications varied significantly, as indicated by GLM p 0.05. Patients diagnosed with integumentary system-related issues denoted the highest stress levels 27.7 2.54, while the mean stress values among the other systemic groups were not significantly different among each other. The highest anxiety levels were indicated by patients with nervous system-related issues 18.6 1.51, while the lowest anxiety levels were indicated by patients with integumentary disorders 6.0 2.73. The highest depression level was identified from patients suffering from integumentary system-related disorders 31.7 3.42, followed by nervous system 23.2 1.78, gastrointestinal 19.5 3.77, and musculoskeletal 16.8 1.57 disorders. CONCLUSION Overall, high distress levels were observed among the majority of the patients. Furthermore, integumentary issues may lead to significant psychological impacts. As most of the patients seek for Ayurveda treatments when their diseased condition becomes chronic, it is vital to focus on a biopsychosocial approach to patient assessment and patient care, in actual practice.","According to Assessment of Anxiety, Depression, Stress, and Associated Psychological Morbidities among Patients Receiving Ayurvedic Treatment for Different Health Issues First Study from Sri Lanka, the majority of patients receiving Ayurvedic treatments experience high levels of distress.

How can I ensure that the Ayurvedic medicinal plants I purchase are authentic and not adulterated,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that originated in ancient India, and it is still in practice. Medicinal plants are the backbone of Ayurveda, which heavily relies on the plant-derived therapeutics. While Ayurveda is becoming more popular in several countries throughout the World, lack of authenticated medicinal plant raw drugs is a growing concern. Our aim was to DNA barcode the medicinal plants that are listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India API to create a reference DNA barcode library, and to use the same to authenticate the raw drugs that are sold in markets. METHODS We have DNA barcoded 347 medicinal plants using rbcL marker, and curated rbcL DNA barcodes for 27 medicinal plants from public databases. These sequences were used to create Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA Barcode Library API-RDBL. This library was used to authenticate 100 medicinal plant raw drugs, which were in the form of powders 82 and seeds 18. RESULTS Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA Barcode Library API-RDBL was created with high quality and authentic rbcL barcodes for 374 out of the 395 medicinal plants that are included in the API. The rbcL DNA barcode differentiated 319 species 85 with the pairwise divergence ranging between 0.2 and 29.9 . PCR amplification and DNA sequencing success rate of rbcL marker was 100 even for the poorly preserved medicinal plant raw drugs that were collected from local markets. DNA barcoding revealed that only 79 raw drugs were authentic, and the remaining 21 samples were adulterated. Further, adulteration was found to be much higher with powders ca. 25 when compared to seeds ca. 5 . CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated the utility of DNA barcoding in authenticating medicinal plant raw drugs, and found that approximately one fifth of the market samples were adulterated. Powdered raw drugs, which are very difficult to be identified by taxonomists as well as common people, seem to be the easy target for adulteration. Developing a quality control protocol for medicinal plant raw drugs by incorporating DNA barcoding as a component is essential to ensure safety to the consumers.","According to Creation of reference DNA barcode library and authentication of medicinal plant raw drugs used in Ayurvedic medicine, the researchers created a reference DNA barcode library API-RDBL for 374 out of 395 medicinal plants listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India API using the rbcL marker.

How can Ayurvedic medicine be effectively integrated into traditional healthcare practices in Bangladesh,"The World Health Organization WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 aimed to help member states promote the safe and effective use of traditional medicine. While economic conditions have markedly improved in Bangladesh, the country is experiencing significant public health problems. Because of limited medical resources, there is a strong incentive to enhance complementary and alternative medicine usage in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to confirm the perceptions and attitudes of medical doctors MDs in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with regard to Ayurvedic medicine AM. A total number of 159 MDs in Dhaka were interviewed by face-to-face between February and June 2015. The study revealed that 62.0 of MDs had treated patients with AM and 55.3 believed that AM should be regarded as its own specialty, whereas 39.7 of MDs believed that AM should be part of the conventional medical curriculum and 32.7 thought that AM did not seem scientific. In terms of gender, 45.3 of male MDs agreed or strongly agreed that AM only had a placebo effect. On the other hand, 65.8 of female MDs disagreed or strongly disagreed it. In terms of age, 77.0 of MDs aged 36 or elder elder MDs believed they were more likely to recommend AM use and 80.3 of elder MDs believed that the government should encourage more initiatives to promote AM. To enhance AM use, scientifically robust information on the efficacy, safety and scientific basis of AM should be more effectively conveyed to male MDs.","According to Perception and attitude of medical doctors in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with regard to Ayurvedic medicine, a study found that 62.0 of the medical doctors surveyed in Dhaka had treated patients with Ayurvedic Medicine and 55.3 believed that Ayurvedic Medicine should be regarded as its own specialty.

What Ayurvedic treatments could potentially help manage diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus is a condition that is extremely serious from both clinical and public health standpoints. The traditional healthcare system of India, Ayurveda, offers a balanced and holistic multi-modality approach to treating this disorder. Many Ayurvedic modalities have been subjected to empirical scientific evaluation, but most such research has been done in India, receiving little attention in North America. This paper offers a review of the English language literature related to Ayurveda and diabetes care, encompassing herbs, diet, yoga, and meditation as modalities that are accessible and acceptable to Western clinicians and patients. There is a considerable amount of data from both animal and human trials suggesting efficacy of Ayurvedic interventions in managing diabetes. However, the reported human trials generally fall short of contemporary methodological standards. More research is needed in the area of Ayurvedic treatment of diabetes, assessing both whole practice and individual modalities.","According to Ayurveda for diabetes mellitus a review of the biomedical literature, Ayurveda, the traditional healthcare system of India, provides a holistic approach to treating diabetes that includes the use of herbs, diet control, yoga, and meditation.

Can Ashwagandha help improve muscle function and repair,"Withania somnifera Ashwagandha is used in Indian traditional medicine, Ayurveda, and is believed to have a variety of health-promoting effects. The molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying these effects have not yet been sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of Ashwagandha extracts and their major withanolides withaferin A and withanone on muscle cell differentiation using C2C12 myoblasts. We found that withaferin A and withanone and Ashwagandha extracts possessing different ratios of these active ingredients have different effects on the differentiation of C2C12. Withanone and withanone-rich extracts caused stronger differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, deaggregation of heat- and metal-stress-induced aggregated proteins, and activation of hypoxia and autophagy pathways. Of note, the Parkinsons disease model of Drosophila that possess a neuromuscular disorder showed improvement in their flight and climbing activity, suggesting the potential of Ashwagandha withanolides for the management of muscle repair and activity.","According to Effect of Ashwagandha Withanolides on Muscle Cell Differentiation, Ashwagandha Withania somnifera extracts and two of their active ingredients, withaferin A and withanone, have varying effects on muscle cell differentiation.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for asthma and heart disease,"INTRODUCTION A number of traditional systems of medicine exist in India of which Ayurveda is the most popular. Despite being in use for more than 3000 years, few properly designed trials have scientifically examined the clinical potential of Ayurvedic and other medications. METHODS We reviewed the MEDLINE database to identify clinical trials conducted using traditional Indian medicines. Single case reports were excluded. RESULTS Ayurvedic preparations have been successfully used for the treatment of bronchial asthma, ischaemic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia. Formulations containing curcumin were reported to reduce inflammation and disability in double-blind clinical trials on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A number of products are reported to be useful in patients with acute viral hepatitis. A multicentric study by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed that a preparation from Pterocarpus marsupium was effective in reducing levels of blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In another multicentric trial, patients with fistula-in-ano were randomised to surgery or application of medicated seton Ksharsootra. Surgical treatment led to a faster cure but recurrence rates were lower with medicated seton. Administration of extract from Bacopa monnieri, to children with mental retardation, was reported to significantly improve short-term and long-term memory. CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based studies on the efficacy and safety of traditional Indian medicines are limited. The essential ingredient in most formulations is not precisely defined. High quality studies are necessary to evaluate and compare the value of traditional Indian drugs to modern medicine.","According to Traditional Indian systems of medicine, Ayurvedic remedies have been reported to be effective in treating several conditions.

How can Ayurvedic medicine support traditional cancer treatments,"OBJECTIVE To characterize Ayurvedic perspectives on the etiopathogenesis and supportive treatments for a biomedical diagnosis of cancer. METHODS Hour-long, digitally recorded interviews were conducted with 10 experienced Ayurvedic clinicians, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using techniques of qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS Four major themes were identified. The Ayurvedic description of the pathophysiology of cancer uses traditional concepts translated into a modern context. Although the biomedical treatment of cancer is considered valuable, from an Ayurvedic perspective it results in degeneration and depletion. In cases where biomedical treatment of cancer is not feasible, an Ayurvedic approach focusing on strengthening digestion, eliminating toxins, reducing tumor growth, and improving tissue metabolism is useful. An Ayurvedic approach to cancer supportive care focuses on restoring equilibrium, building strength, and rejuvenation. CONCLUSION Ayurvedic medicine offers a unique perspective on the biomedical diagnosis of cancer that emphasizes restoring wholeness, uses natural remedies, includes a focus on emotional health, and emphasizes prevention strategies.","According to Correlating traditional Ayurvedic and modern medical perspectives on cancer results of a qualitative study, Ayurvedic medicine offers a distinctive approach to cancer treatment.

How can the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatments be more accurately tested in clinical studies,"OBJECTIVES The objective of this literature review is to evaluate whether Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria or Western medicine diagnostic criteria have been used in published clinical trials testing an Ayurvedic interventiontreatment. DESIGN The PubMed, Embase, and Allied and Complementary Medicine databases were searched to identify Ayurvedic clinical trials published from 1980 to 2009. A total of 45 Ayurvedic clinical trials were identified and grouped into two time periods pre- and post-2000 periods. Each article was independently reviewed by two calibrated reviewers. RESULTS Analysis revealed that not 1 of these 45 studies, in either time period, reported only-and-full use of the 23 available Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria. In fact, 24.4 of these 45 articles never specified any diagnostic criteria at all. While the percentage of articles using Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria either as only use or combined use with Western Medicine diagnostic criteria doubled over the two time periods 27.7 to 59, rarely were more than 2 of the 23 Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria ever used. CONCLUSIONS To improve confidence in their findings, future studies should strive to correct this observed inappropriate and gross underuse of Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria in the designing of clinical studies that aim to rigorously test the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatments.","According to Use of Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria in Ayurvedic clinical trials a literature review focused on research methods, the research found that Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria were underused in clinical trials testing Ayurvedic treatments.

Can Ayurvedic medicine be effective in treating symptoms of schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems since 1000 BC. OBJECTIVES To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register March 2007 and AMED March 2007, inspected references of all identified studies and contacted the first author of each included study. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all clinical randomised trials comparing Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently extracted data and calculated random effects, relative risk RR, 95 confidence intervals CI and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treatharm NNTH on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences WMD. MAIN RESULTS From the three small total n250 short included studies, we were unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic herbs were compared with placebo, about 20 of people left the studies early n120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62. Mental state ratings were mostly equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic assessment n68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to 12. Behaviour seemed unchanged n43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating 1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91. Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga group n43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30. When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared with antipsychotic drugs chlorpromazine, again, equal numbers left the study early n120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97 but people allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared to those allocated chlorpromazine n45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98. Again, nausea and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga n45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09 to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38. Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill people with schizophrenia, it is equally 10 attrition, n36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13 to 3.53, but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group. AUTHORS CONCLUSIONS Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials.","According to Ayurvedic medicine for schizophrenia, Ayurvedic herbs, specifically a treatment called brahmyadiyoga, have been evaluated in treatment of schizophrenia. However, these were only small studies and results were largely inconclusive. While some improvement was noted in mental state ratings when Ayurvedic assessment was used, there was no change in behaviour observed. Common side effects included nausea and vomiting. When compared with antipsychotic drugs like chlorpromazine, equal numbers left the study early and those allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state. The authors conclude that Ayurvedic remedies may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but they have only been evaluated in a few small trials."

Can Ayurvedic principles like prakriti help in personalizing treatments for various illnesses,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine describes a unique concept prakriti, genetically determined, categorising the population into several subgroups based on phenotypic characters like appearance, temperament and habits. The concept is claimed to be useful in predicting an individuals susceptibility to a particular disease, prognosis of that illness and selection of therapy. The present study was carried out to study if the platelet aggregatory response and its inhibition by aspirin varied in the different prakriti subtypes. METHODS After obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee permission, normal healthy individuals of either sex between the age group 18 to 30 years were recruited in the study. Their prakriti evaluation was done using a standardized validated questionnaire TNMC Prakriti 2004. Their Platelet Rich Plasma was incubated with either aspirin 2.5 micro-mole M and 5 M or distilled water as control for three minutes after which the aggregatory response to 5 M Adenosine Diphosphate ADP was measured over a period of 7 minutes. RESULTS We observed that in the study population of normal healthy participants n 137, ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation MPA was highest among the Vata-pitta prakriti individuals Median range, 83.33 52.33-96 as compared to the other prakriti types and these individuals responded better to lower dose of aspirin compared to other prakriti types. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that identifying the prakriti may help in individualising therapy or predicting proneness to a disease.","According to Prakriti Ayurvedic concept of constitution and variations in platelet aggregation, the Ayurvedic concept of prakriti or constitution could be useful in individualizing treatment, particularly with respect to the use of aspirin. The study found that individuals with Vata-pitta prakriti showed the highest levels of ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation and responded better to lower doses of aspirin compared to other prakriti types. This suggests that understanding a patients prakriti could help predict their proneness to certain diseases and tailor their therapy accordingly."

"Are herbal medicines safe for treating liver diseases, considering the potential for residual solvents","Background Herbal medicines have been used in the treatment of liver diseases for a long time. In recent years, the use of herbal medicines for protection from other strong antibiotics as well as drugs that can damage the liver during their metabolism in liver and for treatment of liver diseases has increased all over the world. It is important to mention that a number of organic solvents are used at different stages of extractionformulation development for these traditional preparations in industriespharmacies. In addition, some of these solvents possess established carcinogenic properties and may enter the formulation as residual solvents. Hence as per ICH guidelines it is mandatory to keep the level of these solvents up to permissible limits. There has been a lot of hue and cry that ayurvedic formulations available in the market are not properly standardized for their quality due to lack of stringent regulations and standards from regulatory authorities. Therefore the aim of present work was to assess the compliance of ICH guidelines for level of organic volatile impurities in common marketed ayurvedic hepatic formulations. Methods In this study, 25 ayurvedic herbal formulations available as OTC product have been assessed for presence of residual solvents using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector. Results This study on 25 fast moving hepatic formulations in the market reflects that no residual solvents were detected in any of the formulations however if present were within prescribed permissible limits of ICH guidelines. The data was also subjected to statistical analysis F-test and t-test at 95 confidence level. Conclusions Results indicate the safety of these hepatic formulations with respect to residual solvents. In addition presents a simple, linear, specific, accurate, precise and rugged gas chromatographic method for estimation of residual solvents.","According to Assessment of compliance level of ICH guidelines for organic volatile impurities in common ayurvedic hepatic formulations, the study assessed the compliance of 25 over-the-counter Ayurvedic herbal formulations for liver diseases with the ICH guidelines for organic volatile impurities.

This indicates the safety of these Ayurvedic liver formulations with respect to residual solvents."
What are some ways to manage skin conditions like psoriasis and vitiligo through practices like meditation and exercise,"Psychodermatology, a relatively neglected branch of dermatology in India, refers to a holistic approach to skin diseases involving not only the mind and skin, but also the cutaneous effects of psychologic stress. Among many Indian people, culture, religion, the belief in karma, and the tendency to prefer indigenous medical systems can all have a major impact on lifestyle, as well as the approach to managing various diseases, including dermatologic conditions. The origin of psychodermatology in India can be traced to Buddhas period. Indigenous medical systems, such as Ayurveda, Yoga, and Unani, advocate control of skin disease through meditation, exercises, and related practices. Scientific practice of psychodermatology is still lacking in India, although there is an increasing understanding of the mind-skin connection among both health care providers and patients who have access to information over the Internet. The first dedicated psychodermatology liaison clinic was established in 2010 in Manipal, India. The common problems encountered have been anxiety, dysthymia, and depression, especially in patients with psoriasis, vitiligo, and urticaria.","According to Psychodermatology An Indian perspective, the key Ayurvedic remedies for managing skin diseases include meditation, exercises, and related practices.

Can taking Chyawanprash regularly improve my overall health and immunity,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Chyawanprash CP, a traditional immune booster recipe, has a long history of ethnic origin, development, household preparation and usage. There are even mythological stories about the origin of this recipe including its nomenclature. In the last six decades, CP, because of entrepreneurial actions of some research Vaidyas traditional doctors has grown to industrial production and marketing in packed forms to a large number of consumerspatients like any food or health care product. Currently, CP has acquired a large accepted user base in India and in a few countries out-side India. AIM OF THE STUDY Authoritative texts, recognized by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of India, describe CP as an immunity enhancer and strength giver meant for improving lung functions in diseases with compromised immunity. This review focuses on published clinical efficacy and safety studies of CP for correlation with health benefits as documented in the authoritative texts, and also briefs on its recipes and processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Authoritative texts were searched for recipes, processes, and other technical details of CP. Labels of marketing CP products Indian were studied for the health claims. Electronic search for studies of CP on efficacy and safety data were performed in PubMedMEDLINE and DHARA Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles, and Ayurvedic books were also searched for clinical studies. RESULTS The documented clinical studies from electronic databases and Ayurvedic books evidenced that individuals who consume CP regularly for a definite period of time showed improvement in overall health status and immunity. However, most of the clinical studies in this review are of smaller sample size and short duration. Further, limitation to access and review significant data on traditional products like CP in electronic databases was noted. CONCLUSIONS Randomized controlled trials of high quality with larger sample size and longer follow-up are needed to have significant evidence on the clinical use of CP as immunity booster.

What are some of the benefits of using the herb Ashwagandha in Ayurvedic medicine,"Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word, which means the scripture for longevity. It represents an ancient system of traditional medicine prevalent in India and in several other south Asian countries. It is based on a holistic view of treatment which is believed to cure human diseases through establishment of equilibrium in the different elements of human life, the body, the mind, the intellect and the soul 1. Ayurveda dates back to the period of the Indus Valley civilization about 3000 B.C and has been passed on through generations of oral tradition, like the other four sacred texts Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvanaveda which were composed between 12th and 7th century B.C 2, 3. References to the herbal medicines of Ayurveda are found in all of the other four Vedas, suggesting that Ayurveda predates the other Vedas by at least several centuries. It was already in full practice at the time of Buddha 6th century B.C and had produced two of the greatest physicians of ancient India, Charaka and Shushrutha who composed the basic texts of their trade, the Samhitas. By this time, ayurveda had already developed eight different subspecialties of medical treatment, named Ashtanga, which included surgery, internal medicine, ENT, pediatrics, toxicology, health and longevity, and spiritual healing 4. Ayurvedic medicine was mainly composed of herbal preparations which were occasionally combined with different levels of other compounds, as supplements 5. In the Ayurvedic system, the herbs used for medicinal purposes are classed as brain tonics or rejuvenators. Among the plants most often used in Ayurveda are, in the descending order of importance a Ashwagandha, b Brahmi, c Jatamansi, d Jyotishmati, e Mandukparni, f Shankhapushpi, and g Vacha. The general appearance of these seven plants is shown in Fig.1. Their corresponding Latin names, as employed in current scientific literature, the botanical families that each of them belongs to, their normal habitats in different areas of the world, as well as the common synonyms by which they are known, are shown in the Table 1. The scientific investigations concerning the best known and most scientifically investigated of these herbs, Ashwagandha will be discussed in detail in this review. Ashwagandha Withania somnifera, WS, also commonly known, in different parts of the world, as Indian ginseng, Winter cherry, Ajagandha, Kanaje Hindi and Samm Al Ferakh, is a plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is also known in different linguistic areas in India by its local vernacular names 6. It grows prolifically in dry regions of South Asia, Central Asia and Africa, particularly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Congo and Jordon 7. In India, it is cultivated, on a commercial scale, in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan 6. In Sanskrit, ashwagandha, the Indian name for WS, means odor of the horse, probably originating from the odor of its root which resembles that of a sweaty horse. The namesomnifera in Latin means sleep-inducer which probably refers to its extensive use as a remedy against stress from a variety of daily chores. Some herbalists refer to ashwagandha as Indian ginseng, since it is used in India, in a way similar to how ginseng is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a large variety of human diseases 8. Ashwagandha is a shrub whose various parts berries, leaves and roots have been used by Ayurvedic practitioners as folk remedies, or as aphrodisiacs and diuretics. The fresh roots are sometimes boiled in milk, in order to leach out undesirable constituents. The berries are sometimes used as a substitute to coagulate milk in cheese making. In Ayurveda, the herbal preparation is referred to as a rasayana, an elixir that works, in a nonspecific, global fashion, to increase human health and longevity. It is also considered an adaptogen, a nontoxic medication that normalizes physiological functions, disturbed by chronic stress, through correction of imbalances in the neuroendocrine and immune systems 9, 10. The scientific research that has been carried out on Ashwagandha and other ayurvedic herbal medicines may be classified into three major categories, taking into consideration the endogenous or exogenous phenomena that are known to cause physiological disequilibrium leading to the pathological state A pharmacological and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or multi-herbal mixtures on specific non-neurological diseases B pharmacological and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or multi-herbal mixtures on neurodegenerative disorders and C biochemical, physiological and genetic studies on the herbal plants themselves, in order to distinguish between those originating from different habitats, or to improve the known medicinal quality of the indigenous plant. Some of the major points on its use in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders are described below.","According to Scientific basis for the use of Indian ayurvedic medicinal plants in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders ashwagandha, Ayurvedic medicine primarily uses herbal preparations, occasionally combined with different levels of other compounds, as supplements.

What can I do to ensure that the Ashwagandha I buy is authentic and not adulterated,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng, is a highly traded medicinal plant, which is used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicine to improve cognitive function, decrease inflammation, and to counter the ill-effects of aging. Withanolide A and Withaferin A from Ashwagandha were shown to improve immunity and have anti-cancer property, respectively. AIM OF THE STUDY Here, we aimed to create reference DNA barcodes for W. somnifera and to authenticate root and powder samples of Ashwagandha collected from markets. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three plant specimen of W. somnifera were collected, and reference DNA barcodes were generated using rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2 DNA barcode markers. Market samples in the form of root n 33 and powder n 70 were collected and authenticated using ITS2 and trnH-psbA DNA barcodes. RESULTS Genomic DNA was successfully isolated from all plant specimens and market samples. DNA barcoding showed that 77 of samples were authentic. About 22 of non-authentic samples were powder samples and only 1 were root samples. Among the non-authentic samples, 18 were completely substituted with single species Mucuna pruriens L. DC., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., or Senna auriculata L. Roxb. and 82 were mixed samples containing more than one species. About 63 of the mixed samples contained Ashwagandha as the major ingredient. Furthermore, we identified that six taxonomically divergent plant species from four families were present as adulterants in the mixed samples. CONCLUSION DNA barcoding revealed that botanical adulteration in the market samples of Ashwagandha is significant. Powder samples are more prone to adulteration than root samples. The adulterated samples contained plant material that is not related to Ashwagandha, which warrants strict quantity control and market surveillance to derive the true medicinal benefits of this medicinal plant.","According to Authentication of the market samples of Ashwagandha by DNA barcoding reveals that powders are significantly more adulterated than roots, Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng, is a medicinal plant used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicine. It is used to improve cognitive function, decrease inflammation, and counter the effects of aging. The compounds Withanolide A and Withaferin A found in Ashwagandha can improve immunity and have anti-cancer properties, respectively. However, the study reveals that Ashwagandha products, particularly in powder form, are often adulterated with other plant species in market samples, affecting the true medicinal benefits of this"
What are some therapeutic possibilities offered by a Heilpraktiker in Germany,"This paper examines the twin German institutions of the Kur spa, and the lay licensed healing practitioner or Heilpraktiker. Through an ethnography of a Heilpraktiker and his Ayurvedic spa in a small catholic village in Germany, where patients arrive in person or as body parts by post, it examines the poly-therapeutics of the practitioner, who seems to combine in his being a dizzy array of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. It argues that the while the Ayurvedic spa can be seen as a kind of variation of the traditional German Kur, the Heilpraktikers poly-therapy has to draw upon the special nature of the practice of medicine in Germany, symbolised in part by the very figure of the Heilpraktiker. It attempts to show that the practitioners panoply of therapies is partly a symptom of an epistemic impasse at the heart of biomedicine, leading patients on an itinerant quest toward different therapeutic locales, such as the Kur, or to different therapeutic possibilities, such as the ones offered by the Heilpraktiker. But while the Kur and the Heilpraktiker would be either fringe or alternative in the Anglo-American world, in Germany the Kur is part of orthodox medicine, and the Heilpraktiker is a legal entity and the two together re-draw and make fuzzy what elsewhere seem to be clearly drawn boundaries between medicine and the spa, between pleasure and therapy, and medicine and alternative medicine.","According to research, The paper Of relics, body parts and laser beams the German Heilpraktiker and his Ayurvedic spa does not provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedies. However, it does discuss the practice of an Ayurvedic spa in Germany, which is part of a combined therapeutic approach by a Heilpraktiker, or licensed healing practitioner. This approach includes a blend of different therapeutic possibilities, which may include Ayurvedic treatments, although the paper does not detail these treatments."
What are some historical uses of Cannabis in traditional medicine,"The history of Cannabis goes along that of humankind, as speculated based on geographical and evolutionary models together with historic data collected to date. Its medical use is several thousand years old, as attested both by archeobotanical evidence of Cannabis remains and written records found in ancient texts from the sacred Vedic foundational texts of Ayurvedic medicine about 800 before current era BCE to the first known Pharmacopoea, the Chinese Shen Nung Pen Tsao Ching 1 century BCE. In this paper, we retrace the history of Cannabis traveling through the key stages of its diffusion among the most important ancient cultures up to our days, when we are facing a renaissance of its medical employment. We report through the centuries evidence of its use in numerous pathologic conditions especially for its anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and anticonvulsing properties that support the requirement to direct our present research efforts into the definitive understanding of its efficacy.","According to Medical Cannabis A plurimillennial history of an evergreen, Cannabis has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for several thousand years. Its historical usage was aimed at numerous pathologic conditions, particularly for its anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and anticonvulsing properties."
Can the Agnibala self-assessment tool in Ayurveda help identify potential health risks,"According to Ayurveda, the traditional system of healthcare of Indian origin, Agni is the factor responsible for digestion and metabolism. Four functional states Agnibala of Agni have been recognized regular, irregular, intense, and weak. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a self-assessment tool to estimate Agnibala The developed tool was evaluated for its reliability and validity by administering it to 300 healthy volunteers of either gender belonging to 18 to 40-year age group. Besides confirming the statistical validity and reliability, the practical utility of the newly developed tool was also evaluated by recording serum lipid parameters of all the volunteers. The results show that the lipid parameters vary significantly according to the status of Agni The tool, therefore, may be used to screen normal population to look for possible susceptibility to certain health conditions.","According to Development, Validation, and Verification of a Self-Assessment Tool to Estimate Agnibala Digestive Strength, a self-assessment tool has been developed to estimate Agnibala, an Ayurvedic concept referring to the four functional states of digestion and metabolism regular, irregular, intense, and weak.

What are some potential health benefits of using Asparagus racemosus in traditional medicine,"Asparagus racemosus Willd. Asparagaceae is an important medicinal plant of tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Asparagus racemosus is mainly known for its phytoestrogenic properties. With an increasing realization that hormone replacement therapy with synthetic oestrogens is neither as safe nor as effective as previously envisaged, the interest in plant-derived oestrogens has increased tremendously making Asparagus racemosus particularly important. The plant has been shown to aid in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and in alcohol abstinence-induced withdrawal symptoms. In Ayurveda, Asparagus racemosus has been described as a rasayana herb and has been used extensively as an adaptogen to increase the non-specific resistance of organisms against a variety of stresses. Besides use in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, the plant also has potent antioxidant, immunostimulant, anti-dyspepsia and antitussive effects. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus racemosus is constantly on the rise however, the supply is rather erratic and inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction in the form of deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered endangered in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of this plant is crucial. This article aims to evaluate the biological activities, pharmacological applications and clinical studies of Asparagus racemosus in an attempt to provide a direction for further research. Keeping in mind the fact that it is the active principle that imparts medicinal value to a plant consistency in quality and quantity needs to be maintained to ensure uniform drug efficacy. Also, deliberate or inadvertent adulteration needs to be dealt with at an early stage. To overcome these prevalent problems, the availability of genetically superior and uniform planting material is essential. This can be obtained by a combination of various biotechnological tools involving chemoprofiling, tissue culture and use of molecular markers. Along with the application of these methods, proper agro-techniques and adequate marketing opportunities would encourage cultivation of Asparagus racemosus and thereby contribute to its conservation. There are also several gaps in the existing literature with regard to the pharmacological actions of Asparagus racemosus. These include an incomplete understanding about the interactionsynergy between Asparagus racemosus and other plant constituents in polyherbal formulations lack of information regarding the mode of action of the various constituents of Asparagus racemosus, etc. Consequently, we have suggested a systems biology approach that includes metabolite profiling, metabolic fingerprinting, metabolite target analysis and metabonomics to enable further research.","According to Asparagus racemosus--ethnopharmacological evaluation and conservation needs, Asparagus racemosus, an important medicinal plant in Ayurveda, is known for its phytoestrogenic properties.

Can my Ayurvedic body type Prakriti provide insights about my risk for certain health issues,"BACKGROUND Body composition and types are often considered essential health indicators for lifestyle-related disease. Assessment of body type based on tridosha is regarded as a prerequisite in Ayurveda. AIM To correlate body compositions and somatotypes with Prakriti body types. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study on 463 adult individuals was done. Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured. Heath-Carter somatotypes and Prakriti body types were also determined. Tests of association were calculated. Correlation and concordance analysis was also done to infer the correlation between body composition parameters and Prakriti body types. RESULTS Kapha Prakriti have significantly higher body weight, body mass index BMI, body fat percentage and body fat mass. Vata have the lowest mean values in all body composition parameters with Pitta in the intermediate position compared to the other Prakriti types. There is a strong and positive statistical association between Prakriti body types and body composition parameters, except height. Cohens Kappa analysis reveals there is a fair concordance between Prakriti body types and somatotype. CONCLUSIONS Prakriti assessment can explain an individuals fatness as it correlates with body composition parameters and could be used to predict risk susceptibility to various complex disorders.","According to Correlation of body composition parameters and anthropometric somatotypes with Prakriti body types among the Meitei adults of Manipur, India, Prakriti body types Kapha, Vata, and Pitta are strongly linked with body composition parameters.

AIM OF THE STUDY Study aimed to validate the ethno use of SG in memory enhancement through systematic scientific protocol. The effect of SG and modern extracts of ingredients of SG was compared on cognitive function and neuroprotection in amyloid- peptide 25-35A25-35 induced memory impairment in wistar rats. Further the underlying mechanism for neuroprotective activity was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS SG was prepared as per traditional method, ethanolic extract EE was prepared by conventional method and lipid based extract was prepared by modern extraction method. All extracts were standardised by newly developed HPLC method with respect to marker compounds. SG, EE and LE were administered orally to male Wistar rats at doses of 100,200 and 400 mgkg Body Weight by feeding needle for a period of 21 days after the intracerebroventricular administration of A25-35 bilaterally. Spatial memory of rats was tested using Morris water maze MWM and Radial arm maze RAM test. The possible underlying mechanisms for the cognitive improvement exhibited by SG, EE and LE was investigated through ex-vivo brain antioxidant effect, monoamine level estimation, acetylcholine esterase AchE inhibitory effect and Brain-derived neurotropic factor BDNF levels estimation. RESULTS SG, EE and LE were analyzed by HPLC method, results showed that EE extract has high percent of selected phytoconstituents as compared with SG and LE. SG and LE decrease escape latency and searching distance in a dose dependant manner during MWM test. In case of RAM significant decrease in number of errors and increase in number of correct choices indicate an elevation in retention and recall aspects of learning and memory after administration of SG an LE. SG and LE extract can efficiently prevent accumulation of -amyloid plaque in hippocampus region.

How can the concept of Kriyakala in Ayurveda be used to detect or diagnose cancer in its early stages,"The term Kriyakala refers to the recognition of the stage of a diseases progress, which helps to determine appropriate measure to correct the imbalance in Doshas biological factors. It is a compound expression, comprised of Kriya and Kala, where Kriya means the choice to treatment medicine, food and daily-routine used to improve the disturbance in Doshas, and Kala refers to the stage of progress of a disease. Sushruta, an ancient Indian surgeon, has described the concept of Kriyakala in Varnaprashnadhyaya, an ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, which seeks to explain the incidence of Varnas in terms of Doshic disturbances. Varna, in modern parlance, may be described as an inflammatory process that may lead ulceration and chronic inflammation, promoting all stages of carcinogenesis. Abnormal interactions between Prakriti genotype and environmental factors vitiate the Doshas and impair immunity, which can lead to aberrant cell growth and cancer. Moreover, the interaction between vitiated Doshas and weak Dhatus body tissues manifests as cancers of a specific organ. Shatkriyakala six stages of progress of a disease, on the other hand, provides a framework to assess the cancer and its pathogenesis in different stages. According to Ayurvedic concepts, all cancer therapies treat the affected tissues indirectly by eliminating vitiated Doshas, rejuvenating Dhatus and restoring immunity in cancer patients. The present review describes the six stages of Shatkriyakala in detail, with an emphasis on research areas to validate the concept of Shatkriyakala. This traditional knowledge can be utilized with modern technologies to detect predisposition for cancer or diagnose cancer in its early stages.","According to Ayurvedic concept of Shatkriyakala a traditional knowledge of cancer pathogenesis and therapy, the Ayurvedic remedy for cancer involves understanding the stage of the diseases progress, which is termed Kriyakala.

Can an Ayurvedic formulation like Chandraprabha vati help prevent the development of lysozyme amyloidosis,"Lysozyme amyloidosis ALys is caused by the deposition of amyloid-like fibrils of lysozyme in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys. The treatmentprevention of ALys is not known yet. Therefore, searching for therapeutic agents for amyloidosis is of great value. In this study, we have examined the ability of the aqueous extract of herbalome thirty herbal components of Chandraprabha vati EHCV, a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, to prevent fibrillation of lysozyme. Transmission electron microscopy and multiple biophysical techniques were used to examine the processes. We found complete inhibition of the fibrillation by EHCV, whereas none of the thirty ingredients of EHCV was able to prevent the reaction, solely. We also found the EHCV induced and stabilized secondary structures of aggregation-prone state APS of lysozyme. Moreover, an increase in the secondary structure and stability of APS were found to correlate with the inhibition reaction. We conclude that EHCV modulates the structure and stability of APS and converts it into an aggregation resistant state ARS. We hypothesized that herbal components of Ayurvedic formulation may provide a combination of molecules, which could efficiently prevent aggregation reaction.","According to Herbalome of Chandraprabha vati, a polyherbal formulation of Ayurveda prevents fibrillation of lysozyme by stabilizing aggregation-prone intermediate state, the aqueous extract of the herbalome of Chandraprabha vati EHCV, a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, can prevent fibrillation of lysozyme, a condition related to Lysozyme amyloidosis ALys.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic massage in nonspecific chronic low back pain by means of a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN Sixty-four patients mean age, 54.8 years 49 women and 15 men with chronic low back pain who scored 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale VAS were randomly assigned to a 2-week massage group with 6 hours of Ayurvedic massage and external treatment n 32 or to a 2-week local thermal therapy group n 32. The study observation period was 4 weeks, consisting of a 2-week intervention phase followed by a 2-week follow-up phase. OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measure was the change of mean pain VAS from baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included pain-related bothersomeness, the Roland Disability Questionnaire, quality of life Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form, the Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire for measuring back pain-related disability, and psychological outcomes. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS Mean back pain primary outcome at week 2 was significantly reduced from 53.4 18.5 to 21.6 18.2 in the massage group and from 55.3 12.9 to 41.8 19.8 in the standard thermal therapy group mean group difference, -18.7 95 confidence interval, -28.7 to -8.7 p 0.001. While beneficial effects on pain-related bothersomeness and psychological well-being were also apparent, the Ayurvedic intervention did not improve function or disability in the short-term observation period. Both programs were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS Ayurvedic external treatment is effective for pain-relief in chronic low back pain in the short term. Further studies with longer observation periods are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of the Ayurvedic external treatment approach on function and disability.","According to Effectiveness of Ayurvedic Massage Sahacharadi Taila in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain A Randomized Controlled Trial, Ayurvedic massage is an effective remedy for short-term pain-relief in chronic low back pain. The study involved 64 patients with chronic low back pain who underwent a 2-week massage treatment with 6 hours of Ayurvedic massage. The results showed a significant reduction in back pain after the massage treatment, with beneficial effects on pain-related bothersomeness and psychological well-being also observed. However, the Ayurvedic intervention did not improve function or disability in the short-term observation period. Both programs were safe and well tolerated."
What precautions should I take when using Ayurvedic supplements to avoid lead and mercury toxicity,"BACKGROUND Use of alternative medications and herbal remedies is widespread in the United States and across the globe. These traditional medications can be contaminated with toxic metals. Despite several case reports of poisoning from such contamination, the epidemiological data are still limited. OBJECTIVES To report on a cluster of lead and mercury toxicity cases in 2011 among a community of adherents of traditional medical practice of Ayurveda. METHODS Adherents of Ayurveda were offered heavy metals screening following the identification of the index case. RESULTS Forty-six of 115 participants 40 had elevated blood lead levels BLLs of 10 gdl or above, with 9.6 of BLLs at or above 50 gdl. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest cluster of lead and mercury toxicity following use of Ayurvedic supplements described in the literature in the US. Contamination of herbal products is a public health issue of global significance. There are few regulations addressing contamination of natural products or supplements.","According to A cluster of lead poisoning among consumers of Ayurvedic medicine, the use of Ayurvedic supplements can potentially lead to lead and mercury toxicity due to contamination. In a study of 115 participants, 40 had elevated blood lead levels and 9.6 had levels at or above 50 gdl. The study highlights the need for better regulation to prevent contamination of these natural products or supplements."
Is Shilajit safe to use and what are its potential health benefits,"Shilajit is used commonly as Ayurvedic medicine worldwide which is Rasayana herbo-mineral substance and consumed to restore the energetic balance and to prevent diseases like cognitive disorders and Alzheimer. Locally, Shilajit is applied for patients diagnosed with bone fractures. For safety of the patients, the elemental analysis of Shilajit is imperative to evaluate its nutritional quality as well as contamination from heavy metals. The elemental composition of Shilajit was conducted using three advanced analytical techniques LIBS, ICP, and EDX. For the comparative studies, the two Shilajit kinds mostly sold globally produced in India and Pakistan were collected. Our main focus is to highlight nutritional eminence and contamination of heavy metals to hinge on Shilajit therapeutic potential. In this work, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS was applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the Shilajit. Our LIBS analysis revealed that Shilajit samples composed of several elements like Ca, S, K, Mg, Al, Na, Sr, Fe, P, Si, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Co, Pb, Cu, As, Hg, Se, and Ti. Indian and Pakistani Shilajits were highly enriched with Ca, S, and K nutrients and contained Al, Sr, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Pb, As, and Hg toxins in amounts that exceeded the standard permissible limit. Even though the content of most elements was comparable among both Shilajits, nutrients, and toxins, in general, were accentuated more in Indian Shilajit with the sole detection of Hg and Ti. The elemental quantification was done using self-developed calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy CF-LIBS method, and LIBS results are in well agreement with the concentrations determined by standard ICP-OESMS method. To verify our results by LIBS and ICP-OESMS techniques, EDX spectroscopy was also conducted which confirmed the presence above mentioned elements. This work is highly significant for creating awareness among people suffering due to overdose of this product and save many human lives.","According to Rapid Determination and Quantification of Nutritional and Poisonous Metals in Vastly Consumed Ayurvedic Herbal Medicine Rejuvenator Shilajit by Humans Using Three Advanced Analytical Techniques, Shilajit is an Ayurvedic herbo-mineral substance commonly used in medicine worldwide.

Can Ayurvedic constitution-based diets help in weight loss,"CONTEXT Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medical system, is receivingincreasing attention worldwide. OBJECTIVE A retrospective study was conducted to determine the effectiveness ofAyurvedic constitution-based diets on weight loss patterns of obese adults. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION Records of 200 obese adults, both male and female, who had completed 3 months of the diet therapy at Ayurvedic clinics, were examined and data collated. Techniques used included a checklist of personality traits, physical signs, and food likes and dislikes to determine the dosha. Based on the predominant doshas, diets were prescribed and closely monitored for a period of 3 months. OUTCOME MEASURES Records of height and weight and chest, abdominal, waist, arm, and thigh circumferences noted initially and after each month for the period of 3 months were obtained. RESULTS Among the 200 subjects, 55 27.5 were vatta-, 83 41.5 were pitta-, and 62 31.0 were kapha-predominant. At the beginning, kapha and pitta people were heavier than vatta people. After the 3 months of therapy, the pitta group lost the most weight 9.84. The decrease in all the anthropometric measurements was higher in pitta and kapha people than in vatta individuals. Hence, diets based on Ayurvedic constitution may prove useful in promoting weight loss. Though these promising findings support traditional Indian Ayurvedic scriptures, more closely controlled trials are needed to substantiate these findings.","According to Diets based on Ayurvedic constitution--potential for weight management, Ayurvedic constitution-based diets may prove effective in managing weight loss. The study found that after 3 months of diet therapy, the group with a predominant pitta dosha lost the most weight 9.84. Moreover, the decrease in anthropometric measurements was higher in individuals with a predominant pitta or kapha dosha compared to those with a predominant vatta dosha. However, further controlled trials are needed to confirm these promising findings."
"Can different medical traditions like Ayurveda, homeopathy, and yoga be combined for more effective treatments","The transmission of traditional medical knowledge - either institutionally or through established lineages - is assumed to involve one single tradition or another. In India however, families of doctors often engage with multiple traditions, including Ayurveda, Unani, homeopathy, yoga, and biomedicine. Parents, children, siblings and spouses trained in different medical systems occasionally share knowledge and clinical space, producing versatile therapies. By exploring such cases, I challenge studies focused on single traditions and propose to examine family space as the physical and relational proximity that enables kin doctors to experiment with plural therapies while negotiating legitimacy and authority within the changing institution of the Indian family.","According to research, The research paper doesnt provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedy."
Can Ayurvedic practices like yoga and certain herbs help manage heart disease and hypertension,"Ayurveda is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, namely, Ayus and Veda, meaning life and knowledge, respectively. It literally means science of life. Ayurveda, of which yoga is an integral part, is widely practiced in India and is gaining acceptance in many countries around the world. It is a comprehensive and a holistic system, the focus of which is on the body, mind, and consciousness. The Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal preparations, diet, yoga, meditation, and other practices. Based on the review of available studies, the evidence is not convincing that any Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective in the treatment of heart disease or hypertension. However, the use of certain spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in an overall healthy diet is appropriate. Many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners show promise and could be appropriate for larger randomized trials. Yoga, an integral part of Ayurveda, has been shown to be useful to patients with heart disease and hypertension. Yoga reduces anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life. Its safety profile is excellent. Its use as a complementary therapeutic regimen under medical supervision is appropriate and could be worth considering.","According to Ayurveda and yoga in cardiovascular diseases, the Ayurvedic treatment for heart disease and hypertension includes the use of herbal preparations, a healthy diet, yoga, and meditation. Although the evidence for the effectiveness of Ayurvedic herbal treatments is not conclusive, certain herbs and spices like garlic and turmeric are recommended as part of a healthy diet. Many herbs used in Ayurveda show promise and are suitable for more extensive randomized trials. Yoga, a key component of Ayurveda, has proven beneficial for patients with heart disease and hypertension. It helps reduce anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life with an excellent safety profile. It is appropriate as a complementary therapeutic regimen under medical supervision."
Are there any safety concerns related to the use of Ayurvedic medicines from the Ras-family,"Fifteen Ayurvedic medicines of Ras-family herbo-mineral-metallic preparations from three reputed manufactures were analysed for elemental quantification and their chemical phase identification using the energy-dispersive ED and wavelength-dispersive WD X-ray fluorescence XRF techniques, and powder X-ray diffraction XRD technique, respectively. The low-Z elements C, H, N, S and O constituting a major portion of these medicines were also determined by CHNSO analyser and further used as input for XRF analyses. The elements of concern, Hg, Pb and As, are identified in different medicine products with disquiet concentration values maximum concentration values range 4-10 and that too with substantial variations in the products from different manufacturers. These elements are identified mainly in the cinnabar -HgSmetacinnabar -HgS, litharge PbO and alacranite As4S4 phases in different medicines. Keeping in view the high concentration of chemicals of the Hg, Pb and As elements in the Ras-family medicines, it is vitally required to investigate their bioaccessibility and surmise the associated toxicological aspects. It is suggested that the formation of the bioaccessible toxic chemical forms of the Hg, Pb and As elements be avoided during preparation of the mineral ingredients or these soluble chemical forms be removed at suitable stage of the preparation. In view of large variations observed for the Hg, Pb and As based ingredients in the Ras family Ayurvedic medicine products from different manufacturers, adequate quality control mechanisms and production regulations are recommended.","According to Elemental and Chemical Phase Analyses of Ras-Family Ayurvedic Medicinal Products, fifteen Ayurvedic medicines of the Ras-family were analyzed and found to contain elements of concern such as mercury Hg, lead Pb and arsenic As, with varying concentrations across different manufacturers.

What are some Ayurvedic remedies for gingivitis and high cholesterol levels,"Triphala is a well-known prescription in Indian Ayurveda and TCM medicine for its great effect on gingivitis and hyperlipidemia. However, its solution is unstable for the containing of excessive polyphenol, leading to the production of sediment in the short term and the decrease of efficacy. Based on the analysis of sediment formation, a novel control strategy is proposed. To conduct the analysis, the sediment formation was recorded for a consecutive five days. The changes in the composition of the supernatant and the sediment were studied by the HPLC profile analysis. The main components of the sediment were identified as corilagin, ellagic acid and gallic acid, and the amount of ellagic acid sediment increased with the storage time. Then, with a series of pH status adjustments of the Triphala solution, the physical and chemical stabilities were acquired by Turbiscan and HPLC respectively. The results showed that as the pH value increased, so did the physical stability, but the particle size and TSI of the association decreased. While the fingerprint of chemical profile similarity decreased, so did the chemical stability. Combining physical and chemical stability parameters, an equilibrium point was found out. When the pH value was adjusted to 5.0, both the physical and chemical stabilities were better the verification test showed that the sedimentation inhibition rates on the 3rd, 5th,10th and15th days were 41, 55, 41, and 23, respectively. This manuscript provided a new control strategy that will pique pharmaceutical and food development engineers interest and trigger research ideas controlling the quality of decoction.","According to the study Study on the stability control strategy of Triphala solution based on the balance of physical stability and chemical stabilities, Triphala, an Ayurvedic remedy, is known for its beneficial effects on gingivitis and hyperlipidemia. However, its solution is unstable due to the presence of excessive polyphenol, which leads to sediment formation and reduced efficacy over time. The primary components of this sediment were identified as corilagin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid. A control strategy was proposed to maintain the solutions stability by adjusting its pH status. The research found that increasing the pH value increased the physical stability of the Triphala solution, but decreased its chemical stability. The optimal balance was"

Do conventional doctors and CAM practitioners have similar reasons for recommending alternative medicine treatments,"OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to compare the attitude toward complementary and alternative medicine CAM of primary care physicians trained in conventional medicine with CAM physicians whose training was for a comparable duration. The CAM physicians included practitioners of Ayurveda, homeopathy, and naturopathy. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and ninety five 295 physicians with aged 20-60 group meanstandard deviation, 48.2-12.3 years, 87 females participated. Eighty-six 86 of them were trained in Ayurveda, 90 in homeopathy, 82 in conventional medicine, and 37 in naturopathy. They were attending a 4-day residential program on Indian culture. All of them gave their signed consent to take part in the study, and the institutions ethics committee approved the study. STUDY DESIGN The study was a cross-sectional survey. Since the participants had self-selected to join for the program on Indian culture, the sampling could be considered as convenience sampling. RESULTS The number of conventionally trained and CAM physicians were similar in number and in their reasons for selecting CAM treatments. CONCLUSIONS Conventionally trained and CAM physicians were comparably likely to prescribe CAM treatments for their patients. Their reasons for prescribing CAM treatments appeared to be 1 the idea that CAM treatments deal with the cause, and 2 a belief in the treatments. A limiting factor of the survey is that it did not determine whether the belief was based on evidence or on faith alone.","According to Attitude of conventional and CAM physicians toward CAM in India, both conventionally trained physicians and CAM physicians, including those trained in Ayurveda, are comparably likely to prescribe CAM treatments such as Ayurvedic remedies for their patients.

Is Ayurvedic medicine effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE To systematically review all randomized controlled trials RCTs on the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis RA. METHODS Computerized literature searches for all RCTs of Ayurvedic medicine for RA in the following databases Medline March 1969 to March 2003, Embase February 1985 to February 2003, AMED March 1980 to March 2003, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register October 1997 to March 2003, and the abstract service of Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha CCRAS 1976 to March 2003. Hand searches were performed in 1 Sri Lankan and 3 Indian journals and the authors personal files. Key data of included studies were extracted and reviewed. The methodological quality of all studies was evaluated with the Jadad scale. RESULTS Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Trials tested either Ayurvedic medicine against placebo or other Ayurvedic medicines. In general, patient and physician global assessments on the severity of pain, and morning stiffness were used as endpoints. Of 3 placebo-controlled RCTs, 1 high-quality trial did not show benefit of the active treatment against placebo, while another incompletely reported study indicated beneficial effects of an Ayurvedic medicine. A further incompletely reported study showed no significant difference. The remaining 4 trials were difficult to interpret because they tested an Ayurvedic medicine against other Ayurvedic medicines whose effects were not proven. CONCLUSION There is a paucity of RCTs of Ayurvedic medicines for RA. The existing RCTs fail to show convincingly that such treatments are effective therapeutic options for RA.","According to Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis a systematic review, there is a lack of robust, randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicines for rheumatoid arthritis. The limited studies that exist do not provide convincing evidence that these treatments are effective for this condition. Some trials showed no significant difference between Ayurvedic medicine and a placebo, while others indicated potential beneficial effects. However, many of these studies were incompletely reported or tested an Ayurvedic medicine against other Ayurvedic medicines whose effects were not proven, making the results difficult to interpret."
What are some holistic practices from yoga that can help prevent pregnancy complications,"The prevalence of pregnancy complications are on the rise globally with severe consequences. According to the World Health Organization WHO, 2009, every minute, at least one woman dies and 20 are affected by the complications related to pregnancy or childbirth. While the root cause of pregnancy complications is unclear, it likely has physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects. The Vedas are a rich source of antenatal health care guidelines in all these aspects. The primary objective of the authors was to compile the scriptural and scientific evidence for a holistic antenatal model of yoga with emphasis on sociocultural Indian practices.","According to A holistic antenatal model based on yoga, Ayurveda, and Vedic guidelines, the Vedas provide antenatal health care guidelines that address physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of health.

What are some potential challenges of integrating traditional medicine practices like Ayurveda and Homeopathy into mainstream healthcare in India,"The National Rural Health Mission has stated as one of its key mandates the mainstreaming of the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy AYUSH systems in order to help solve the human resource shortage in Indian healthcare. This has been planned at the primary level by providing training to AYUSH practitioners on primary care and national health programmes at the secondary level by establishing departments of AYUSH in the district and taluka level hospitals and at the tertiary level by establishing AYUSH centres of excellence as referral centres, and research, development and supervision points. The practical challenges to be considered include a gross divergence in the basic philosophy of practice disparities in approach to specific clinical conditions differences in their normative approach in decision making an unclear policy for cross referral and problems of cross practice that could potentially rise in this condition. Mainstreaming of AYUSH into the existing public health system can have certain ethical implications not doing good by failing to concentrate on the community value judgments about AYUSH doing harm by a confusing plurality in approach and unhealthy segregation of practices without healthy dialogue between practitioners of either system not disclosing which type of practitioners AYUSH or allopathy the patient is seeing lack of proper public accountability mechanisms at the primary care and grassroots levels and, finally, lack of social justice. These ethical issues have to be considered while mainstreaming AYUSH.","According to Mainstreaming AYUSH an ethical analysis, the National Rural Health Mission is aiming to integrate Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy AYUSH into mainstream healthcare in India. This integration will occur at three levels primary care and national health programs through training AYUSH practitioners secondary care by creating AYUSH departments in district and taluka level hospitals and tertiary care by establishing AYUSH centers of excellence for referral, research, development, and supervision.

What lifestyle changes can I make according to Ayurveda to promote longevity and slow aging,"Ayurveda is a natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year. Common spices are utilized in treatment, as well as herbs and herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas are used for rejuvenation, promotion of longevity, and slowing of the aging process. A group of purification procedures known as Panchakarma removes toxins from the physiology. Whereas Western allopathic medicine is excellent in handling acute medical crises, Ayurveda demonstrates an ability to manage chronic disorders that Western medicine has been unable to. It may be projected from Ayurvedas comprehensive approach, emphasis on prevention, and ability to manage chronic disorders that its widespread use would improve the health status of the worlds population.","According to Utilization of Ayurveda in health care an approach for prevention, health promotion, and treatment of disease.

What are some alternative treatments for skin diseases and how safe are they,"According to survey data, 35-69 of patients with skin disease have used complementary and alternative medicine CAM in their lifetime. A literature search on this subject reveals a number of studies on the efficacy of CAM treatment for dermatologic conditions, as well as a number of articles showing the growing prevalence of CAM use amongst patients suffering from these conditions. Given the consensus amongst these articles that dermatologists require increased education on CAM, this paper presents an overview of some of the most widely used systems of alternative medicine to serve as a tool for practicing dermatologists. Specifically, the history and theory behind psychocutaneous therapies, traditional Chinese medicine including acupuncture, homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine will be described, along with current evidence for their efficacy and reports of their adverse effects. The authors conclude that more evidence and better studies are needed for each of the major CAM modalities before they may be considered as independent therapeutic options. Moreover, given the shortage of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of CAM, dermatologists should obtain a thorough history of CAM use from their patients. In general, ingestible substances including most homeopathic, Ayurvedic, and traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulations that are not US FDA regulated should be viewed with caution as they may cause severe adverse effects such as arsenicosis and hepatotoxicity. On the other hand, less invasive techniques such as acupuncture and psychocutaneous therapies may be more acceptable given their low-risk profile. Ultimately, until the availability of more sound data, these treatments should primarily be used in combination with conventional treatment and rarely independently.","According to Complementary and alternative medicine in dermatology an overview of selected modalities for the practicing dermatologist, Ayurvedic medicine is a widely used system of alternative medicine for treating skin diseases. However, the authors caution that due to a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic remedies, they should be used with caution. These treatments, like most homeopathic and traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulations that are not US FDA regulated, can potentially cause severe adverse effects such as arsenicosis and hepatotoxicity. Hence, these treatments should primarily be used in combination with conventional treatment and rarely independently."
What are the regulatory guidelines for the safety and efficacy of herbal health products,"Background Regulatory affairs play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry and are incorporated in all stages of drug development. Objective Approval criteria practices were developed as a resolution of the governments desire to create policies to protect public health by controlling the safety and efficacy of merchandise in areas including pharmaceuticals, complementary color medicines, veterinary medicines, medical devices, and even food products and cosmetics. Method Herbal health products are in practices in all parts of the world under either their legal systems or expert councils or agencies guides. They include botanicals, health supplements, health foods, complimentary medicines, traditional medicines or following pathies like Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The requisite parameters for registration or recognition of products by various major global regulatory agencies were reviewed, and compiled under purview. Results In India, licensing these products is under the act provisions and the rules known as the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, whereas globally regulatory provisions follow the guidelines of developed countries like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, the Therapeutic Goods Act, or the World Health Organizations regulations for herbal products. Conclusions The present communication highlights the provisions of regulatory andor licensing requirements related to corporates, product composition, specifications, quality parameters, manufacturing methodology, stability, safety, preclinical studies, clinical studies, etc. for herbal products and the respective guidelines at one site. Highlights Ultimately, all regulatory agencies across the world highlight majorly the safety and thereafter the efficacy for any products under the category.","According to Regulatory Aspects of Traditional Indian Medicines TIM in India and in International Purview, herbal health products, including Ayurvedic remedies, are regulated globally.

How do Ayurvedic practitioners individualize treatment plans for their patients,"BACKGROUND The curricula of Ayurveda programmes emphasise various theoretical constructs such as Tridosha three factors determining the state of health, Agnibala digestive strength, Samprapti patho-physiology, among others. It is often argued that practitioners follow an individualised approach based on these principles while treating patients. Yet, dependable data on their real-world influence is lacking. The aim of this study was to record the extent to which these constructs drive decision-making among Ayurveda practitioners and to examine whether these constructs determine individualisation of the interventions. METHODS We employed an emailed survey to record physicians perceptions. Convenience sampling was chosen as the sampling method. Registered Ayurveda practitioners located across India with a minimum of five years of clinical experience were invited to participate. Five case-based scenarios depicting different clinical conditions were presented to the physicians. Questions that accompanied each case scenario asked the physicians to record clinical diagnoses, treatment plans, and the Ayurveda principles that determined their treatment. RESULTS A total of 141 physicians responded, from whom we received 152 responses as seven physicians responded to more than one scenario. The results suggest a significant lack of consensus among physicians regarding clinical diagnoses, interventions, and their understanding of pathophysiology in the given clinical scenarios. Many conflicting opinions were also noted. CONCLUSION Theoretical constructs do not appear to determine either prescriptions or individualisation uniformly. Two ethical questions arise Is this situation due to an inherently weak theoretical framework of Ayurveda and How can one justify spending hundreds of hours teaching these theories","According to Myth and reality of theory-driven individualised practice in Ayurveda Mapping physicians approaches using case-based scenarios, the theoretical constructs of Ayurveda such as Tridosha three factors determining the state of health, Agnibala digestive strength, and Samprapti patho-physiology do not uniformly determine Ayurveda prescriptions or individualisation of treatments. The study found a significant lack of consensus among Ayurvedic physicians regarding clinical diagnoses and interventions based on these principles. This suggests that the application of these principles in real-world practice may vary widely among practitioners."

What are some traditional methods used in Sri Lanka to treat animal diseases,"Systems for preventing and treating animal diseases have been employed in Sri Lanka since ancient times, long before the advent of modern veterinary science. Many such methods have been used, mainly in ruminants but also in trained elephants. Records of animal treatments can be found in historical documents. The first recorded treatment is that of the elephant Kadol Etha belonging to King Dutugemunu 161-137 BC. Later, the physician King Buddhadasa AD 340-368 is reported to have operated on a snake. The methods and experience gained by practitioners have usually been passed on in secrecy from father to son. However, records on ola leaf manuscripts are available for consultation in the National Museum and the Ayurvedic Research Institute, while others are in the possession of native veterinary practitioners. Approximately 2,000 practitioners are scattered throughout the island the majority treat animals on a part-time basis. The marking of animals using brands in symbolic shapes, inhalation of medicinal fumes and oral medication are the common treatment methods.","According to Traditional systems for preventing and treating animal diseases in Sri Lanka, the key Ayurvedic remedies for treating animal diseases include the marking of animals using brands in symbolic shapes, inhalation of medicinal fumes, and oral medication.

What are some Ayurvedic remedies that can help protect against the harmful effects of radiation,"The use of ionizing radiation, which is the cornerstone of cancer treatment, is compromised by the radiosensitivity of normal tissues. A chemical that can give selective benefit to the normal cells against the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation has been a long-sought goal. However, most of the compounds studied have shown inadequate clinical application owing to their inherent toxicity, undesirable side effects, and high cost. Studies carried out in the past 2 decades have shown that some of the classical Indian Ayurvedic drugs Amritaprasham, Ashwagandha Rasayana, Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha, Narasimha Rasayana, and Triphala Churna possess radioprotective effects. In the current review, an attempt is made to summarize the radioprotective observations of these Ayurvedic drugs and the mechanisms responsible for the radioprotective effects.","According to Rasayana drugs from the Ayurvedic system of medicine as possible radioprotective agents in cancer treatment, the Ayurvedic drugs that possess radioprotective effects and can potentially benefit normal cells against the effects of ionizing radiation in cancer treatment include Amritaprasham, Ashwagandha Rasayana, Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha, Narasimha Rasayana, and Triphala Churna. These drugs offer potential benefits with fewer undesirable side effects and high costs compared to other compounds studied."
How can Vedic principles of therapy help improve mental health,"This paper introduces Vedic principles of therapy as a holistic integration of healing and human development. The most integrative aspect is a consciousness-based approach in which the bottom line of the mind is consciousness itself, accessed by transcending mental activity to its simplest ground state. This directly contrasts with unconscious-based approaches that hold the basis of conscious mind is the unconscious, such as analytic, humanistic, and cognitive-behavioral approaches. Although not presented as a specific therapeutic approach, interventions associated with this Vedic approach have extensive support in the applied research literature. A brief review of experimental research toward a general model of mind-and cutting-edge developments in quantum physics toward nonlocal mind-shows a convergence on the ancient Vedic model of mind. Comparisons with contemporary therapies further show that the simplicity, subtlety, and holistic nature of the Vedic approach represent a significant advance over approaches which have overlooked the fundamental ground state of the mind.","According to Vedic principles of therapy, the key Ayurvedic remedy information focuses on a consciousness-based approach for holistic healing and human development.

Can Ayurvedic herbs potentially help in the management of COVID-19,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has sparked a new spectrum of investigations, research and studies in multifarious directions. Efforts are being made around the world for discovery of effective vaccinesdrugs against COVID-19. In this context, Ayurveda, an alternative traditional system of medicine in India may work as an adjuvant therapy in compromised patients. We selected 40 herbal leads on the basis of their traditional applications. The phytomolecules from these leads were further screened through in-silico molecular docking against two main targets of SARS-CoV-2 i.e. the spike protein S structural protein and the main protease MPRO non-structural protein. Out of the selected 40, 12 phytomolecules were able to block or stabilize the major functional sites of the main protease and spike protein. Among these, Ginsenoside, Glycyrrhizic acid, Hespiridin and Tribulosin exhibited high binding energy with both main protease and spike protein. Etoposide showed good binding energy only with Spike protein and Teniposide had high binding energy only with main protease. The above phytocompounds showed promising binding efficiency with target proteins indicating their possible applications against SARS-CoV-2. However, these findings need to be validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments with above mentioned potential molecules as candidate drugs for the management of COVID-19. In addition, there is an opportunity for the development of formulations through different permutations and combinations of these phytomolecules to harness their synergistic potential.","According to In-silico efficacy of potential phytomolecules from Ayurvedic herbs as an adjuvant therapy in management of COVID-19, selected herbal leads from Ayurveda could potentially work as an adjuvant therapy in patients compromised with COVID-19.

What can be done to improve the understanding of mental health issues among practitioners of alternative medicine like Ayurveda and Homeopathy,"BACKGROUND It is common knowledge that patients seek treatment for psychiatric illnesses from various sources including the alternative medicine. Views and attitudes of clinicians often influence the provision of appropriate mental health care for these patients. In this context, it was intended to study the views of the practitioners of alternative medicine toward psychiatric disorders, patients and interventions. METHODS The study was conducted as a questionnaire-based survey among a sample of practitioners of alternative medicine specifically Ayurveda and Homeopathy, who were practicing in Solapur and adjoining areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka states in India. A semi-structured Attitudinal Inventory for Psychiatry questionnaire was used. Demographic and professional data were collected. RESULTS Out of 62 practitioners approached, 50 responded 80.6. There were no significant differences in the views of practitioners toward psychiatry and psychiatrists based on respondents gender, place of residence, location of practice, type of alternative medicine, exposure to psychiatric patients, or if they knew someone with psychiatric illness. Attitudes were generally positive, but variable. Among negative observations were that approximately 60 of respondents felt that a patient can be disadvantaged by being given a psychiatric label and 58 believed that emotions are difficult to handle. A considerable proportion 40 of the respondents felt doctors other than psychiatrists were unable to identify psychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION This studys findings suggest that practitioners of alternative medicine have mixed views about mental illness, patients and treatment. Some of their negative views and perceived inability to identify psychiatric disorders may be addressed through further training, information sharing and collaborative work.","According to research, The research paper does not provide specific information on any Ayurvedic remedy for any condition or illness."
What are some Ayurvedic plants or compounds that could potentially help in the treatment of COVID-19,"All the plants and their secondary metabolites used in the present study were obtained from Ayurveda, with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. The selected secondary metabolites have been experimentally validated and reported as potent antiviral agents against genetically-close human viruses. The plants have also been used as a folk medicine to treat cold, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome in India and across the globe since time immemorial. The present study aimed to assess the repurposing possibility of potent antiviral compounds with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and also with host-specific receptor and activator protease that facilitates the viral entry into the host body. Molecular docking MDc was performed to study molecular affinities of antiviral compounds with aforesaid target proteins. The top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further validated by 100 ns molecular dynamic MD simulation run. The stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp and quercetin with main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore, compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of antiviral plants preventively.","According to Repurposing potential of Ayurvedic medicinal plants derived active principles against SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins revealed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA studies, the Ayurvedic compounds curcumin, gingerol, and quercetin have been identified as potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.

These proteins play a crucial role in mediating viral replication and can potentially block the viral replication"
What lifestyle changes can I make to help regulate my circadian rhythm and improve heart health,"Early awakening and early to bed as well as good conduct, thought, diet, interpersonal dealings and physical activity have been suggested for healthy life in Ayurveda. Circadian rhythms, coordinated in part by the parietal hypothalamic-pituitary and adrenal mechanisms, have been reported in almost all variables examined thus far, including the circulation. It is possible that all metabolic functions undergo circadian rhythms. It remains to be explored whether these rhythms may be optimized by Ayurvedic practices. The onsets of myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and strokes have been reported to exhibit a circadian variation, with increased frequency in the second quarter of the day. An increased physical and mental load caused by an attempt to prepare for the day may be important in triggering acute cardiovascular events. Depending on their timing, meditation Ayurvedic practice, n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, beta-blockers and estrogens may have beneficial effects, whereas progestins and mental load may have adverse effects on heart rate and blood pressure variability, which may be expressed by different circadian patterns. Around the clock serial recordings of blood pressure and heart rate during usual activities and lifestyles may be recorded and may be analyzed by computer-implemented curve fitting to assess the about 24-hour circadian variation, among other rhythmic, chaotic, and trend components of the time structure chronome of these variables. The new disease risk syndrome circadian hyper-amplitude-tension CHAT, a condition characterized by an excessive circadian amplitude of blood pressure, cannot be ascertained on the basis of single casual blood pressure measurements. The International Chronome Ecological Study of Heart Rate and blood pressure Variability in various ethnic groups aims at collecting further evidence regarding the role of blood pressure and heart rate variability in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, while also examining any role played by ethnicity and lifestyle-associated factors.","According to New insights into circadian aspects of health and disease, Ayurvedic practices such as early awakening, early to bed, good conduct, thought, diet, interpersonal dealings and physical activity have been suggested for a healthy life and may help optimize circadian rhythms. Specific practices such as meditation can have beneficial effects on heart rate and blood pressure variability. Additionally, the intake of n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and estrogens could also have positive effects on these variables. However, mental load and progestins may have adverse effects. The paper also suggests that blood pressure and heart rate can be recorded and analyzed over a 24-hour period to assess circadian variation and other components."
Can taking Bacopa during pregnancy help prevent cognitive decline in babies if the mother is on antiepileptic medication,"OBJECTIVES Levetiracetam LEV is an antiepileptic recommended during pregnancy. Bacopa monneri is a medicinal herb used in Ayurveda for improvement of cognition. Data on effects of LEV and Bacopa on cognition is inadequate. The study evaluated the cognitive effects of LEV on rat offspring of dams exposed to LEV and whether pretreatment with Bacopa monnieri, inhibits the potential cognitive decline by LEV. METHODS Pregnant rats were allocated into four groups of three rats each. Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 received 2 gum acacia, LEV 270 mgkg, LEV 270 mgkg Bacopa 100 mgkg and LEV 270 mgkg Bacopa 200 mgkg respectively during pregnancy and lactation. Three pups from all dams were chosen at random and exposed to passive avoidance, Hebb-Williams and Morris water maze tests to check for their cognition and relevant histopathology was done. RESULTS In the passive avoidance model groups 3 and 4, showed an increase in escape latency compared with group 2, demonstrating an improved learning p0.05. In Hebb-Williams maze, the time taken to reach reward chamber by group 2 increased compared to group 1, p0.006, showing cognitive decline. Neuronal count in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex decreased significantly in group 2, which improved in group 3 4 however there was distortion of architecture in group 4. CONCLUSIONS LEV exposure in intrauterine and neonatal period induced cognitive decline in rat offsprings and Bacopa 100 mgkg prevented LEV induced cognitive decline. However safety of exposure to Bacopa during the gestation period has to be evaluated.","According to Levetiracetam exposure during prenatal and postnatal period induces cognitive decline in rat offsprings, not completely prevented by Bacopa monnieri, the Ayurvedic herb Bacopa monnieri has been shown to mitigate the cognitive decline in rat offspring exposed to the antiepileptic Levetiracetam LEV during pregnancy and lactation. The study found that pretreatment with Bacopa monnieri at a dosage of 100 mgkg helped prevent LEV-induced cognitive decline. However, the safety of Bacopa monnieri exposure during pregnancy needs to be further evaluated."

Can Ayurvedic medicines help manage symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder,"RATIONALE Ayurvedic herbal medicines are administered as part of disease management for many neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD and linked comorbid challenges. The biochemistry of the behavioral abnormalities as observed in comorbid conditions is already reported to involve neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA, serotonin 5-HT and dopamine DA. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of ayurvedic medicines on neurotransmitter levels in IMR 32. Such a study will give some insight into the molecular mechanism of the action of these medicines and help us to understand their contributions in neurotransmitter homeostasis. METHODS Solutions of Brahmi, Brahmi vati, Brahmi ghrita and Saraswata ghrita, each at 50 M, were added to differentiated IMR 32 cells and grown for 24 h. The cell secretion was analysed by ultra-fast liquid chromatographymass spectrometry UFLCMS in electrospray ionisation ESI mode for the neurotransmitters DA, 5-HT and GABA. The mobile phase selected was 0.1 formic acid with 15 gmL Na2 -EDTA A and 0.1 formic acid in acetonitrile B introduced in the ratio of 928. RESULTS All neurotransmitters under study were eluted within 7 min with GABA eluting at 3.82 min, 5-HT at 4.48 min and DA at 5.47 min, respectively. Linearity was excellent with a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.999 repeatability and accuracy were also within acceptable range. All herbal drugs evaluated increased the neurotransmitter levels and Brahmi vati increased the neurotransmitter levels to a larger extent. CONCLUSIONS Decreased levels of neurotransmitters were observed in behavioral abnormalities which were also observed in children with ASD. Herbal medicines given as part of ayurvedic medicine increased the neurotransmitter levels in IMR 32. Thus, these ayurvedic medicines when prescribed to children with ASD might alleviate the abnormal behavioral symptoms by maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis.

Can the herbal formulation Siotone help in managing stress and its related symptoms,"Siotone ST is a herbal formulation comprising of Withania somnifera, Ocimum sanctum, Asparagus racemosus, Tribulus terristris and shilajit, all of which are classified in Ayurveda as rasayanas which are reputed to promote physical and mental health, improve defence mechanisms of the body and enhance longevity. These attributes are similar to the modern concept of adaptogenic agents, which are, known to afford protection of the human physiological system against diverse stressors. The present study was undertaken to investigate the adaptogenic activity of ST against chronic unpredictable, but mild, footshock stress induced perturbations in behaviour depression, glucose metabolism, suppressed male sexual behaviour, immunosuppression and cognitive dysfunction in CF strain albino rats. Gastric ulceration, adrenal gland and spleen weights, ascorbic acid and corticosterone concentrations of adrenal cortex, and plasma corticosterone levels, were used as the stress indices. Panax ginseng PG was used as the standard adaptogenic agent for comparison. Additionally, rat brain levels of tribulin, an endogenous endocoid postulated to be involved in stress, were also assessed in terms of endogenous monoamine oxidase MAO A and MAOB inhibitory activity. Chronic unpredictable footshock induced marked gastric ulceration, significant increase in adrenal gland weight and plasma corticosterone levels, with concomitant decreases in spleen weight, and concentrations of adrenal gland ascorbic acid and corticosterone. These effects were attenuated by ST 50 and 100 mgkg, p.o. and PG 100 mgkg, p.o., administered once daily over a period of 14 days, the period of stress induction. Chronic stress also induced glucose intolerance, suppressed male sexual behaviour, induced behavioural depression Porsolts swim despair test and learned helplessness test and cognitive dysfunction attenuated retention of learning in active and passive avoidance tests, and immunosuppression leucocyte migration inhibition and sheep RBC challenged increase in paw oedema in sensitized rats. All these chronic stress-induced perturbations were attenuated, dose-dependently by ST 50 and 100 mgkg, p.o. and PG 100 mgkg, p.o.. Chronic stress-induced increase in rat brain tribulin activity was also reversed by these doses of ST and by PG. The results indicate that ST has significant adaptogenic activity, qualitatively comparable to PG, against a variety of behavioural, biochemical and physiological perturbations induced by unpredictable stress, which has been proposed to be a better indicator of clinical stress than acute stress parameters. The likely contribution of the individual constituents of ST in the observed adaptogenic action of the polyherbal formulation, have been discussed.","According to Adaptogenic activity of Siotone, a polyherbal formulation of Ayurvedic rasayanas, Siotone ST is an Ayurvedic remedy made up of Withania somnifera, Ocimum sanctum, Asparagus racemosus, Tribulus terristris and shilajit.

What are some benefits of using Rasasindura in Ayurvedic medicine,"Rasasindura RS is an Ayurvedic medicine, which contains 99 -HgS. It is used as a rejuvenating agent and commonly used to treat diseases such as syphilis, insomnia, high fever, and nervous disorders. Cinnabar ore -HgS is a well-known mineral, which is readily available. Despite it, Ayurvedic practitioners adopted an involved and tedious procedure for the preparation of RS. In this study, three samples, one was Ayurvedic RS, the second one was the commercial HGS, and the third one was cinnabar ore CN, were physiochemically examined. Zebrafish model was employed for toxicity study with an oral dose of 100 mgkgday for the three samples for 10 days. We found that RS conferred novel physicochemical properties, which were not seen in HGS and CN. Significantly, the average crystallite size of RS was lowest 26 nm as compared to HGS 31 nm and CN 34 nm, and the rate of increase of crystallite size with temperature was lowest in RS. RS did not show any significant behavioral toxicity in zebrafish, which was seen with the HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish. HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish showed a significantly high p 0.001 decrease 77 7.6 and 51 6.5, respectively of glutathione GSH levels in the brain, however, for RS-treated zebrafish, the change of GSH was insignificant 26 2.5, p 0.05. Interestingly, HGS significantly altered the -aminobutyric acid GABA in brain tissue. Therefore, among all three samples, RS exhibited the lowest toxicity, which can be credited to the distinct toxicokinetics by these samples.","According to Ayurvedic processing of -HgS gives novel physicochemistry and distinct toxicokinetics in zebrafish, Rasasindura RS is an Ayurvedic remedy that contains approximately 99 -HgS.

Can Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine provide a personalized approach to managing my health issues,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda, Indias natural health care tradition, has a unique way of classifying human population based on individual constitution or prakriti. Ayurvedas tridosha theory identifies principles of motion vata, metabolism pitta, and structure kapha as discrete phenotypic groupings. Patwardhan et al. 2005 hypothesized in a paper published in this journal that there is a genetic connotation to prakriti and as proof of this concept showed a correlation between HLA alleles and prakriti type, establishing a rationale and preliminary experimental support for the concept of an association between HLA alleles and the Ayurvedic tridosha theory of individual prakriti types. This work is both part of and a catalyst for a wider revolution in the scientific investigation of Ayurveda in India, referred to as Ayurvedic biology and AyuGenomics. Subsequently, Chen et al. 2007 reported a similar study in this journal using a classification based on Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM theory. CONCLUSIONS The findings of a genetic basis for both Ayurvedic and TCM classifications indicate a commonality between Asias great medical traditions in their diagnostic typologies and a genetic basis for Asian traditional medicines theory of discrete and discernable groupings of psycho-physiologic differences. Accordingly, new horizons have opened for collaborative East-East research and for an individualized approach to disease management and activation of the full range of human potential, as articulated in Ayurveda and TCM.","According to Ayurvedic genomics establishing a genetic basis for mind-body typologies, Ayurvedas tridosha theory identifies principles of motion vata, metabolism pitta, and structure kapha as discrete phenotypic groupings.

How can managing stress contribute to maintaining good health and longevity,"Recent research on causes of disease and aging has increasingly supported the importance of stress. One theory of the relationship between stress and disease is based on the concept of homeostasis, a term coined by Cannon over 50 years ago to signify those states and mechanisms responsible for the staying power of the body. Bernard, Cannon, Selye and other leading researchers held that full, normal function of the self-regulating or homeostatic power of the body maintains the balanced, integrated condition we recognize as health. Failures in this capacity, such as those produced by frequent stressful experiences, can result in disease or death. Theories of health and disease surprisingly similar to this have existed since ancient times, and in widely different cultures. This review discusses both the fundamental elements of these theories and the current neuroendocrine research supporting their validity and immediate relevance. The connections between ancient and modern knowledge described herein were made possible largely by the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a scholar and teacher of the ancient vedic tradition of India. A key part of Ayurveda that has been obscure to modern science is the substance ojas, which the classical texts say maintains balance of the physiology. In this article, specific steroids or steroid classes are proposed as likely candidates for both the ordinary and the superior types of ojas described in Ayurveda. Current evidence for the functions of these steroids, as well as their role in stress, disease and the maintenance of health, is reviewed. The knowledge of Ayurveda, as recently brought to light by Maharishi, includes methods for recovering and maintaining optimal function of steroidal systems. Such effects may help mediate the improvements in health and increased longevity attributed to Ayurveda and other ancient methods.","According to Stress, steroids, and ojas neuroendocrine mechanisms and current promise of ancient approaches to disease prevention, the Ayurvedic substance ojas is crucial for maintaining physiological balance. The paper suggests that specific steroids or steroid classes could be the ordinary and superior types of ojas described in Ayurveda. It also highlights that the knowledge of Ayurveda, as brought to light by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, includes methods for recovering and maintaining optimal function of steroidal systems, which could potentially help in improving health and increasing longevity."
"What are the health benefits of the medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia, also known as Giloy, used in Ayurvedic medicine","Tinospora cordifolia Giloy is a medicinal plant used in folk and Ayurvedic medicines throughout India since ancient times. All the parts of the plant are immensely useful due to the presence of different compounds of pharmaceutical importance belonging to various groups as alkaloids, diterpenoid lactones, glycosides, steroids, sesquiterpenoid, and phenolics. These compounds possess pharmacological properties, which make it anti-diabetic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hepato-protective, and immuno-modulatory. However, due to the increasing population, there is an inadequate supply of drugs. Therefore, this review focuses on phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, clinical application and its conservation strategies so that the plant can be conserved for future generations and utilized as alternative medicine as well as to design various pharmacologically important drugs.","According to Tinospora cordifolia Giloy Phytochemistry, Ethnopharmacology, Clinical Application and Conservation Strategies, Tinospora cordifolia, also known as Giloy, is a medicinal plant used in Ayurvedic medicine.

Can Ayurveda provide effective treatments for sleep disorders and anxiety,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinsons disease, and Alzheimers disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurvedas comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.","According to Utilization of Ayurveda in health care an approach for prevention, health promotion, and treatment of disease.

What are some traditional Indian remedies for treating cuts and wounds,"India has a rich tradition of plant-based knowledge on healthcare. A large number of plantsplant extractsdecoctions or pastes are equally used by tribals and folklore traditions in India for treatment of cuts, wounds, and burns. The present review thus attempts to analyze the ethnobotanical knowledge base for treatment of cuts and wounds which includes a usage of plants, methods employed by tribals and folklore practices prevailing in India. Pharmacological reports available on Indian medicinal plants employing various wound healing models and its underlying molecular mechanism, wherever available, has also been briefly reviewed. This pharmacological validation on Indian medicinal plants is very limited and a large number of plants used in tribal and folklore with enormous potential have not been validated for their wound healing activity. This review therefore attempts to bridge the lacunae in the existing literature and offers immense scope for researchers engaged in validation of the traditional claims and development of safe and effective and globally accepted herbal drugs for cuts and wounds.","According to Ethnopharmacological approaches to wound healing--exploring medicinal plants of India, a large number of plants, plant extracts, decoctions and pastes are used in traditional Indian medicine to treat cuts, wounds, and burns.

Do traditional medicines for sex selection actually influence the gender of a baby,"OBJECTIVE Sex-ratio at birth in families with previous girls is worse than those with a boy. Our aim was to prospectively study in a large maternal and child unit sex-ratio against previous birth sex and use of traditional medicines for sex selection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sex-ratio among mothers in families with a previous girl and in those with a previous boy, prevalence of indigenous medicine use and sex-ratio in those using medicines for sex selection. RESULTS Overall there were 806 girls to 1000 boys. The sex-ratio was 7201000 if there was one previous girl and 1781000 if there were two previous girls. In second children of families with a previous boy 1017 girls were born per 1000 boys. Sex-ratio in those with one previous girl, who were taking traditional medicines for sex selection, was 9281000. CONCLUSION Evidence from the second children clearly shows the sex-ratio is being manipulated by human interventions. More mothers with previous girls tend to use traditional medicines for sex selection, in their subsequent pregnancies. Those taking such medication do not seem to be helped according to expectations. They seem to rely on this method and so are less likely use more definitive methods like sex selective abortions. This is the first such prospective investigation of sex ratio in second children looked at against the sex of previous children. More studies are needed to confirm the findings.","According to Sex ratio at birth in India, its relation to birth order, sex of previous children and use of indigenous medicine, there is evidence that more mothers with previous girls tend to use traditional Ayurvedic medicines for sex selection in their subsequent pregnancies.

How can Ayurvedic concepts be used to understand and treat depression,"The appropriation of biopsychiatric concepts such as depression, and their reframing in clinical and academic discussions, are important parts of the revitalization of bht vidy as Ayurvedic psychiatry. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Kerala from 2009 to 2011, in this article we explore the process and the controversies of translating and correlating the biopsychiatric notion of depression, as a discrete and biologic pathological entity, with Ayurvedic notions of body, mind, and mental distress. Depression, conceptualized as a neurochemical imbalance, is, we argue, relatively compatible with Ayurvedic notions of a fluent body and mind, and so is easier to correlate with Ayurvedic concepts of doFormula see textic imbalances and blockages of channels than the former psychoanalytically dominated model of depression. The appropriation of depression within Ayurvedic discourse challenges the dichotomy of universal and culture-specific disorders, and this has a significant impact on mental health programs in Kerala.","According to Appropriating depression biomedicalizing Ayurvedic psychiatry in Kerala, India, depression, conceptualized as a neurochemical imbalance, is seen to be relatively compatible with Ayurvedic notions of a fluent body and mind.

Can the herb Brahmi be used to help treat Alzheimers disease and other neurological disorders,"Ayurveda is the medicinal science, dealing with utilization of naturally available plant products for treatment. A wide variety of neuroprotective herbs have been reported in Ayurveda. Brahmi, Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic ayurvedic herb known to be effective in neurological disorders from ancient times. Numerous approaches including natural and synthetic compounds have been applied against Alzheimers disease. Amyloid- and Tau are the hallmarks proteins of several neuronal dysfunctions resulting in Alzheimers disease. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein known to be involved in progression of Alzheimers disease. The generation of reaction oxygen species, increased neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity are the major physiological dysfunctions associated with Tau aggregates, which leads to dementia and behavioural deficits. Bacoside A, Bacoside B, Bacosaponins, Betulinic acid, etc are the bioactive component of Brahmi belonging to various chemical families. Each chemical component known have its significant role in neuroprotection. The neuroprotective properties of Brahmi and its bioactive components including reduction of ROS, neuroinflammation, aggregation inhibition of Amyloid- and improvement of cognitive and learning behaviour.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for age-related hearing loss and tinnitus,"BACKGROUND Presbycusis is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both ears at high frequencies, which affects more than half of the older adults by the age of 75 years and is often accompanied by tinnitus and cognitive deterioration. Unfortunately, there are no treatments available to restore hearing loss. Treatment mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and communication with hearing aids. Traditional medicine like Ayurveda also explains ailments of a similar nature as Badhirya and advises using drugs with antiaging and neuroprotective activity for treatment. In Ayurveda, Badhirya and Karnanada senile deafness with tinnitus are due to vitiation of Vata Dosha. Treatments such as topical oil pooling Karnapurana are usually advised to counter Vata, improve hearing capacity, and reduce tinnitus. Kshirabala Taila, a medicated oil formulation prepared with Sida cordifolia Linnaeus, is one of the most preferred oils for topical oil pooling in such conditions, as it has a definitive indication for sensory dysfunctions. Drugs like Withania somnifera L. Dunal Ashwagandha are also used, as they ameliorate neurodegeneration and help to improve cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE We propose an exploratory randomized controlled trial study for evaluating the efficacy of TOPMAC Topical Oil Pooling with Kshirabala Taila and Supplementation of Ashwagandha Churna in tinnitus suppression and hearing and cognitive function protection in patients aged 60-75 years with mild to moderate presbycusis. METHODS A parallel, 2-group, exploratory randomized controlled trial will be conducted in an Indian Ayurvedic research center at its outpatient service. Participants N60 with mild to moderate presbycusis will be recruited by screening. Participants will be randomized computer-generated 11 to receive either basic treatment and health education BTHE or BTHETOPMAC for 24 weeks. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in the protection of hearing function. The secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in tinnitus suppression and cognitive function protection. RESULTS This project was funded in January 2023. The institutional ethics committees at National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma 312020NARIPTech2036 and Institute for Communicative and Cognitive Neuro Sciences IEC006 approved this study. The first patient was enrolled in September 2023 22 participants were enrolled as of August 2024. The data analysis is yet to start, and the results are expected to be published by January 2025. CONCLUSIONS If this exploratory trial is proven effective, it will steer the setting of a definitive randomized controlled trial to test whether the TOPMAC intervention can be incorporated as a cost-effective integrative approach for managing presbycusis. The Indian government has already launched a National Program for Prevention and Control of Deafness to benefit the deaf population.

Can the medicinal plant Withania somnifera help in the prevention or treatment of breast cancer,"Withaferin A hereafter abbreviated as WA is a promising anticancer steroidal lactone abundant in a medicinal plant Withania somnifera native to Asia. The rootleaf extract of Withania somnifera, which belongs to the Solanaceae family, continues to be included in the Ayurvedic medicine formulations of alternative medicine practice. Numerous chemicals are detectable in the rootleaf extract of Withania somnifera e.g., withanolides WA, withanone, withanolide A, etc., alkaloids, sitoindosides, etc., but the anticancer effect of this medicinal plant is largely attributed to WA. Anticancer effect of WA was initially reported in the early 70s in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell model in vitro Since then, numerous preclinical studies have been performed using cellular and animal models of different cancers including breast cancer to determine cancer therapeutic and chemopreventive effects of WA. Chemoprevention, a word first introduced by Dr. Michael B. Sporn, was intended to impede, arrest, or reverse carcinogenesis at its earliest stages with pharmacologic agents. This review succinctly summarizes the published findings on anticancer pharmacology of WA in breast cancer focusing on pharmacokinetic behavior, in vivo efficacy data in preclinical models in a therapeutic and chemoprevention settings, and its known effects on cancer-relevant cellular processes e.g., growth arrest, apoptosis induction, autophagy, metabolic adaptation, immune function, etc. and molecular targets e.g., suppression of oncogenes such as estrogen receptor-, STAT3, etc..

What are some herbs or plants that can boost the immune system and reduce stress,"BACKGROUND Constant exposure to various stressors, such as immune pressure, rapidly increasing population, deleterious changes in the ecosystem, climate change, infection with emerging and re-emerging pathogens, and fast-paced lifestyle, is a critical factor in the globally increasing incidences of immunocompromising health conditions, as well as stress. Synthetic chemotherapeutic agents, which are widely available in the commercial market, may be highly efficacious, but most are immunosuppressive and exert many side effects. METHODS Herein, we comprehensively reviewed current literature from various scientific databases such as Bentham Science, PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer, etc. The inclusionexclusion criteria based on literature with high importance was adopted to analyze and compile salient information from the authentic bibliographic sources. RESULTS Undoubtedly, the pivotal characteristics of immunostimulants and immunomodulators in the maintenance of the health and productivity of humans, as well as animals, cannot be overlooked. Numerous herbs used in ethnoveterinary medicine can be successfully employed as adjuvant rehabilitators to negate the deleterious effects of chemotherapeutics. The sources of these medicinal remedies are part of long traditions in different regions of the world, such as Indian Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, which have been developed through empirical experience. Traditional medicine employs a holistic approach to the prevention of disease, and traditional herbal medicines are a source of many components with a high therapeutic value that are used in modern allopathic medicine. Globally, many studies have been conducted on these herbs and have revealed unique active constituents that activate the innate immune system through the stimulation of macrophages and lymphocytes, and modulation of the cytokine profile, which leads to a state of alertness with a subsequent reduction in the incidence of infection. Immunomodulatory constituents with herbal origins are termed as phytochemicals, including flavonoids, glycosides, polysaccharides, terpenoids, essential oils, various bitters, and alkaloids all these compounds exert vital, multidimensional effects. Efforts have focused on screening plant preparations to identify adjuvant immune properties furthermore, several potent phytol adjuvants have been experimentally proven to downregulate inflammatory reactions in addition to enhance specific adaptive responses to vaccines.

Can Ayurvedic medicinal plants help manage symptoms of arthritis,"Chronic joint inflammatory disorders like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, which are manifested by joint dysfunction, show an upsurge in inflammation and oxidative stress. Although conventional anti-arthritic drugs are being used to relieve pain from arthritic symptoms, they usually cause severe side effects. Traditionally used Ayurvedic medicinal plants are a promising alternative for the management of arthritic symptoms, as they are safe and effective. Ayurvedic medicinal plants improve arthritic symptoms by reducing joint tenderness, joint pain, swelling, bone and cartilage damage, and increasing knee flexion, walking distance and sports activities. These beneficial effects of Ayurvedic medicinal plants on arthritis are mediated through various cellular mechanisms including inhibition of the inflammatory markers NF-B, cytokines, adipokines, PGE2, NO, iNOS, COX-2, and MMPs and induction of antioxidant status by decreasing free radicals, lipid peroxidation, and myeloperoxidase, and increasing antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2, and HO-1. Thus, a strategy requires using these Ayurvedic medicinal plants to treat arthritis. This article describes the status of inflammation and oxidative stress in arthritic conditions. We also provide evidence that Ayurvedic medicinal plants and their bioactive components are highly effective in improving arthritic symptoms.","According to Inflammation and ROS in arthritis management by Ayurvedic medicinal plants, Ayurvedic medicinal plants are an effective and safe alternative in the management of arthritic symptoms.

Can Ayurvedic treatments help with oral health issues like gum disease and toothaches,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda, an ancient medical science originating in India, also is practiced in the United States. The authors conducted a study primarily to explore the involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in treating oral diseases. METHODS Eighty-five practitioners participated in this cross-sectional survey. The authors obtained self-reported data on demographics of the practitioners, the general and oral health conditions they treated, and the treatment modalities used. They performed descriptive statistical and logistic regression analyses by using statistical software. RESULTS Participants predominantly were female and white or non-Hispanic, as well as part-time practitioners. Their educational backgrounds ranged from a 5-year bachelors degree in Ayurveda to short-term training. Of the 60 respondents who answered the question about treating oral diseases, 25 42 percent reported that they did so. Conditions treated were related to oral malodor, gingival or periodontal disease and toothache. Ayurvedic treatments administered for these conditions primarily were preventive in nature. CONCLUSIONS Ayurvedic practitioners in the United States treat a variety of oral diseases by using predominantly preventive traditional care. Ayurvedic practitioners of Asian origin and those who practiced for a longer duration were more likely to report that they treated oral diseases. Larger, population-based studies are needed to understand more fully the current role of Ayurvedic practitioners in oral health care. Ayurvedic treatment modalities aimed at oral diseases need to be evaluated through rigorous randomized controlled trials for safety and effectiveness. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Patients with limited or no access to oral health care might seek Ayurvedic treatment, and those who have access to conventional oral health care might wish to complement it with Ayurvedic treatment. Practitioners can incorporate preventive Ayurvedic treatments, which are based mainly on natural products, into overall preventive care regimens, if proven safe and effective.","According to Involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in oral health care in the United States, Ayurvedic practitioners in the US treat a variety of oral diseases, including oral malodor, gingival or periodontal disease, and toothache. The treatments used are primarily preventive and are often based on natural products. However, the effectiveness and safety of these treatments need further evaluation through rigorous randomized controlled trials."

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for jaundice,"This paper describes beliefs and practices associated with jaundice and its treatment by ayurvedic physicians vaidyas in Kathmandu. It documents continuity of ancient ayurvedic ideas and practices as well as syncretism between ayurvedic and allopathic Western, biomedical traditions in modern Nepal. Popular beliefs about the cause of jaundice appear to have evolved to fit therapeutic practices adopted by vaidyas from allopathy. An implication of this finding is that beliefs about causation do not necessarily precede and channel therapeutic choices they may also function to rationalize and provide meaning to experiences of illness and therapy. The data also suggest a number of hypotheses about the efficacy of ayurvedic treatment for jaundice.","According to Ayurvedic treatment for jaundice in Nepal, the treatment of jaundice by Ayurvedic physicians, or vaidyas, in Kathmandu involves a combination of ancient Ayurvedic practices and Western biomedical traditions. The specific methods or remedies used are not detailed in the abstract. The paper suggests that popular beliefs about the cause of jaundice have evolved to align with these therapeutic practices.

What is Suvarna Bhasma and how is it used in Ayurvedic medicine,"Suvarna Bhasma SB is a gold particle-based medicine that is used in Ayurved to treat tuberculosis, arthritis and nervous diseases. Traditionally, the Ayurved preparation processes of SB do exist, but they are all long, tedious and involve several steps. Due to this, there is a possibility of bypassing the necessary Ayurved processes or non-adherence to all steps or use of synthetic gold particles. Our aim is to characterize 5 commercial SB preparations from 5 different manufacturers. A comparative physicochemical, pharmacokinetic PK and bioaccumulation study was carried out on all the 5 SB preparations. The general appearance such as color and texture of these 5 samples were different from each other. The size, shape and gold concentration from 32-98 wt varied among all the 5 SBs. The accumulation of ionic gold in zebrafish and gold concentration profiles in rat blood were found to be significantly different for all the 5 SBs. Non-compartmental PK model obtained from the concentration-time profile showed significant differences in various PK parameters such as peak concentration Cmax, half-life t12 and terminal elimination slope z for all the 5 SB preparations. SB-B showed the highest Cmax 8.55 gL, whereas SB-D showed the lowest Cmax 4.66 gL. The dissolution of ionic gold from SBs in zebrafish tissue after the oral dose had a 5.5-fold difference between the highest and lowest ionic gold concentrations. All the 5 samples showed distinct physicochemical and biological properties. Based on characteristic microscopic morphology, it was found that 2 preparations among them were suspected of being manufactured by non-adherence to the mentioned Ayurved references.","According to Physicochemical Variation in Nanogold-Based Ayurved Medicine Suvarna Bhasma Produced by Various Manufacturers Lead to Different In Vivo Bioaccumulation Profiles, Suvarna Bhasma SB is an Ayurvedic medicine made from gold particles, traditionally used to treat tuberculosis, arthritis, and nervous diseases.

What are some medicinal plants that can be used as natural antimicrobial agents,"A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microgml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.","According to Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants, the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula have significant antimicrobial properties.

Do the seeds of Artocarpus heterophyllus have any impact on male sexual performance or fertility,"According to Ayurvedic literature of Sri Lanka, roasted seeds of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. Family Moraceae has aphrodisiac activity. However, some reproductively active young men in rural areas of Sri Lanka claim that consumption of these seeds few hours prior to coitus disrupts sexual function. Because of these two conflicting claims, it was thought useful to scientifically investigate the effects of A. heterophyllus seeds on male sexual function and fertility. This was done using a seed suspension in 1 methylcellulose SS in rats. In a sexual behaviour study using receptive female rats, an oral administration of 500 mgkg dose of SS markedly inhibited libido, sexual arousal, sexual vigour and sexual performance within 2 hr. Further, the treatment induced a mild erectile dysfunction. These antimasculine effects on sexual function was not evident 6 hr post treatment indicating rapid onset and offset of action. Further, these actions on the sexual behaviour was not due to general toxicity, liver toxicity, stress or reduction in blood testosterone level but due to marked sedative activity. In a mating study, SS failed to alter ejaculating competence and fertility. These results suggest that A. heterophyllous seeds do not have aphrodisiac action, at least, in rats.","According to Artocarpus heterophyllus seeds inhibits sexual competence but not fertility of male rats, the roasted seeds of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., contrary to traditional Ayurvedic beliefs, do not act as an aphrodisiac. Instead, they inhibit sexual competence in male rats, causing disruptions in libido, sexual arousal, vigour, and performance, and even inducing mild erectile dysfunction. These effects were found to have a rapid onset, within 2 hours, and offset, after 6 hours, and were not due to general toxicity, liver toxicity, stress, or reduction in blood testosterone level but due to marked sedative activity. However, these seeds did not affect the fertility of the rats."

How can Ayurveda improve my overall quality of life,"Ayurveda is one of the ancient systems of health care of Indian origin. Roughly translated into Knowledge of life, it is based on the use of natural herbs and herb products for therapeutic measures to boost physical, mental, social and spiritual harmony and improve quality of life. Although sheltered with long history and high trust, ayurveda principles have not entered laboratories and only a handful of studies have identified pure components and molecular pathways for its life-enhancing effects. In the post-genomic era, genome-wide functional screenings for targets for diseases is the most recent and practical approach. We illustrate here the merger of ayurveda and functional genomics in a systems biology scenario that reveals the pathway analysis of crude and active components and inspire ayurveda practice for health benefits, disease prevention and therapeutics.","According to Merger of ayurveda and tissue culture-based functional genomics inspirations from systems biology, Ayurvedic principles primarily involve the use of natural herbs and herb products for therapeutic measures to enhance physical, mental, social, and spiritual harmony and to improve the quality of life.

What lifestyle changes or dietary tips can help balance Vata as per Ayurveda to slow down the progression of Parkinsons disease,"OBJECTIVE The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, is the oldest scientifically based system of medicine in the world. According to Ayurvedic concepts, there are 3 humors or Doshas Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The combination of these Doshas in varying degrees leads to ones constitution, referred to as Prakruti. Prakruti determines ones physical, physiologic, and mental character and disease vulnerability. This clinical study was undertaken to determine the constitutional typing of individuals with known idiopathic Parkinsons disease PD compared with that of nonparkinsonian controls. This study sought to validate the ancient observation that persons of Vata Prakruti are at risk for nervous system diseases. PD was used as a test case because the exact cause is not known. METHODS Patients with established PD n75 and closely related controls with no known neurologic disease n73 were assessed for their Ayurvedic constitution Prakruti. An Ayurvedic constitutional assessment form and an independent Ayurvedic clinical assessment were used in the patients and controls. RESULTS The total mean score standard deviation for Vata was 11.03.9 in patients with PD and 6.93.0 in controls. This finding was significant p0.0001, indicating that the incidence of PD is highest in those with Vata Prakruti. The incidence of PD was higher in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge gained from this study may be helpful in identifying the vulnerable population, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing disease progression or development of treatment-related complications by keeping Vata in balance through anti-Vata diet and lifestyle changes as prescribed in Ayurveda.","According to Ayurvedic constitution prakruti identifies risk factor of developing Parkinsons disease, individuals with a Vata Prakruti, one of the three Ayurvedic humors or Doshas, are at a higher risk for developing Parkinsons disease. This study found that the incidence of Parkinsons disease was highest in those with a Vata Prakruti and was also higher in men than women. The knowledge from this study suggests that maintaining balance in the Vata through an anti-Vata diet and lifestyle changes, as prescribed in Ayurveda, could potentially help in identifying vulnerable populations, delay the onset of symptoms, slow disease progression, or prevent the development of treatment-related complications."

How can Rasayana therapy help improve the quality of life for advanced cancer patients,"Anorexia and cachexia are major clinical problems seen in a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer. Weight loss has also been identified as an indicator of poor prognosis in cancer patients. Around 20 of patients with advanced cancer present mortality from the effects of malnutrition rather than from cancer itself. Early nutrition intervention has seen to improve outcomes in cancer patients such as weight gain, treatment tolerance, and improved quality of life QoL. Effective therapies for addressing these threatening conditions are lacking. Pharmacotherapeutic agents such as corticosteroids, megestrol acetate, and cyproheptadine have several adverse reactions and also lack satisfactory results. Rasayana therapy is known to prevent loss of body mass and at the same time help to improve appetite and increase patients QoL. The Rasayana compound used by us to prevent cachexia mainly includes swarna sindoor, Hirak bhasma, and suvarna bhasma. To evaluate benefits of Rasayana therapy on these variables, we maintain complete documentation of different clinical variables in all cancer patients. Here, in this observational study, we analyzed the data collected from a group of stage IV breast cancer patients n 30 receiving Rasayana therapy. Patients were followed at an interval of every 15 days from baseline for 3 months. Furthermore, at each visit, there weight was recorded on calibrated digital weight balance. QoL in these patients was recorded at quarterly interval using functional assessment of cancer therapies questionnaire. It was seen that in the duration of 3 months patients appetite increased significantly P 0.03. Significant weight gain was seen in patients P 0.04. Significant improvement was also seen in QoL especially related to QoL subdomains of physical wellbeing P 0.01, emotional wellbeing P 0.04, and functional wellbeing P 0.001. Rasayana therapy was seen to be well tolerated by all patients.","According to Addressing and targeting earnest condition of advance breast cancer-related anorexia and cachexia through Rasayana therapy, Rasayana therapy, which includes the compounds swarna sindoor, Hirak bhasma, and suvarna bhasma, can help prevent loss of body mass and improve appetite in patients with advanced cancer.

Can Ayurveda help predict my predisposition to certain diseases based on my constitution type,"BACKGROUND Ayurveda is an ancient system of personalized medicine documented and practiced in India since 1500 B.C. According to this system an individuals basic constitution to a large extent determines predisposition and prognosis to diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime. Ayurveda describes seven broad constitution types Prakritis each with a varying degree of predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting types, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of modern predictive medicine, efforts are being directed towards capturing disease phenotypes with greater precision for successful identification of markers for prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the different constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates. METHODS Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types were identified following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian population of Indo-European origin. The peripheral blood samples of these individuals were analysed for genome wide expression levels, biochemical and hematological parameters. Gene Ontology GO and pathway based analysis was carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were significant enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types. RESULTS Individuals from the three most contrasting constitutional types exhibit striking differences with respect to biochemical and hematological parameters and at genome wide expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological parameters like haemoglobin exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of genes showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation. A significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were observed in these extreme constitution types. CONCLUSION Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise for future predictive medicine.","According to Whole genome expression and biochemical correlates of extreme constitutional types defined in Ayurveda, Ayurveda describes seven broad constitution types Prakritis that determine an individuals predisposition and prognosis to diseases, as well as therapy and lifestyle regime. Among these, Vata, Pitta, Kapha are the most vulnerable to diseases. The study found that individuals from these three constitution types exhibit striking differences with respect to biochemical and hematological parameters and at genome wide expression levels, including liver function tests, lipid profiles, and haemoglobin levels. These constitutional types also showed significant enrichment in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation.

How can traditional Chinese medicine help improve overall health and well-being,"This paper focuses on the worldview hypotheses and research design approaches from nonlinear dynamical complex systems NDS science that can inform future studies of whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine WS-CAM, e.g., Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and homeopathy. The worldview hypotheses that underlie NDS and WS-CAM contextual, organismic, interactive-integrative - Pepper, 1942 overlap with each other, but differ fundamentally from those of biomedicine formistic, mechanistic. Differing views on the nature of causality itself lead to different types of study designs. Biomedical efficacy studies assume a simple direct mechanistic cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily outcome, an assumption less relevant to WS-CAM outcomes. WS-CAM practitioners do not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Rather, they intervene to modulate an intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and to create a more favorable environmental context for the emergence of health, e.g., with dietary changes compatible with the constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system thereby fosters the emergence of indirect, diffuse, complex effects throughout the person and the persons interactions with hisher environment. NDS theory-driven study designs thus have the potential for greater external and model validity than biomedically driven efficacy studies e.g., clinical trials for evaluating the indirect effects of WS-CAM practices. Potential applications of NDS analytic techniques to WS-CAM include characterizing different constitutional types and documenting the evolution and dynamics of whole-person healing and well-being over time. Furthermore, NDS provides models and methods for examining interactions across organizational scales, from genomicproteomicmetabolomic networks to individuals and social groups.","According to Methodological implications of nonlinear dynamical systems models for whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine, Ayurvedic treatments do not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Instead, they aim to modulate an intrinsic central imbalance of a person as a system and create a more favorable environmental context for the emergence of health. This might involve making dietary changes compatible with the constitutional type of the person. The rebalancing of the system fosters the emergence of indirect, complex effects throughout the person and their interactions with their environment. The paper also suggests that nonlinear dynamical systems NDS analytic techniques could be used to characterize different constitutional types and document the evolution and dynamics of whole-person healing and well-being over time."

What Ayurvedic treatments could be beneficial for individuals suffering from hemiplegia,"INTRODUCTION Hemiplegia and the Ayurvedic description of ardhanga disease presents with comparable clinical features. This pilot trial compared two traditional procedure-based treatments Navarakizhi, a massage of cooked navara rice in a medicated hot bolus, and pinda sweda, a similar massage made of a different type of rice. This article also describes the steps of a double-blind trial in Ayurveda, which was hitherto considered difficult to perform. METHODS Eighteen 18 patients suffering from hemiplegia with disease duration of 6 months to 2 years received treatment with navarakizhi or pinda sweda for 7 days. Both groups received the same Ayurvedic oral medications for 14 days. All steps of randomization and blinding of procedure-based therapy in Ayurveda are described. The physiotherapist evaluated muscle tone, muscle strength, tendon reflexes, range of movement, and balance of functional abilities at baseline, 7 days, and 14 days after starting therapy. Both patient and the assessing physiotherapist were blinded. RESULTS Intraquartile range values showed better range in patients who received navarakizhi than those who received pinda sweda. DISCUSSION A larger trial is needed to confirm the superiority of navarakizhi over the rice varieties in treating hemiplegia. This study demonstrates that double-blind randomized clinical trials are possible in Ayurvedic settings, ending the long-debated controversy in trial methodology involving procedure-based traditional medicines.","According to Navarakizhi and pinda sweda as muscle-nourishing Ayurveda procedures in hemiplegia double-blind randomized comparative pilot clinical trial, two traditional Ayurvedic treatments, Navarakizhi and pinda sweda, can be used to treat patients suffering from hemiplegia.

Can the herb Jibanti help to reduce stress-related damage in the body,"The herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl. family Orchidaceae, sold as Jibanti in West Bengal, is used in Rasayana therapy in Ayurveda. Its effect on the modulation of the two antioxidant enzymes peroxidase and catalase has been studied in mice liver during cold water swim CWS stress using appropriate controls. The drug, i.e. the aqueous ethanolic extract of the herb whole plant was found to increase peroxidase titre in the hepatic cells of normal mice. But in the stressed group, the drug displayed no effect on the peroxidase content, while it elicited an elevation of the catalase content. infinity-Tocoferol was used as the standard drug. These data suggested that the drug can ameliorate the peroxidative damage caused in mice by CWS stress.","According to Induction of antioxidative enzyme by the ayurvedic herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl. in mice, the herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl., also known as Jibanti, is used in Ayurvedas Rasayana therapy.

How can the AYUSH systems of medicine contribute to the universal health coverage in India,"Universal health coverage UHC in the Indian context is understood as easily accessible and affordable health services for all citizens. The Planning Commission of India constituted a High Level Expert Group HLEG in October 2010 for the purpose of drafting the guidelines of UHC. While the primary focus of UHC is to provide financial protection to all citizens, its delivery requires an adequate health infrastructure, skilled health human resources, and access to affordable drugs and technologies so that all people receive the level and quality of care they are entitled to. This paper attempts to link the ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy AYUSH systems of medicine with UHC. Here, the AYUSH system refers to the AYUSH workforce, therapeutics and principles, and their individual role in delivering UHC to the citizens of India. In outlining the role of AYUSH, the paper lays stress on the 10 guiding principles of UHC, as proposed by the HLEG. However, as the AYUSH system is not the principal health service provider in India, the dominant system being that of allopathic medicine, a few components of UHC may not fit neatly into the AYUSH system. This paper has adopted the definition of UHC quoted by the HLEG.","According to Can the AYUSH system be instrumental in achieving universal health coverage in India, the AYUSH system, which includes Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, is considered in the delivery of Universal Health Coverage UHC in India. This involves the use of the AYUSH workforce, therapeutics and principles. However, given that the dominant health service provider in India is allopathic medicine, not all components of UHC may integrate smoothly with the AYUSH system."
Can Ayurvedic treatment help in faster recovery from COVID-19 infection,"BACKGROUND Specific treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Outcomes of clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success. Therefore, it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against COVID-19. PURPOSE This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical trial. METHODS The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India vide Registration No. CTRI202005025273 and conducted at the Department of Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India. 1 g of Giloy Ghanvati Tinospora cordifolia and 2 g of Swasari Ras traditional herbo-mineral formulation and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha Withania somnifera and Tulsi Ghanvati Ocimum sanctum were given orally to the patients in treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30 min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu taila traditional nasal drop in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast. Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF- and high sensitivity C-reactive protein hs-CRP on day 1 and day 7 of the study. RESULTS By day 3, 71.1 and 50.0 patients recovered in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100 recovery by day 7, while it was 60.0 in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF- in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20 times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40 absolute reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS Ayurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination. Reduced inflammation markers suggested less severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the treatment group. Moreover, there was no adverse effect observed to be associated with this treatment.","According to Randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial on the efficacy of ayurvedic treatment regime on COVID-19 positive patients, the Ayurvedic treatment regime evaluated on asymptomatic COVID-19 patients included 1 g of Giloy Ghanvati Tinospora cordifolia, 2 g of Swasari Ras a traditional herbo-mineral formulation, 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha Withania somnifera and Tulsi Ghanvati Ocimum sanctum, administered orally twice per day for 7 days.

What are the health benefits of using neem in traditional medicine,"The divine tree neem Azadirachta indica is mainly cultivated in the Indian subcontinent. Neem has been used extensively by humankind to treat various ailments before the availability of written records which recorded the beginning of history. The world health organization estimates that 80 of the population living in the developing countries relies exclusively on traditional medicine for their primary health care. More than half of the worlds population still relies entirely on plants for medicines, and plants supply the active ingredients of most traditional medical products. The review shows the neem has been used by humankind to treat various ailments from prehistory to contemporary.","According to Neem Azadirachta indica prehistory to contemporary medicinal uses to humankind, the neem tree Azadirachta indica, primarily cultivated in the Indian subcontinent, has been extensively used throughout history to treat various ailments.

Can Ayurvedic formulations like Guduchi and Madhuyashti enhance fertility and longevity,"Formulations from the traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, have long been considered to have potent life-style enhancing effects, possibly by their effects on key life-history attributes. Although several studies have reported beneficial effects of these formulations on different components of life history, few have investigated their concurrent influence on various life-history traits. Here, we report the results of an investigation showing the effect of two well-known Ayurvedic formulations, Guduchi and Madhuyashti, on fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were either grown i.e., larval exposure andor maintained i.e., adult exposure on standard food supplemented with 0.5 Guduchi or 0.5 Madhuyashti. It was observed that the longevity of adult flies of both sexes was not affected on feeding Guduchifood, but fecundity of the females was greatly enhanced. Fecundity was also found to be affected by the adult food and whether their mates were grown on Guduchi or normal food. Madhuyashti, on the other hand, significantly reduced mean longevity and had a stimulatory effect on female fecundity. This fecundity enhancing effect however seemed to be mediated through its effect on the males. Interestingly, much of these effects interacted with age in a complex way, making it difficult to generalize the overall effect of these formulations on the reproductive output of the flies. Ourstudy underlines the importance of evaluating the interacting effects of these and similar formulations on a range of life-history traits in a holistic way to understand their utility better.","According to Complex effects of Ayurvedic formulation Guduchi and Madhuyashti on different components of life history may elude the elixir effect, the Ayurvedic formulations Guduchi and Madhuyashti have different effects on the fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Guduchi does not affect the longevity of the flies but greatly enhances the fecundity of the females, especially when they and their mates are raised on Guduchi. Madhuyashti, however, reduces mean longevity while stimulating female fecundity, an effect that seems to be mediated through its impact on the males. The effects of these formulations interact with age in complex ways, making it difficult"
What are some potential benefits of using herbs and spices in Ayurveda for health improvement,"Background Ayurveda, the traditional Indian therapeutic system, involves herbs and spices as drug ingredients and a kind of food intake regulation. The health and curative aspects of plant products are often ascribed to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities AA. However, it seems somewhat possible to correlate the AA of herbal extracts or plant isolates with their phenolic contents PC. Objective Indian researchers have carried out some tests for the determination of AA and PC of plant products that are worth mentioning. Methods Among the herbal analysis techniques, the important contributions of Indians and people of Indian origin in this field include the remarkable separation of phenolic compounds, including the use of reversed-phase columns, on-line HPLC, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH assay to effectively screen and identify antioxidant compounds from herbal extracts, and other chromatographic, spectrographic, and spectroscopic techniques, in the analysis of complex biological matrices. Results The aim of this paper is to present an overview of such arguments with reference to herbal drugs and food intake regulation for specific ailments. Conclusions The lack of uniformity in the use of test protocols for antioxidant assays particularly using the DPPH free radical and differences in in vitro mechanisms of antiradical activity and in vivo metabolism of polyphenols have been the issues associated with these experiments that have been raised by researchers in the period from 2000 onward.","According to Studies on the Determination of Antioxidant Activity and Phenolic Content of Plant Products in India 2000-2017, the key Ayurvedic remedy information includes the use of herbs and spices as drug ingredients and food intake regulation.

What are some traditional treatments for cancer used in Sri Lanka,"OBJECTIVES While the introduction of biomedicine within the Sri Lankan healthcare system has resulted in reduced reliance on traditional, complementary and alternative medicine TCAM over the last century in Sri Lanka, treatment modalities such as Ayurveda, Sinhala and traditional religious practices still receive considerable public support. Cancer is an increasing burden in Sri Lanka, and whilst Sri Lankans are known to use TCAM for everyday ailments, there has been no research examining the role of TCAM in the context of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of TCAM use by cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. METHODS Data were obtained from two Sri Lankan hospitals using a consecutive convenience sample of 500 cancer patients currently receiving biomedical treatment, over a 10-week period in 2008. RESULTS Analyses showed that 67.4 of those surveyed used one or more TCAM in conjunction with biomedicine for cancer treatment. The most common were Sinhala, Ayurveda and traditional religious practices. Of those patients who used TCAM, 95.0 gave the main reason for usage as they thought it would cure their cancer. The strongest reason for not using TCAM was on advice from their doctor 80.5. CONCLUSIONS The high use of TCAM amongst cancer patients in Sri Lanka raises numerous important issues, including those related to patient safety, potential benefit, interactions with biomedical cancer treatments, and delays in seeking biomedical cancer care. Further research is needed to explore the decision-making processes of cancer patients, including the perceived benefitslimitations of key processes in biomedical and TCAM care.","According to The use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine in Sri Lankan cancer care results from a survey of 500 cancer patients, a significant 67.4 of surveyed cancer patients in Sri Lanka used one or more traditional, complementary and alternative medicines TCAM in conjunction with biomedicine for cancer treatment.

What are some medicinal plants used in traditional Indian medicine for treating respiratory and digestive disorders,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Medicinal Plant resources of forest origin are extensively used in India for various systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, Homeopathy, Allopathy, Siddha and Ethnic etc. The tribal communities around the Kakrajhore forest in West Medinipur district of West Bengal have their own traditional knowledge based system of curing many diseases using the forest based plant resources similar to ayurveda. The forest comprises of one of the unique treasure and rich source of diversified ethno-botanical wealth and therefore extensive studies is required for proper documentation including ethnomedicinal knowledge of local tribes. AIM OF THE STUDY The present study was initiated with an aim to inventorize the ayurvedic medicinal plant recourses and explore the traditional knowledge of tribal people of Kakrajhore forest to treat several diseases along with the sustainable management and conservation of medicinal plants. METHODS The information on the medicinal plant resources were gathered through floristic inventorization with proper sampling method in the study area N224257.05, E863458.02 during the year 2015. For floristic inventorization the study area of 312 ha was delineated by using GPS Receiver. Then total mapped area was divided by virtual grid of 100m apart in both East-West and North-South direction to allocate 60 sample plots by random sampling. In addition to inventorization, the use value UV of the species was determined and the informant consensus factor ICF was calculated for the medicinal plants found in the study area based on personal interview. Further exploration was carried out to establish linkage with Ayurveda. RESULTS The present survey has identified 57 numbers of ethno-medicinal plants belonging to 39 families, used for preparing medicinal remedies. The habit of the plants includes 35 trees, 28 shrubs, 23 herbs and 14 climbers. The most frequently utilized plant parts were the Roots Tuber roots 26, Stem which includes Bark, Tubers, Bulb, Rhizome, Gum, Wood Young shoots 24, Leaves 18, Fruits 13, and Seeds 10. The most frequent happening ailments are asthma and bronchitis, constipation and dyspepsia, diarrhea, dysentery, ulcer, rheumatism, arthritis, fistula and piles troubles. Most of the Plants 88 had more than a single therapeutic use. The most important plant species on the basis of use value were Smilex ovalifolia, Emblica officinalis, Curculigo orchioides, Croton roxburghii, Asparagus racemosus, Ziziphus nummularia, Ichnocarpus frutescens, Cisssus adnata, Buettneria herbacea, Litsea glutinosa, Vernonia anthelmintica and Chlorophytum borivilianum. There was a strong agreement among the informants related to the usage of the plants ICF 0.65-0.93. As per the standard literature in Ayurveda, maximum numbers of documented species 33 are found to be used for digestive system disorder which is analogous to ethnomedicinal use 30, followed by skin related problem i.e. 13 and 20 respectively. CONCLUSIONS Results show that people living around Kakrajhore forest area hold valuable knowledge of the uses of plant resources and some of the ayurvedic plants represent an important component in local livelihood. Though the Kakrajhore Forest area is rich in medicinal plant resources but the species are susceptible to be endangered by intense exploitation by human communities.

Is it safe to use Ayurvedic products imported from India,"OBJECTIVE Despite a growing body of literature on complementary and alternative medicine, there is still limited information on the use of Ayurveda in the United States. Because Ayurveda is one of the worlds major traditional medical systems, knowledge of its use is important. In particular, information on utilization by Asian Indians living in the United States is needed due to increased immigration from India and related regions. Recent reports of heavy metal contamination of some imported Ayurveda products underscore this need. For this reason, an exploratory survey was conducted. DESIGN A semistructured 21-item questionnaire was administered using face-to-face interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING The study comprised a convenience sample of 64 Asian Indians living in Northern California. OUTCOME MEASURES Main outcome measures included sociodemographic variables, questions on awareness, knowledge and use of Ayurvedic products or services, use of other nutritionalherbal products, and reasons for use. RESULTS In the sample, 95 of the participants were aware of Ayurveda, 78 had knowledge of Ayurvedic products or treatments, and about 59 had used or were currently using Ayurveda. Only 18 of those using Ayurveda had informed their Western medical doctors. CONCLUSIONS Given its common use in the United States by Asian Indians, its cultural relevance, potential therapeutic value, and possible safety concerns, physician and consumer education along with more empirical research is warranted.","According to Exploring the prevalence of Ayurveda use among Asian Indians, there is a high prevalence of Ayurveda use among Asian Indians living in Northern California, with 95 of participants being aware of Ayurveda, 78 having knowledge of Ayurvedic products or treatments, and about 59 had used or were currently using Ayurveda. However, only 18 of those using Ayurveda had informed their Western medical doctors. The paper highlights a need for more education and research into Ayurveda, given its common use, cultural relevance, potential therapeutic value, and possible safety concerns."
What are the potential risks and benefits of using Ayurvedic medicine for health treatment,"Non-allopathic Indian medicines, referred to elsewhere in the world as complementary and alternative medicine have gathered increasing recognition in recent years with regard to both treatment options and health hazards. Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems. These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet, herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as non-drug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India, particularly in rural India, where 70 of the population lives. The difference between modern medicine and these systems stems from the fact that the knowledge base of many of the above systems, unlike Western medicine, is based on years of experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and has been handed down generations both through word of mouth and treatises. The focus on non-allopathic systems of medicine in India can be attributed to various causes including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80 of the countrys population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. Elsewhere, the increasing use of herbal products worldwide and the growth of the herbal product industry has led to increasing concern regarding their safety. The challenges in these non-allopathic systems relate to the patient, physician, regulatory authorities, the abusemisuse of these medicines, quality and purity issues. Safety monitoring is mandated by a changing ecological environment, the use of insecticides, new manufacturing techniques, an as yet unregulated pharmaceutical industry, the availability of combinations of herbs over the counter and not mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the need to look at the active principles of these medicines as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The Indian traditional medicine industry has come a long way from the times when it was considered unnecessary to test these formulations prior to use, to the introduction of Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for the industry. However, we still have a long way to go. The conflict between the traditional practitioners and the purists demanding evidence of safety and efficacy needs to be addressed. There is an urgent need for the practitioners of the allopathic and non-allopathic systems to work together to optimise the risk-benefit profile of these medicines.","According to The use and safety of non-allopathic Indian medicines, Ayurveda is the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India. The Ayurvedic system encompasses a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet, herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as non-drug therapies. These treatments are based on years of experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and have been passed down across generations. They are largely used due to their rich tradition, easy availability, and the dependency of a significant portion of the population on these drugs.

What types of complementary and alternative medicine are commonly used by pharmacy students,"AIM Attitudes and practice concerning complementary and alternative medicine CAM are currently an area of considerable importance. However, little is known about the overall importance of CAM in groups of health care professionals. Therefore, the primary objective was to analyse the knowledge about and use of CAM in an ethnically diverse student population at the London School of Pharmacy. METHODS A questionnaire was administered to students 264 completed questionnaires, response rate 59.1 and in-depth interviews were carried out with a sample of seven students. RESULTS Forty-three percent reported using at least one type of CAM during the last 12 months. The types of CAM used that were most frequently mentioned include aromatherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM and medicinal herbalism. TCM was reported by students of Chinese origin and by students from other ethnic backgrounds. However, Ayurvedic Indian medicine and medicine from Africa were only used in cultures from which the users originated. The study shows that a large number of herbal medical products were commonly reported by students of pharmacy. CONCLUSION The knowledge about and use of CAM is widespread among this group of future health care professionals and the students also expressed a strong interest in the topic. In-depth studies on the knowledge and use of CAM among other health care professionals and among ethnic minorities are urgently needed and may help to better manage the treatment of minor disorders as well as chronic diseases.","According to Knowledge and use of complementary and alternative medicine among British undergraduate pharmacy students, traditional Chinese Medicine TCM, aromatherapy, and medicinal herbalism were the most frequently used forms of complementary and alternative medicine CAM among London School of Pharmacy students.

"What are the health benefits of Ashwagandha, and how can I ensure its quality when purchasing it","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Withania somnifera L. Solanaceae, commonly known as Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng, is used in Ayurveda Indian system of traditional medicine for vitality, cardio-protection and treating other ailments, such as neurological disorders, gout, and skin diseases. AIM OF THE REVIEW We present a critical overview of the information on the metabolomics of W. somnifera and highlight the significance of the technique for use in quality control of medicinal products. We have also pointed out the use of metabolomics to distinguish varieties and to identify best methods of cultivation, collection, as well as extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS The relevant information on medicinal value, phytochemical studies, metabolomics of W. somnifera, and their applications were collected from a rigorous electronic search through scientific databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Structures of selected metabolites were from the PubChem. RESULTS The pharmacological activities of W. somnifera were well documented. Roots are the most important parts of the plant used in Ayurvedic preparations. Stem and leaves also have a rich content of bioactive phytochemicals like steroidal lactones, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. Metabolomic studies revealed that metabolite profiles of W. somnifera depended on plant parts collected and the developmental stage of the plant, besides the season of sample collection and geographical location. The levels of withanolides were variable, depending on the morphochemotypes within the species of W. somnifera. Although studies on W. somnifera were initiated several years ago, the complexity of secondary metabolites was not realized due to the lack of adequate and fool-proof technology for phytochemical fingerprinting. Sophistications in chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry facilitated the discovery of several new metabolites. Mutually complementary techniques like LC-MS, GC-MS, HPTLC, and NMR were employed to obtain a comprehensive metabolomic profile. Subsequent data analyses and searches against spectral databases enabled the annotation of signals and dereplication of metabolites in several numbers without isolating them individually. CONCLUSIONS The present review provides a critical update of metabolomic data and the diverse application of the technique. The identification of parameters for standardization and quality control of herbal products is essential to facilitate mandatory checks for the purity of formulation. Such studies would enable us to identify the best geographical location of plants and the time of collection. We recommend the use of metabolomic analysis of herbal products based on W. somnifera for quality control as well as the discovery of novel bioactive compounds.","According to Metabolomics of Withania somnifera L.

What types of alternative medicine might be used by patients with high blood pressure,"OBJECTIVE To study the prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and alternative medicine CAM in patients with essential hypertension. METHOD 521 consecutive patients visiting the Hypertension Clinic at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India, over a 6-month period were interviewed. Information was gathered on the patients demographics, types of CAM used, sequence of seeking CAM and conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons for opting for CAM and areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM. Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS It was observed that 63.9 of patients overall used CAM. Ayurveda was the most commonly used CAM 56.7, followed by herbal medicines 14.4. The most commonly cited reason by patients for using CAM was fear of adverse drug reactions of conventional medicines 59.0. However, more than half of the patients eventually became dissatisfied using CAM. Only 5.4 of CAM users had informed their medical doctors about the use of CAM. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of patients receiving conventional treatment for hypertension also use CAM therapies. A better understanding of the pattern of CAM use amongst these patients will help dispel prevalent misconceptions concerning CAM and, at the same time, assist conventional practitioners to critically evaluate possible gaps or omissions in their own prescribing habits.","According to Prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and alternative medicine CAM in hypertensive patients of a tertiary care center in India, a significant proportion 63.9 of patients with hypertension used complementary and alternative medicine CAM.

What are some ethical considerations in Ayurvedic medicine regarding conception and abortion,"Medical ethics in the Indian context is closely related to indigenous classical and folk traditions. This article traces the history of Indian conceptions of ethics and medicine, with an emphasis on the Hindu tradition. Classical Ayurvedic texts including Carakasamhita and Susrutasamhita provide foundational assumptions about the body, the self, and gunas, which provide the underpinnings for the ethical system. Karma, the notion that every action has consequences, provides a foundation for medical morality. Conception, prolongation of ones blood-line is an important ethical aim of life. Thus a wide range of practices to further conception are acceptable. Abortion is a more complex matter ethically. At the end of life death is viewed in the context of passage to another life. Death is a relief from suffering to be coped with by the thought of an eternal atman or rebirth.","According to Medical ethics in India, classical Ayurvedic texts like Carakasamhita and Susrutasamhita form the basis of Indian medical ethics. These texts provide assumptions about the body, the self, and gunas, which contribute to the ethical system. The concept of Karma, implying that every action has consequences, lays the foundation for medical morality in this context. Practices promoting conception are considered ethically acceptable due to the importance placed on the prolongation of ones bloodline. The view on abortion is more complex. In terms of end of life, death is viewed as a transition to another life and a relief from suffering, with coping mechanisms including the belief in an eternal atman or rebirth."
What natural remedies can help improve alertness and cognitive function as I age,"An ancient system of natural medicine--Maharishi Ayur-Vedic--prescribes certain herbal formulas to enhance cognitive functioning, prevent illness, and alleviate the detrimental effects of the aging process. A double-blind study was conducted to test the effect of an Ayurvedic herbal preparation, Maharishi Amrit Kalash MAK, on an age-related alertness task. Forty-eight men over 35 years of age were randomly assigned to receive MAK tablets or a closely matched placebo twice daily for six weeks. A visual discrimination task consisted of the identification of the exact location of a stimulus v within an array of x symbols in tachistoscopic presentations. The MAK group improved significantly more in their performance of this task after three and six weeks of treatment relative to the placebo group. Performance was highly correlated with age, and because successful performance apparently requires an unrestricted flow of homogeneous attention as well as focalized concentration, it is concluded that MAK may enhance attentional capacity or alertness, and thus reverse some of the detrimental cognitive effects of aging.","According to Influence of a Maharishi Ayur-vedic herbal preparation on age-related visual discrimination, the Ayurvedic remedy Maharishi Amrit Kalash MAK can potentially enhance cognitive functioning and mitigate the negative effects of aging. In a double-blind study, men over 35 years of age who took MAK tablets twice daily for six weeks showed significant improvements in an age-related alertness task compared to a placebo group. The task required attentional capacity and focalized concentration, suggesting that MAK may enhance these cognitive abilities and reverse some negative cognitive effects of aging."
Is it safe to use traditional Indian remedies considering the potential risks of heavy metal contamination,"The growing popularity of traditional Indian remedies necessitates a critical evaluation of risks associated with their use. This systematic review aims at summarising all available data relating to the heavy metal content in such remedies. Computerised literature searches were carried out to identify all articles with original data on this subject. Fifteen case reports and six case series were found. Their collective results suggest that heavy metals, particularly lead, have been a regular constituent of traditional Indian remedies. This has repeatedly caused serious harm to patients taking such remedies. The incidence of heavy metal contamination is not known, but one study shows that 64 of samples collected in India contained significant amounts of lead 64 mercury, 41 arsenic and 9 cadmium. These findings should alert us to the possibility of heavy metal content in traditional Indian remedies and motivate us to consider means of protecting consumers from such risks.","According to Heavy metals in traditional Indian remedies, traditional Indian remedies often contain heavy metals, particularly lead. One study found that 64 of samples collected in India contained significant amounts of lead, 64 contained mercury, 41 contained arsenic, and 9 contained cadmium.

What Ayurvedic herbs can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease,"BACKGROUND Ischemic heart disease IHD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developing and developed countries. An underlying cause of IHD involves retention and deposit of serum lipids in coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow. Drugs conventional and herbal are used to lower levels of serum cholesterol to help prevent IHD. The Ayurvedic medicine pharmacopoeia identified herbs that might contribute to a decrease in cholesterol and therefore reduce the risk of IHD. METHODS Literature searches were conducted at 3 points 2003, 2004, and 2007. Databases searched included PubMed, the National Library of Medicine, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Ovid, and EBSCO Information Services, and other search strategies also were used. Each article was assessed for quality by 3 people, and discrepancies were resolved by arbitration using a fourth person, who also read and scored each article. Additional assessments of safety using a scale and determination of reported efficacyeffectiveness of the randomized controlled trials RCTs and quasi-experimental designs QEDs were made. RESULTS RCTs generally received high quality scores and improved by decade of publication. More than 50 of garlic, more than 80 of guggul, and 100 of Arjuna RCTs reported product effectiveness. Safety scores did not improve by decade. The QEDs received medium and high quality scores, and 93 of them reported effectiveness. The QEDs had a higher mean score for safety reporting than the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS Many studies received high quality scores and noted safety information and reported effectiveness or efficacy in a clear manner. This finding was not consistent with other systematic reviews that have found the highest reported efficacy effectiveness in studies of poorer quality. Ayurvedic herbs reviewed here should be considered by physicians when trying to manage hyperlipidemia in their patients.","According to Ayurvedic and collateral herbal treatments for hyperlipidemia a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs, Ayurvedic herbs such as garlic, guggul, and Arjuna have shown effectiveness in reducing serum cholesterol levels and therefore could potentially reduce the risk of Ischemic heart disease.

Collected data from different sources was comprehensively summarizedanalyzed for ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, analytical chemistry, biological activities and toxicity studies of C. roseus. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION C. roseus has a wide range of applications in the traditional system of medicine especially in cancer and diabetes. During phytochemical investigation, total of 344 compounds including monoterpene indole alkaloids MIAs 110, bisindole alkaloids 35, flavonoids 34, phenolic acids 9 and volatile constituents 156 have been reported in the various extracts and fractions of different plant parts of C. roseus. The extracts and isolated compounds of C. roseus have to exhibit many pharmacological activities such as anticancercytotoxic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, larvicidal and pupicidal. The comparative toxicity of extracts and bioactive compounds investigated in dose dependent manner. The investigation of toxicity showed that the both extracts and isolated compounds are safe to a certain limit beyond that they cause adverse effects. CONCLUSION This review is a comprehensive, critically analyzed summarization of sufficient baseline information of selected topics in one place undertaken till date on C. roseus for future works and drug discovery. The phytochemical investigation including biosynthetic pathways showed that the MIAs and bisindole alkaloids are major and characteristic class of compounds in this plant. The present data confirm that the extractsfractions and their isolated alkaloids especially vinblastine 111 and vincristine 112 have a potent anticancercytotoxic and antidiabetic property and there is a need for further study with particular attention to the mechanisms of anticancer activity. In biosynthesis pathways of alkaloids especially bisindole alkaloids, some enzymes and rearrangement are unexposed therefore it is required to draw special attention. It also focuses on attracting the attention of scientific communities about the widespread biological activities of this species for its better utilization prospects in the near future.","According to Catharanthus roseus L.

Can Ayurvedic treatment help slow down the progression of chronic renal failure,"Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ayurvedic treatment on deceleration of the disease progress of nondialysis patients with stage IV or V chronic renal failure CRF. Materials and Methods A complex oral and proctocolonic Ayurvedic multiherbal medication was administered daily for 1 month to inpatients. Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral medication for additional 5 months. Four renal function tests RFTs were evaluated at various time points TPs 1 6 months before baseline TP -6, 2 at baseline TP 0, and 3 after completion of 6 months of treatment TP 6. Repeated-measures analysis of variance ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction and Friedmans ANOVA by ranks were used to analyze the RFTs. For post hoc tests, the Bonferroni correction was applied. Bias-corrected effect sizes Hedges for the treatment were calculated. Results Sixty-four nondialysis CRF patients with laboratory investigations of the preceding 6 months were included 12 patients discontinued the treatment. Fifty-two patients with stage IV or V at baseline completed the study. Mean concentrations of estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin differed significantly between TPs eGFR F 15.3, p 0.001 serum creatinine F 29.3, p 0.001 blood urea F 2.0, p 0.159 hemoglobin F 53.9, p 0.001. Pairwise comparisons of the mean differences between TPs are significant for eGFR, creatinine, and hemoglobin. For blood urea, a significant decrease was observed for the treatment period 15.9 mgdL, standard error 4.0 n 52, but a nonsignificant increase was observed for the pretreatment period 16.2 mgdL, standard error 9.8 due to insufficient data for TP -6 n 26. The effect sizes for eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin were medium 0.45, 0.53, 0.44, and 0.30. Conclusions After 6 months of treatment, statistically and clinically significant improvements of eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin and a significant shift to better CRF stages were observed. Several cardinal symptoms were also significantly reduced. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to evaluate the effects in comparison to usual care.","According to the paper Deceleration of Disease Progress Through Ayurvedic Treatment in Nondialysis Stages IV-V Patients with Chronic Renal Failure A Quasi-Experimental Clinical Pilot Study with One Group Pre- and Postdesign and Two Premeasurements, a complex oral and proctocolonic Ayurvedic multiherbal medication was administered daily for 1 month to inpatients. Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral medication for additional 5 months. After 6 months of treatment, statistically and clinically significant improvements of estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin and a significant shift to better chronic renal failure CRF stages were observed."
What are some traditional healing practices used by Khasi healers in India,"Despite decades of research on Indias plural health care market, the practices of many local health traditions outside the allopathic and codified traditions are under-studied. Drawing on interview and observational data, this paper explores the space in which indigenous traditional Khasi healers in Meghalaya state, northeast India, practice. Khasi indigenous healers describe themselves as doktor sla, plant doctors, to distinguish themselves from doktor kot, or book doctors. This distinction operates as a rhetorical resource, utilised to carve a distinct sphere of expertise in relation to the allopathic sector, and to mark claims for the specifically local appropriateness of traditional practices within a shifting market of state-sponsored provision. Khasi healers are a heterogeneous group who treat a wide variety of conditions, including physical ailments which have no obvious correlates in biomedical systems, and musculoskeletal disorders, with which they have recognised expertise. In addition to claiming these discrete strengths, healers also present themselves as accommodating deficiencies in biomedicine, including inherent generic weaknesses of allopathic care as well as specific local gaps in rural health care provision. Thus, the expertise niches of traditional healers have evolved through their interactions with, and the needs of, the community, but also through managing a shifting boundary with biomedical practitioners, who are explicitly sceptical of their efficacy, but tacitly accepting of the ways in which they manage the gaps in biomedical provision. While codified non-biomedical traditions in India have engaged in universalising professionalising projects, in this setting at least, non-codified practitioners have instead utilised discourses of localism.","According to Doktor Kot, Doktor Sla - book doctors, plant doctors and the segmentation of the medical market place in Meghalaya, northeast India, Khasi indigenous healers in Meghalaya, northeast India, refer to themselves as doktor sla, or plant doctors. These healers use traditional practices to treat a wide range of conditions, including physical ailments not easily correlated with biomedical systems and musculoskeletal disorders. In addition, they claim to accommodate deficiencies in biomedicine, addressing inherent weaknesses of allopathic care and local gaps in rural health care provision. These healers have developed their expertise through interactions with the community and through managing a shifting boundary with biomedical practitioners."

What Ayurvedic herbs or treatments are recommended for managing diabetes,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate and synthesize the evidence on the effect of Ayurvedic therapies for diabetes mellitus. DESIGN Systematic review of trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching journals in India were examined, yielding 54 articles reporting the results of 62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and Eugenia jambolana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush-82 and D-400 were most often studied. Thirty-five of the studies included came from the Western literature, 27 from the Indian. Seven were randomized controlled trials RCTs and 10 controlled clinical trials CCTs or natural experiments. Twenty-two studies went on to further analysis based on a set of criteria. Of these, 10 were RCTs, CCTs, or natural experiments, 12 were case series or cohort studies. There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil, fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 have a glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study. Evidence of effectiveness of several other herbs is less extensive C tamala, E jambolana, and Momordica charantia. CONCLUSIONS There is heterogeneity in the available literature on Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes. Most studies test herbal therapy. Heterogeneity exists in the herbs and formulas tested more than 44 different interventions identified and in the method of their preparation. Despite these limitations, there are sufficient data for several herbs or herbal formulas to warrant further studies.","According to Are Ayurvedic herbs for diabetes effective, the most commonly studied Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes is botanical therapy. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and Eugenia jambolana. Herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 were also frequently studied.

Other herbs such as C tamala, E jambolana, and Momordica charantia also showed potential as diabetes remedies but their effectiveness needs to be studied more extensively."
What are the potential risks of taking Ayurvedic or herbal medicines,"INTRODUCTION Lead poisoning is most commonly caused by occupational exposure. It presents with a myriad of signs and symptoms ranging from mild anemia to frank encephalopathy, depending on the blood lead levels as well as the duration of exposure. Intake of herbalAyurvedic medicine may also lead to plumbism as heavy metals are often incorporated in such medications with the belief that such metals have medicinal properties. METHODS We report a case of lead poisoning caused by Ayurvedic medication. The patient presented with symptoms of intestinal obstruction to the surgical casualty. RESULTS The patient presented with symptoms that mimicked intestinal obstruction. No specific etiology could be determined. Serum lead levels were determined and diagnosis of lead poisoning ascertained. The lead content of the medicine was analyzed and it contained 30 ww lead. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning consequent to intake of alternative medicine must be kept in mind when a patient presents with vague complaints.","According to Lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic drug presenting as intestinal obstruction a case report, the intake of certain Ayurvedic medicines may lead to lead poisoning, also known as plumbism. This is because heavy metals, which can include lead, are often incorporated into these medicines due to the belief that they have medicinal properties. In this particular case, the Ayurvedic medicine contained 30 ww lead. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential for heavy metal poisoning when consuming alternative medicines."
Can the seeds of D. biflorus help in preventing kidney stones,"In vitro effect of D. biflorus seeds on crystallization of calcium phosphate, a major constituent of kidney stone has been undertaken. There was a marked decrease in anticalcifying activity with the maturation of seeds or post-harvest storage for 6 months. The results suggested that the inhibitors of crystallization present in seed extract of D. biflorus were water soluble, heat stable, polar, non-tannin and non-protein in nature. There were two or more different inhibitors of calcium phosphate precipitation since both the dialysate and the dialysed fractions contained inhibitory activity, though it was more in the dialysed fractions. The anticalcifying activity was lost completely with activated charcoal which was not recovered or eluted by any solvent tried.","According to Anticalcifying properties of Dolichos biflorus horse gram seeds, the seeds of D. biflorus horse gram have been shown to have an in vitro effect on the crystallization of calcium phosphate, a major constituent of kidney stones. The inhibitory substances in the seed extract are water soluble, heat stable, polar, non-tannin and non-protein. However, the anticalcifying activity decreases with seed maturation or post-harvest storage for 6 months, and is completely lost with activated charcoal treatment. It was also observed that the dialysed fractions contained more inhibitory activity than the dialysate."

Is it safe to use Ayurvedic medicines and what are the risks of lead poisoning,"BACKGROUND Millions worldwide use Ayurvedic traditional Indian medicines. These medications are increasingly associated with lead poisoning, often accompanied by anemia. We compared the relative hematopoietic toxicity of Ayurvedic lead poisoning with a common form of occupational lead poisoning. MATERIALMETHODS We retrospectively studied 66 adult lead intoxications 43 published Ayurvedic cases identified in published reports by searching MEDLINE 1966 to November 2005 4 Ayurvedic patients seen at a referral center and 19 lead paint intoxications from the same center. We considered patients age, gender and blood lead at presentation, and then compared the groups with respect to hematopoietic parameters. RESULTS Ayurvedic lead poisoning was associated with higher blood lead p0.001, more basophilic stippling p0.001, lower hemoglobin p0.001 and higher protoporphyrin p0.001. Multiple regression adjusted for blood lead and gender found Ayurvedic lead poisoning associated with a 36.2 gL 95 CI -48.8, -23.6 gL greater decrement in hemoglobin p0.001 as compared to paint-removal poisoning. CONCLUSIONS Ayurvedic poisoning produces greater hematopoietic toxicity than paint-removal poisoning. Ayurvedic ingestion should be considered in patients with anemia. Ayurveda users should be screened for lead exposure and strongly encouraged to discontinue metal-containing remedies.","According to Hematopoietic toxicity from lead-containing Ayurvedic medications, Ayurvedic medicines, particularly those containing lead, can cause severe health issues, including lead poisoning and anemia.
