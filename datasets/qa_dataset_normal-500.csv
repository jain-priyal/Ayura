Can Ayurvedic practices influence our genes and improve overall health?,"Ayurveda is a comprehensive, natural health care system that originated in the  ancient Vedic times of India. Epigenetics refers to the external modification of  DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without  changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have  transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are  lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors.  Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti  (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and  indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus,  it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This  correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and  understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of  both sciences in the management of optimal health. In addition, research on  Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will further increase correlation  and understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda.","According to 'Ayurveda and Epigenetics', Ayurveda, an ancient comprehensive healthcare system, can affect gene expression without changing the DNA structure. This is done by addressing factors that cause epigenetic changes such as lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors. Ayurvedic practices can influence not just the body (Deha Prakriti) but also the birth traits (Janma Prakriti), thus integrating with the current medical systems for optimal health management. The paper also suggests that future research on Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will increase the understanding and correlation between Ayurveda and modern medicine."
How can integrating Ayurveda principles with modern biology help in managing diabetes?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with  complex multi-organ-multi-target crosstalk in the body. Currently, the  theoretical assumptions framing the diabetes management strategies are  reductionist and largely focus on reducing hyperglycemia through targeted  molecular drugs. While they effectively reduce hyperglycemia, they are  inadequate to address the multifactorial etiopathology, chronicity and systemic  complications of diabetes. Therefore, a holistic and systemic approach is  essential for its successful management. We hypothesize an integrative diabetes  management strategy, combining holistic principles of diabetes management with  its molecular understandings, would be more appropriate to fill this gap. The  holistic disease management principles of Ayurveda, the Indian system of  medicine, can play a pivotal role in this context. This narrative review  discusses the scope of a trans-disciplinary ' Ayurveda-Biology ' approach for  deepening the holistic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes as well  as designing novel integrative strategies for managing diabetes and restoring  whole body glucose homeostasis. METHODOLOGY: The article analyses the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management and  correlates it with the molecular understanding of its pathophysiology and  management. The sources of information used in this article include classical  texts of Ayurveda , medical books, published research articles and scientific  databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science-Direct, etc. RESULTS: While  Ayurveda and modern biomedicine uses different epistemology and ontology for  describing diabetes, both the systems recognize the central role of gut and gut  derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose  homeostasis. Essentially, the principles of both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine  overlap at a gut centred view of diabetes management; and Gastro-intestinal  mediated glucose disposal , a holistic concept of glucose metabolism, is  emerging as a converging node for designing innovative integrative diabetes  management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: An integrative disease management strategy, combining holistic and  reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively,  would be the prerogative for successful management of diabetes. Creating an '  Ayurveda-Biology' knowledge framework integrating the patient centred holistic  management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology  can give better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and  offer novel strategies for cost effective, holistic and multi-targeted  management of diabetes.","According to ""An 'Ayurveda-Biology' platform for integrative diabetes management"", the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management, which is a holistic and systemic approach, could be effectively combined with modern molecular understandings of diabetes for a more successful management strategy. This integrated approach focuses on the central role of the gut and gut-derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose homeostasis. Such a combination of the patient-centred holistic management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology could provide better insights into the biology of whole-body glucose homeostasis and offer innovative strategies for cost-effective, holistic, and multi-targeted management of diabetes."
How can Ayurveda be used in managing and treating epilepsy?,"Epilepsy, a chronic non-communicable disease of the brain, is one of the most  common neurological diseases globally that affects people of all ages. The  existence of medical, neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive comorbidities has  always undermined the available advanced treatment strategies for epilepsy.  New-generation antiepileptic drugs being less successful in completely  controlling the seizures and observance of complex diseases, including  drug-resistant cases, have provided scope for integrating and incorporating the  therapeutic modalities of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian art of holistic medicine,  in the effective management of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara,  described in the classics of Ayurveda as the transient appearance of  unconsciousness with loathsome expression due to derangement of memory,  intelligence, and mind. The multifaceted therapeutic approach of Ayurveda, which  involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying  procedures, herbal and herbo-mineral formulations, disease, and host-specific  approaches, have enhanced the potential of not only relieving symptoms but also  modifying the pathophysiology of the disease. Newer paradigms of research in  Ayurveda, along with holistic and integrative approaches with contemporary  medicine, can not only benefit the existing healthcare system but also impact  future healthcare management in epileptology research. This cursory literature  review is an earnest attempt to identify, evaluate, and summarize various  studies and provide a comprehensive insight into the potential of Ayurveda in  understanding and treating epilepsy.","According to ""Ayurveda therapy in the management of epilepsy"", epilepsy can be correlated to Apasmara, a condition described in Ayurveda. The Ayurvedic approach to managing epilepsy involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, purificatory and pacifying procedures, and the use of herbal and herbo-mineral formulations. The approach is also disease and host-specific, aiming not only to relieve symptoms but also to modify the pathophysiology of the disease. Integrating Ayurvedic therapeutic modalities with contemporary medicine can potentially benefit the existing healthcare system and influence future healthcare management in epileptology research."

What are the key contributions of Ayurveda to our understanding of digestion and metabolism?,"Ayurveda is a traditional system of healthcare that is native to India and has a  rich documented literature of its own. Most of the historians agree that the  documentation of core Ayurveda literature took place approximately in between  400 BCE and 200 CE, while acknowledging that the roots of its theoretical  framework can be traced back to a much earlier period. For multiple reasons many  significant contributions of Ayurveda literature to various streams of  biological and medical sciences have remained under-recognized while recounting  the historical milestones of development. This is true in the context of the  physiology of digestion and metabolism too. In this communication we try to  reconstruct a picture of the processes of digestion and metabolism as had been  understood by ancient Ayurveda scholars. Though this understanding was primitive  and insufficient in many ways, we argue that this deserves to be documented and  acknowledged. To help with grasping the importance of these contributions, we  juxtapose them with the corresponding insights pertaining to this subject  reported by prominent western scientists. The major contributions of Ayurveda  that have been recounted in this paper are those related to the description of  three distinct phases of digestion (Avasthapaka), multiple sets of  transformative entities acting at different levels of metabolism (Agni), and the  roles ascribed to various internal and external factors in executing these  physiological functions.","According to ""Overlooked contributions of Ayurveda literature to the history of physiology of digestion and metabolism"", the key Ayurvedic remedies related to digestion and metabolism involve the understanding of three distinct phases of digestion, referred to as Avasthapaka in Ayurveda.

The Ayurvedic literature also acknowledges the roles of various internal and external factors in executing these physiological functions."
What are some Ayurvedic practices that can help improve cognitive function and prevent aging?,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, included geriatrics as 1 of 8  medical divisions. Well-documented evidence exists for treating aging and  age-related disorders including dementia. Geriatrics was termed Rasayanatantra.  Cognitive function was well recognized and Sanskrit terms existed such as Buddhi  for intelligence and Cittanasa (Citta means mind, nasa means loss of) for  dementia. A normal human life span was considered to be 100 years. It could be  prolonged to 116-120 years through the use of preventive treatments, if they  were started during late youth or middle age. Treatments included herbal  preparations, diet, exercise, and attention to general mode of life and social  behavior. Several herbal formulations are described, including details of their  composition and preparation. The mode of action of antiaging drugs was believed  to occur at 3 levels. Detailed descriptions of the mode of action of several  herbs are provided, and recent research confirms some of this activity.","According to 'Dementia in Ayurveda', Ayurvedic treatments for aging and age-related disorders like dementia include herbal preparations, diet, exercise, and attention to general lifestyle and social behavior.

Can Ayurvedic treatments be effective in relieving symptoms of conjunctivitis?,"BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva. Although data  on clinical efficacy and safety of various ayurvedic treatments in  conjunctivitis is published, systematic review is not done. This systematic  review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ayurvedic  treatments in conjunctivitis. METHODS: A literature search of the Cochrane Library (Cochrane central register  of controlled trials: issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Pub Med, AYUSH research portal  (Govt. of India), DHARA portal, Google scholar and online clinical trials  registers was done. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized  controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and multiple arms  clinical trials were identified in which Ayurveda treatments with any dose,  type, schedule, drug, dosage form, and advised Pathayapathya (lifestyle changes)  were selected. RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, five CCTs and two multiple arms  clinical trials which includes a total of 816 participants. Meta analysis of  data from five trials showed that ayurvedic treatments benefitted more compared  with non-ayurveda interventions in symptoms like itching (SMD = -0.98, 95% CI  (-1.30,-0.65) p < 0.00001, I2 = 38%), pain (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI (-0.87, -0.29,  P = 0.0001, I2 = 0%), ropy discharge (SMD = -1.02, 95% CI(-1.45, -0.59),  P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), conjunctival congestion (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-0.91,  -0.43), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%), foreign body sensation (SMD = -0.68, 95%  CI(-1.06, -0.29), p = 0.0006, I2 = 46%, Fig. 8) and lid heaviness (SMD = -0.66,  95% CI(- 0.98, -0.33), p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Although some findings confirm the benefit of ayurveda as opposed  to non ayurveda for the treatment of conjunctivitis, since the studies have high  risk of bias and are of lower quality, the findings could not be generalized.  There is a need for high quality studies in ayurveda in this regard.

What are some Ayurvedic practices for maintaining oral hygiene naturally?,"Ayurveda recommends sound and healthy life. It basically focuses on prevention  rather than treatment. It includes a systematic lifestyle pattern which is  composed of several principles and activities. Dinacharya (Daily routine) is one  of the important principles. It includes various activities started from just  before sunrise. All these activities are necessary for the maintenance of  homeostasis of the body. Tooth brushing is one of the essential routines of  Ayurveda daily practices. Traditionally it has been advocated with a soft twig  of medicinal plants with or without herbal tooth powder. There are so many  medicinal plants have been described in this context. Contradictory plants have  also been described. Oral hygiene products are so much advanced and globalized  nowadays. There are so many types of toothbrushes; dentifrices, dental floss,  tongue scrapers, mouthwashes, oral irrigators, etc. are available along with  specifications. Contemporary oral hygiene products esp. dentifrices are  chemically rich and have their own side effects. No doubt these products have  their own advantages like easy availability and adjustability according to  current lifestyle. But their safety is questionable on long-term use. Herbal  products have additional benefits over it that those are natural and easily  adjustable and acceptable with body physiology.","According to 'A review on traditional practice of tooth brushing in Ayurveda and its relevance in current era', Ayurveda recommends maintaining oral hygiene through tooth brushing as part of its daily routine principle, Dinacharya. The traditional Ayurvedic practice advocates for tooth brushing with a soft twig from medicinal plants, with or without herbal tooth powder. While modern oral hygiene products offer convenience, they are chemically rich and may have side effects with long-term use. On the other hand, herbal products align with natural body physiology and are considered safer for long-term use."

What are some Ayurvedic methods for managing psychiatric conditions?,"The ancient medicine of India (ayurveda) is a broadly conceptualized  anthropology embracing the whole human being without the Western body/soul  dualism. A symptomatology based on careful observation leads, in conjunction  with etiology, pathogenesis and pathology, with constitutional and personality  features, to a differentiated nosology. This broad concept is matched by  multidimensional therapy embracing pharmacologic, surgical, psychotherapeutic  and ""paramedical"" measures. Ayurveda (""life knowledge"") is a combination of  religious, philosophical, anthropological, medical and psychological concepts.  It is impressive how accurate the knowledge and description of psychiatric  diseases already was 2,500 years ago, and how little these phenomena have  changed with time. The therapeutic armamentarium (paramedical, psychotherapeutic  and pharmacologic) of ayurveda psychiatry has not yet been sufficiently studied  by scientific methods.","According to [Ayurveda], the ancient Indian medicine system uses a multidimensional approach to treatment that includes pharmacologic, surgical, psychotherapeutic and ""paramedical"" measures.

How can Ayurveda help manage food allergies and intolerances?,"Food allergy being a common health problem needs attention. The experience of  Ayurveda can be utilized to accelerate our understanding and management of food  allergies and related phenomenon like allergic tension fatigue syndrome,  intolerance and indigestion associated with certain foods. Prevention of food  allergies by carefully selecting the foods in accordance with the individual's  body constitution and seasonal alterations, is considered as the best strategy  in Ayurveda. If possible, the concept of prakriti and properties of food as  described in Ayurveda, should be interpreted in modern terminology. Moreover, to  scientifically validate them, an appropriate correlation with modern concepts is  required along with scientific studies on modern parameters. Rasayanas may also  prove helpful in the management of food allergies. It is obvious that there, is  an urgent need for multidimensional and planned investigations of these  Ayurvedic rasayanas in management of food allergies. The clinical acceptability  of rasayanas for the treatment of food allergies entirely rests on such studies.  Food intolerance and allergies are common health problems which are difficult to  diagnose and still more difficult to treat. This problem is well addressed in  Ayurveda and guidelines are available for their management. This paper aims to  present the Ayurvedic concepts in the management of food intolerance/ allergies  and its correlation with the evidences available from modem scientific  laboratories. The understanding of this ancient wisdom may prove to be of  immense importance in patient care.","According to ""Food allergies--leads from Ayurveda"", the Ayurvedic approach to managing food allergies includes the careful selection of foods in accordance with the individual's body constitution and seasonal alterations. The paper suggests the interpretation of Ayurvedic concepts of prakriti and food properties in modern terminology to enhance understanding and management of food allergies. Additionally, the use of Ayurvedic rasayanas, or rejuvenating treatments, may also be beneficial in managing food allergies. However, the clinical acceptability of these rasayanas must be supported by scientific studies. The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding this ancient wisdom for patient care."
Can Ayurveda provide any insights into the functioning of the cardiovascular system?,"Ayurveda, the native healthcare system of India, is a rich resource of  well-documented ancient medical knowledge. Although the roots of this knowledge  date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a  dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between  400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these  early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among  the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda  have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine.  In this communication, the discovery of blood circulation has been taken up as a  case, and a few important references from the representative Ayurveda compendia  that hint at a preliminary understanding of the cardiovascular system as a  ""closed circuit"" and the heart acting as a pump have been reviewed. The central  argument of this review is that these contributions from Ayurveda too must be  recorded and credited when reviewing the milestones in the history of medicine,  as Ayurveda can still possibly guide various streams of the current sciences, if  revisited with this spirit.","According to ""The history of the discovery of blood circulation: unrecognized contributions of Ayurveda masters"", Ayurvedic texts contain references that suggest an early understanding of the cardiovascular system as a ""closed circuit"" and the heart acting as a pump.

What are some plant species used in traditional Indian health care systems that could improve overall health?,"Biodiversity of natural resources has served not only for the primary human  needs but also for health care, since time immemorial. The Indian subcontinent,  with the history of one of the oldest civilization, harbors many traditional  health care systems. Their development was supported by the diverse biodiversity  in flora and fauna due to variations in geographical landscaping. Ayurveda,  whose history goes back to 5000 b.c., is one of the ancient health care systems.  The Ayurveda was developed through daily life experiences with the mutual  relationship between mankind and nature. The ancient text of Ayurveda reports  more than 2000 plant species for their therapeutic potentials. Besides Ayurveda,  other traditional and folklore systems of health care were developed in the  different time periods in Indian subcontinent, where more than 7500 plant  species were used. According to a WHO estimate, about 80% of the world  population relies on traditional systems of medicines for primary health care,  where plants form the dominant component over other natural resources. Renewed  interest of developing as well as developed countries in the natural resources  has opened new horizons for the exploration of natural sources with the  perspectives of safety and efficacy. The development of these traditional  systems of medicines with the perspectives of safety, efficacy and quality will  help not only to preserve this traditional heritage but also to rationalize the  use of natural products in the health care. Until recent past, the nature was  considered as a compendium for templates of new chemical entities (NCEs).

What are some ways to increase public awareness about the benefits of Ayurveda?,"Background Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine, has been practised in India  since ages. We evaluated the overall awareness regarding Ayurveda among patients  attending two specialty clinics at a tertiary care institute. Methods We did a  cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics  at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using  a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed  using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed  to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among  them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that  Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations  (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%).  Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and  newspaper advertisements (13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined  that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of  participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be  beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had  Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to  participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine.  Conclusion Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail  in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed. We found imprecise  knowledge of Ayurvedic therapies and its low usage among patients attending  specialized OPDs in a tertiary care hospital. The major source of information  reported was promotional advertisements in the print and electronic media.

How can Ayurgenomics help improve my mental and physical health through personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations?,"Within the disciplines of modern medicine, P4 medicine is emerging as a new  field which focuses on the whole patient. The development of Ayurgenomics could  greatly enrich P4 medicine by providing a clear theoretical understanding of the  whole patient and a practical application of ancient and modern preventative and  therapeutic practices to improve mental and physical health. One of the most  difficult challenges today is understanding the ancient concepts of Ayurveda in  terms of modern science. To date, a number of researchers have attempted this  task, of which one of the most successful outcomes is the creation of the new  field of Ayurgenomics. Ayurgenomics integrates concepts in Ayurveda, such as  Prakriti, with modern genetics research. It correlates the combination of three  doshas, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, with the expression of specific genes and  physiological characteristics. It also helps to interpret Ayurveda as an ancient  science of epigenetics which assesses the current state of the doshas, and uses  specific personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations to improve a patient's  health. This review provides a current update of this emerging field.","According to ""Ayurgenomics and Modern Medicine"", Ayurgenomics is a new field that integrates concepts in Ayurveda, like Prakriti, with modern genetics research.

What factors might lead someone to seek Ayurveda treatment in India for chronic conditions?,"In the past two decades, health care has become a global market and  transnational practice. An emerging body of literature examines the astounding  variety of drivers, conditions, and experiences. However, the question of how  traveling abroad for treatment emerges as an option and takes shape in people's  illness trajectories has gained little attention thus far. This article attends  to this gap by following the stories of people with chronic conditions who  travel to India for Ayurveda treatment out of dissatisfaction with local  biomedical health care. This study expands the focus of current research on  transnational therapeutic mobilities in three ways: (1) by shifting the  attention from being a foreign patient or medical traveler to becoming one, (2)  by integrating quests for other-than-biomedical therapies, and (3) by applying a  narrative approach to the field. Results show that apart from social, human, and  financial resources, it takes certain patient-subjectivities to mobilize  patients across borders and healing systems.","According to ""Of odysseys and miracles: A narrative approach on therapeutic mobilities for ayurveda treatment"", individuals with chronic conditions are seeking Ayurvedic treatment in India due to dissatisfaction with local biomedical healthcare. However, the study suggests that apart from having the necessary social, human, and financial resources, it requires a certain mindset or patient-subjectivity to engage in such transnational therapeutic mobility."
What lifestyle changes can I make according to Ayurveda to lead a healthier life?,"Brahmavaivartapurana is one of the important Mahapurana, which is considered as  a Vaisnavapurana. The text is divided into four parts called khanda i.e.,  Brahma, Prakrti, Ganapati, and Srikrsnajanmakhanda. The total number of chapters  are 276 and comprising about 20,500 verses. Brahmavaivartapurana comprises both  ancient and medieval materials.

An account of the Jvara (Fever) and other  diseases, Dinacarya (daily routine), Rtucarya (seasonal regimen), Tridosa (three  humours), their Prakopa (Vitiation) and Praśamana (palliation) etc are described  in this book. BVP deals with the do's and dont's of food intake, sleep and  sexual indulgance in detail which are deemed to be Trayopastambha (three sub  pillers of health). The book provides an account of Plant Tulsi's origin and its  spiritual importance. Prakrti (nature's) origins, Pañcamahabhuta nature of the  body are described in Prakrtikhanda. At the flag end of the book there is a  legend describing the origin of Lord Dhanvantari and describes his scholarship  in the field of Veda and śastra. On the whole purana provides glimpse of the  life style of a Vaisnava devoutee and the people of the time when it was  compiled. It serves the purpose of a practical manual to lead a healthy life and  ensure spiritual growth in the life of any individual who believes in the  precepts of this book.","According to ""A review of Brahmavaivartapurana (BVP) with reference to Ayurveda"", the Brahmavaivartapurana text provides detailed accounts of Ayurvedic practices.

It provides guidance on managing food intake, sleep, sexual indulgence, and highlights the importance of the plant Tulsi and its spiritual significance. It also refers to the origin of Lord Dhanvantari,"
What does Ayurveda say about determining the sex of a baby at conception?,"As a curious undergraduate studying Ayurveda, the first concept that intrigued  me was Sushruta's take on foetal sex determination. At the time of conception,  if the man's semen is in excess, a male foetus results; if the woman's menstrual  blood is in excess, a female foetus results; if semen and menstrual blood are in  equal measure, an intersex is formed.","According to ""Give truth a chance"", Sushruta's Ayurvedic concept suggests that the sex of a foetus is determined at conception. If the man's semen is in excess, a male foetus results; if the woman's menstrual blood is in excess, a female foetus results; if semen and menstrual blood are in equal measure, an intersex is formed."
How can participating in an Ayurvedic program like Panchakarma help improve my health behaviors?,"Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India, is understudied in western  contexts. Using data gathered from an Ayurvedic treatment program, this study  examined the role of psychosocial factors in the process of behavior change and  the salutogenic process. This observational study examined associations with  participation in the 5-day Ayurvedic cleansing retreat program, Panchakarma.  Quality of life, psychosocial, and behavior change measurements were measured  longitudinally on 20 female participants. Measurements were taken before the  start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram.  The program did not significantly improve quality of life. Significant  improvements were found in self-efficacy towards using Ayurveda to improve  health and reported positive health behaviors. In addition, perceived social  support and depression showed significant improvements 3 months postprogram  after the subjects had returned to their home context. As a program of behavior  change, our preliminary results suggest that the complex intervention  Panchakarma may be effective in assisting one's expected and reported adherence  to new and healthier behavior patterns.","According to ""Ayurveda and Panchakarma: measuring the effects of a holistic health intervention"", the Ayurvedic treatment program, Panchakarma, was observed to significantly improve self-efficacy towards using Ayurveda to improve health and positive health behaviors.

These results suggest that Panchakarma may be effective in supporting adherence to new, healthier behavior patterns."
What kind of health advice can be found in the Buddhist literature?,"The Păli canon consists of three Pitakas (baskets), which replete the Buddhism  and is known as Tripiţaka, viz, Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma Piţakas. The  original phase of Tripiţaka (Buddhisim started in 544 B.C. and lastly  systematized up to 29 B.C. The Buddhist literature also possesses the esoteric  material of Medical Science, which is practiced and conserved in India since  centuries. It refers to the fundamentals of medicine, rules of good living,  which lay considerable emphasis on the hygiene of body, mind. Internal Medicine,  curative medicine including symptoms, methods of diagnosis, theories of  causation, materia-medica, therapeutics and treatment and skills of Jivaka. Some  famous and popular prescriptions are also dealt with.","According to ""Ayurvĕda gleaned through Buddhism"", the Păli canon, a key Buddhist text, contains significant medical information.

What is the Ayurvedic approach to balancing mental and physical health?,"Ayurveda, the science of life, is a comprehensive medical system that has been  the traditional system of healthcare in India for more than 5000 years. This  medical system was well established around 2500 to 600 BC, when it evolved into  2 schools: the School of Physicians and the School of Surgeons, similar to  allopathy. Charak Samhita, Susrut Samhita, and Ashtang Hridaya Samhita are the  Senior Triad texts, and Madhav Nidan Samhita, Sarangdhar Samhita, and  Bhavprakash Samhita are the Junior Triad texts. Around 600 BC. Ayurveda was  branched into internal medicine; pediatrics; psychiatry; surgery; eye, ear,  nose, and throat; toxicology; geriatrics; and eugenics/aphrodisiacs. The body is  composed of 3 body doshas, 3 mental doshas, 7 dhatus, and malas. The harmony  among the body doshas of vata (nervous system), pitta (enzymes), and kapha  (mucus) and the gunas, or mental doshas (which are human attributes: satogun  [godly], rajas [kingly], and tamas [evil]), constitutes health, and their  disharmony constitutes disease. The management of illness requires balancing the  doshas back into a harmonious state through lifestyle interventions, spiritual  nurturing, and treatment with herbo-mineral formulas based on one's mental and  bodily constitution.","According to 'Ayurveda: a historical perspective and principles of the traditional healthcare system in India', Ayurvedic remedy is centred on the concept of balancing body doshas (nervous system, enzymes, mucus) and mental doshas (human attributes: godly, kingly, evil) for maintaining health. Any imbalance in these doshas constitutes disease. The management of illness in Ayurveda involves bringing these doshas back into harmony through lifestyle interventions, spiritual nurturing, and treatment with herbo-mineral formulas that are tailored to an individual's mental and bodily constitution."
What is Ayurveda and how can it contribute to maintaining a healthy lifestyle?,"Modern medical science is currently in the throes of a revolution which is  likely to have a dramatic impact on both the theory of medicine and the way it  is practised. The mechanistic model which served biomedicine well for many years  is gradually collapsing, thanks to the efforts of dedicated researchers who have  looked beyond that model's flaws. Thus we now know that networks of chemical  communication exist between the nervous and immune systems, and that prayer at a  distance can positively affect the conditions of those who are seriously ill,  even when the prayer and the patient are not known to one another. Another  participant in this exciting climate of change and ferment is Ayurveda, India's  ancient medical system. While Ayurveda has already contributed much to modern  medicine (reserpine, gugulipid, plastic surgery), its real contributions are yet  to be made. While some of these are likely to come in matters of materia medica  and technique, most will likely be derived from Ayurveda's way of seeing the  world, its ""darshana."" This paper outlines a few of the ways in which Ayurveda's  ""vision"" is likely to facilitate medicine's ability to teach people not just how  to avoid disease but how to proactively develop and maintain a healthy ""state.""","According to ""Ayurveda's role in preventing disease"", Ayurveda, an ancient medical system from India, is predicted to make significant contributions to modern medicine. These contributions are not only expected to be in terms of materia medica and technique but also in terms of Ayurveda's approach or ""darshana"" towards viewing the world. The Ayurvedic approach is considered to have the potential to improve medicine's ability to educate people not only on disease prevention but also on proactive development and maintenance of a healthy state."
How can Ayurvedic formulations like Triphala potentially be used in cancer treatment?,"Network pharmacology is an emerging technique, which integrates systems biology  and computational biology to study multi-component and multi-targeted  formulations. Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, uses  intelligent formulations; however, their scientific rationale and mechanisms  remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the potential of network  pharmacology to understand the rationale of a commonly used Ayurveda formulation  known as Triphala. We have developed pharmacology networks of Triphala based on  the information gathered from different databases and using the software  Cytoscape. The networks depict the interaction of bioactives with molecular  targets and their relation with diseases, especially cancer. The network  pharmacology analysis of Triphala has offered new relationships among  bioactives, targets and putative applications of cancer etiology. This  pioneering effort might open new possibilities to know pharmacodynamics of  Ayurvedic drugs like Triphala and also help in the discovery of new leads and  targets for various diseases.","According to 'Network Pharmacology of Ayurveda Formulation Triphala with Special Reference to Anti-Cancer Property', the Ayurveda formulation Triphala shows potential in cancer treatment. This conclusion is drawn from a network pharmacology analysis, which maps the interaction of Triphala's bioactives with molecular targets related to diseases, particularly cancer. This study suggests that understanding the pharmacodynamics of Ayurvedic drugs like Triphala could lead to the discovery of new treatments for various diseases."
Can Ayurvedic medicine be used in the treatment of cancer?,"An integrated approach is needed to manage cancer using the growing body of  knowledge gained through scientific developments. Thousands of herbal and  traditional compounds are being screened worldwide to validate their use as  anti-cancerous drugs. The science of Ayurveda is supposed to add a step on to  the curative aspects of cancers that have resemblance with clinical entities of  arbuda and granthi mentioned in Sushrutha samhita. Hence, an attempt is made in  this review to discuss about the pathology and therapeutic management of various  cancers described in Ayurveda. Review of literature on anticancer drugs of plant  origin revealed identification of newer ayurvedic drugs that are not mentioned  in the ancient texts. These new findings add up to ayurvedic science that has  been developed through ages. In addition, details of experimental and clinical  studies conducted on single and compound ayurvedic preparations for their  anticancer efficacy strongly emphasize ayurvedic therapy as a scientifically  driven one and not simply unconventional.","According to 'Cancer--an ayurvedic perspective', an integrated approach using Ayurvedic science can contribute to cancer management. The study highlights the potential of herbal and traditional compounds in acting as anti-cancerous drugs. Moreover, the review discusses the pathology and therapeutic management of various cancers described in Ayurveda and emphasizes the anticancer efficacy of both single and compound ayurvedic preparations. The study also identifies new Ayurvedic drugs not mentioned in ancient texts, demonstrating the ongoing development and scientific validation of Ayurvedic science."

Can Ayurvedic treatments help reduce symptoms of knee osteoarthritis?,"OBJECTIVE: Ayurveda is commonly used in South Asia to treat knee osteoarthritis  (OA). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment compared to  conventional conservative care in patients with knee OA. METHOD: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria knee OA  patients were included in a multicenter randomized, controlled, open-label trial  and treated in 2 hospital clinics and 2 private outpatient clinics in Germany.  Participants received either a multi-modal Ayurvedic treatment or multi-modal  conventional care with 15 treatments over 12 weeks respectively. Primary outcome  was the change on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis  (WOMAC) Index after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales; the  pain disability index and a pain experience scale, numeric rating scales for  pain and sleep quality, quality-of-life and mood, rescue medication use, and  safety issues. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one participants (Ayurveda n = 77, conventional care  n = 74) were included. Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were  more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95%CI: 52.4;69.6])  than in the conventional group (32.0 [95%CI: 21.4;42.6]) resulting in a  significant between-group difference (p < 0.001) and a clinically relevant  effect size (Cohen's d 0.68 [95% CI:0.35;1.01]). Similar trends were observed  for all secondary outcomes at week 12. Effects were sustained at follow-ups  after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that Ayurvedic treatment is beneficial in reducing  knee OA symptoms. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the magnitude  of the effect and to clarify the role of different treatment components and  non-specific effects.

What are the benefits of using a problem-based learning approach in Ayurveda education?,"Objectives: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a well-known student-centered  instructional approach that is known to enhance problem-solving skills among the  learners. Because teaching/learning methods in most of the Ayurveda colleges in  India are still didactic and teacher centric, the effects of introducing PBL  have not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to develop  PBL modules for Kriya Sharira (Ayurveda Physiology) and their implementation in  a hybrid format. In this method, PBL is used as an add-on component along with  didactic lectures. The secondary objective of the study was to compare the  learning outcomes achieved through hybrid problem-based learning (HPBL) with  those achieved through conventional teaching. Design: This is a prospectively  planned post-test-only, controlled interventional design with nonequivalent  groups. However, the results have been analyzed in a retrospective manner.  Subjects: Students enrolled in the first professional Bachelor of Ayurvedic  Medicine and Surgery program during two consecutive academic sessions 2016-2017  and 2017-2018 at the Banaras Hindu University were included in the study. While  the cohort from 2016 to 2017 session served as the control group, the one from  2017 to 2018 session served as the experimental group. Interventions: The  instructional method commonly known as HPBL was introduced to the experimental  group. Outcome measures: Five test papers containing mostly Multiple Choice  Questions for five different topics were used as the tools for evaluating the  learning outcomes in both the groups. Feedback forms regarding the experiences  of undergoing HPBL were obtained from experimental group. Results: While the  test results for three topics showed that the outcomes of HPBL were comparable  with conventional teaching, the results on other two topics suggested that HPBL  was slightly better. Feedback obtained showed that there is a considerable  acceptance for HPBL over conventional method. Conclusions: The study shows that  it is possible to implement HPBL method in a large classroom in the context of  Ayurveda education. The findings also indicate that students find HPBL as an  acceptable teaching method.","According to ""Introducing Hybrid Problem-Based Learning Modules in Ayurveda Education: Results of an Exploratory Study"", the use of Hybrid Problem-Based Learning (HPBL) in Ayurveda education, particularly in the area of Kriya Sharira (Ayurveda Physiology), has been studied.

Can traditional medical systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine provide a more personalized approach to health and wellness?,"The hot-cold concept is the basis of various traditional medical systems that is  expressed under distinct headings, such as Mizaj and the four humors in Persian  Medicine, Yin and Yang in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Tridoṣa ('Vāta',  'Pitta', and 'Kapha') in Ayurveda. Conventional medicine is facing a growing  demand for personalized medicine. Therefore, clear and comprehensible  information on the foundations and descriptions of traditional medicines, which  take the personalized approach toward maintaining health, prevention and  treatment of the diseases, may help to accelerate this process. This chapter  will explain the physiologic basis of the hot-cold theory in traditional medical  systems via a review of recent studies.","According to ""Hot and Cold Theory: Evidence in Physiology"", the Ayurvedic concept of Tridoṣa, which includes 'Vāta', 'Pitta', and 'Kapha', is a key principle in traditional medical systems that take a personalized approach to maintaining health and preventing and treating diseases.

How can incorporating a variety of plant foods in my diet help improve my gut health and potentially prevent chronic diseases?,"Diet provides macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), micronutrients  (vitamins and minerals), and phytochemicals (non-nutrient bioactive compounds).  Emerging evidence suggests that above dietary components can directly impact the  composition and metabolic activity of the mammalian gut microbiota and in turn,  affect both physical and mental health. There is a growing recognition that rise  in chronic disease burden in Western countries may due to progressive loss of  beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity. This perspective explores the  possibility of using Indian thali, an ancient approach to diet that provides  both fiber and different phytochemicals by incorporating a variety of plant  foods in different colors. This variety helps to restore diversity in the gut  bacteria and may potentially prevent or reverse chronic disease, such as colon  cancer or type 2 diabetes.","According to 'Ancient Thali Diet: Gut Microbiota, Immunity, and Health', the Indian Thali diet, an ancient dietary approach that includes a variety of plant foods of different colors, provides both fiber and different phytochemicals.

How can Ayurveda help manage arthritis symptoms?,"The fundamental principles of Ayurveda are briefly reviewed. The ancient  classification of arthritis is described along with the comparisons to the  modern system. Though the diagnosis is historical and clinical, it is based on  the tridosha hypothesis. The Ayurvedic pathogenesis links arthritis to the gut.  Management chiefly consists of diet and lifestyle changes, the panchkarma  process, and herbal drugs. The rasayana concept of immunomodulation is  introduced. Clinical ethno-validation of the ancient therapy is necessary to  meet the modern requirements and set up an interface with modern medicine.","According to ""Ayurvedic medicine and arthritis"", the Ayurvedic remedy for arthritis primarily includes diet and lifestyle modifications, the panchkarma process, and the use of herbal drugs.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments that can help improve symptoms and quality of life for dementia patients?,"Dementia has been characterized by atypical neurological syndromes and several  cognitive deficits, such as extended memory loss, strange behavior, unusual  thinking, impaired judgment, impotence, and difficulty with daily living  activities. Dementia is not a disease, but it is caused by several  neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lewy's bodies.  Several drugs and remedies are indicated for alleviating unusual cognitive  decline, but no effective pharmacological treatment regimens are available  without side effects. Herbal drugs or traditional medicines like Ayurveda have  been known for facilitating and corroborating the balance between mind, brain,  body, and environment. Ayurvedic therapy comprises 600 herbal formulas, 250  single plant remedies, and natural and holistic health-giving treatments that  relieve dementia in patients and increase vitality. Ayurvedic Rasayana herbs  [rejuvenating elements] strengthen the brain cells, enhance memory, and decrease  stress. The current medicine scenario in the treatment of dementia has prompted  the shift in exploring the efficacy of ayurvedic medicine, its safety, and its  efficiency.

How does Ayurveda adapt to meet the changing health needs of society in Sri Lanka?,"This paper argues that because Ayurveda is commonly approached as a single  coherent tradition of medicine characterized predominately by the doctrines,  clinical practitioners, and medical infrastructure that supports it, the rich  diversity of empirical indigenous medicine available in the daily lives of the  Sinhalese is often obscured. Thus the numbers of IMPs, the wide range of  services they provide, and the importance of Ayurveda and Sinhala medicine as  basic explanatory models of health and illness within the general population may  be significantly under-estimated in analyses of Sri Lanka's medical system. In  practice, Ayurveda is a dynamic phenomenon that offers multifaceted approaches  to healing. These diverse healing formats develop to meet the constantly  changing needs of the society and of illness patterns. This analysis views  illness and health care in terms of the multiple systems of knowledge and  action, phenomena and interaction, that characterize them as well as in terms of  the medical treatises and institutions that formalize them. In this light,  Ayurveda emerges as a plural medical system in itself. As such, it remains a  fundamental means of defining and treating illness in Sri Lanka.","According to 'Exploring pluralism--the many faces of Ayurveda', Ayurveda is not a single, rigid system but rather a dynamic and multifaceted tradition of medicine. It offers diverse healing approaches that adapt to meet changing societal and health needs. The paper suggests that the importance of Ayurveda and Sinhala medicine as fundamental models of health and illness within the general population might be underestimated due to the focus on formal medical treatises and institutions. Furthermore, it indicates that Ayurveda is a plural medical system in itself, playing a significant role in defining and treating illness in Sri Lanka."
Can the sugar-based sweeteners in traditional medicines have other benefits besides just sweetening?,"Traditional medicine systems around the globe, like Unani, Ayurveda and  traditional Chinese medicine, include a number of sugar-based formulations,  which contain a large amount of saccharide-containing sweetener, such as honey,  sucrose or jaggery. With pervasive lifestyle disorders throughout the world,  there have been discussions to consider alternative sweetening agents. Here,  from the perspective of Unani medicine, we discuss how the saccharide-based  sweeteners may be an essential component of these traditional preparations, like  electuaries, which may be deprived of their bioactivities without these  saccharides. With contemporary researches, it is known that apart from their own  therapeutic effects, saccharides also form deep eutectic solvents which help in  enhancing the bioactivity of other ingredients present in crude drugs. In  addition, they provide energy for fermentation which is essential for  biotransformation of compounds. Interestingly, the sugars also increase the  shelf-life of these compound drugs and act as natural preservatives. On the  basis of this review, we strongly believe that saccharide-based sweeteners are  an essential component of traditional medicines and not merely an excipient.","According to ""Why the ""sugars"" in traditional Unani formulations are a pivotal component: A viewpoint perspective"", the saccharide-based sweeteners found in traditional medicine systems like Unani and Ayurveda play crucial roles beyond just acting as sweeteners. They are not just excipients, but essential components that contribute to the bioactivity of the medicines. They form deep eutectic solvents that help enhance the bioactivity of other ingredients in the formulations. They provide energy for fermentation, which is necessary for the biotransformation of compounds, and they also serve as natural preservatives, increasing the shelf-life of these compound drugs."

What should I consider when using ayurvedic plants and Indian spices for health conditions?,"Traditional Indian medicine (ayurveda) is becoming increasingly popular, with  many chronic conditions responding to it well. Most patients begin to take  conventional medications as soon as their diagnoses are made, so ayurvedic  treatments are usually undergone alongside and/or after conventional medical  approaches. A detailed knowledge of the action of food, spices, and medicinal  plants is needed in order to understand their potential influence fully. While  societal use of ayurvedic plants and Indian spices is commonplace, without ill  effect, the use of more concentrated products made from single plants, often in  the form of teas or tablets, is of more concern. The mechanisms by which  polyherbal drugs and their extracts act differ in many respects from the actions  of single substances or synthetic drugs. Despite the fact that ayurvedic  medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their  method of administration, taking into account individuals' needs and their  specific disease conditions.","According to 'The Significance of Ayurvedic Medicinal Plants', Ayurvedic remedies often involve the use of food, spices, and medicinal plants. The effects of these treatments can vary widely depending on the specific method of administration and the individual needs and conditions of the patient.

How can Ayurveda and genomics help in personalized treatment for diseases?,"Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine documented and practised since  1500 B.C., follows a systems approach that has interesting parallels with  contemporary personalized genomic medicine approaches to the understanding and  management of health and disease. It is based on the trisutra, which are the  three aspects of causes, features and therapeutics that are interconnected  through a common organizing principle termed 'tridosha'. Tridosha comprise three  ascertainable physiological entities; vata (kinetic), pitta (metabolic) and  kapha (potential) that are pervasive across systems, work in conjunction with  each other, respond to the external environment and maintain homeostasis. Each  individual is born with a specific proportion of tridosha that are not only  genetically determined but also influenced by the environment during foetal  development. Jointly they determine a person's basic constitution, which is  termed their 'prakriti'. Development and progressi on of different diseases with  their subtypes are thought to depend on the origin and mechanism of perturbation  of the doshas, and the aim of therapeutic practice is to ensure that the doshas  retain their homeostatic state. Similarly, western systems biology epitomized by  translational P4 medicine envisages the integration of multiscalar genetic,  cellular, physiological and environmental networks to predict phenotypic  outcomes of perturbations. In this perspective article, we aim to outline the  shape of a unifying scaffold that may allow the two intellectual traditions to  enhance one another. Specifically, we illustrate how a unique integrative  'Ayurgenomics' approach can be used to integrate the trisutra concept of  Ayurveda with genomics. We observe biochemical and molecular correlates of  prakriti and show how these differ significantly in processes that are linked to  intermediate patho-phenotypes, known to take different course in diseases. We  also observe a significant enr ichment of the highly connected hub genes which  could explain differences in prakriti, focussing on EGLN1, a key oxygen sensor  that differs between prakriti types and is linked to high altitude adaptation.  Integrating our observation with the current literature, we demonstrate how  EGLN1 could qualify as a molecular equivalent of tridosha that can modulate  different phenotypic outcomes, where hypoxia is a cause or a consequence both  during health and diseased states. Our studies affirm that integration of the  trisutra framework through Ayurgenomics can guide the identification of  predisposed groups of individuals and enable discovery of actionable therapeutic  points in an individualized manner.","According to ""Genomic insights into ayurvedic and western approaches to personalized medicine"", Ayurveda is based on a systems approach that has parallels with contemporary personalized genomic medicine approaches.

Can nano-ayurvedic medicine be used as a potential natural treatment for cancer?,"Nano-ayurvedic medicine is an emerging field in which nanoparticles are  functionalized with active principles of potent ayurvedic herbs to enhance their  efficacy and target-specific delivery. Scientific advances in the past couple of  decades have revealed the molecular mechanisms behind the anticancer potential  of several ayurvedic herbs, attributed chiefly to their secondary metabolites  including polyphenols and other active substances. With the advancement of  nanotechnology, it has been established that size-, shape-, and  surface-chemistry-optimized nanoparticles can be utilized as synergizing  carriers for these phytochemicals. Nano-ayurvedic medicine utilizes herbs that  are commonly used in Ayurveda to functionalize different nanoparticles and  thereby enhance their potency and target specificity. Studies have shown that  the active phytochemicals of such herbs can be coated onto the nanoparticles of  different metals, such as gold, and that they work more efficiently than the  free herbal extract, for example, in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.

Can Ayurvedic therapy help with chronic urinary retention in elderly patients?,"INTRODUCTION: Neurogenic bladder is a common urological condition among elderly.  It results in incontinence or retention of the urine depending on the synergy of  bladder smooth muscles and urethral sphincter. There can also be a condition  where retention causes overflow incontinence. Retention of urine in this  condition is caused by relative lack of contractility of bladder smooth muscles  in response to the stretch reflex. As a result, there is no urge and therefore  the bladder remains over-distended causing retention of urine. Currently, there  are no absolute ways to deal with such a situation except that the patients are  advised for self-help techniques of regularly evacuating the bladder.  Pharmacotherapy for such condition is not promising. As the patients of  neurogenic bladder are often healthy otherwise (with manageable conditions such  as diabetes), a bladder dysfunction is considered as a disability that they do  not want to share. In this state, any approach that offers a regeneration of  bladder reflex and restoration of its functions is more than one can expect for. METHODS: An elderly male suffering with chronic urinary retention recommended  for indwelling catheterization after the failure of voiding trial following the  possible conventional pharmacotherapy was treated with Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS: There was a complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic  therapy. The changes were stable after 3-month follow-up of the patient. CONCLUSION: This case report presents the complete symptom reversal in a case of  chronic urine retention as an outcome of Ayurvedic therapy. Seeing the  importance of this clinical condition and unavailability of sufficient means in  conventional medicine, it requires a serious note and enquiry into its  applicability in similar cases.","According to 'Low-Pressure, Low-Flow Voiding Dysfunction in an Elderly Male Treated Through Ayurveda: A Case Report', an elderly male suffering from chronic urinary retention showed complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic therapy.

The Ayurvedic drug formulation is based on what is  known as ""Pancavidha Kasaaya"" concept. According to this concept there are five  basic forms of formulation known as 1-'Swarasa' the expressed juice, 2-'Kalka',  a fine paste obtained by grinding fresh or wet grinding dried plant material 3-  'Kwaatha', the decoction, 4- 'Sheeta' or 'Hima', the cold water infusion and 5-  'Faanta', the hot water infusion. Different aspects of their preparation and use  have been discussed. Further from the above basic forms, a number of other  formulations are derived; a brief description of each of them has been given  along with brief outlines of drug formulations meant for specific routes. The  third part of the review is devoted to discussion of influence of different  factors on the expression of pharmacological activity.","According to 'Bhaishajya Kalpanaa - the Ayurvedic pharmaceutics - an overview', Ayurvedic drug therapy is based on the concept of ""Pancavidha Kasaaya"".

What is the basic concept of Ayurvedic medicine and how can it contribute to maintaining health?,"In the prebiblical Ayurvedic origins, every creation inclusive of a human being  is a model of the universe. In this model, the basic matter and the dynamic  forces (Dosha) of the nature determine health and disease, and the medicinal  value of any substance (plant and mineral). The Ayurvedic practices (chiefly  that of diet, life style, and the Panchkarama) aim to maintain the Dosha  equilibrium. Despite a holistic approach aimed to cure disease, therapy is  customized to the individual's constitution (Prakruti). Numerous Ayurvedic  medicines (plant derived in particular) have been tested for their biological  (especially immunomodulation) and clinical potential using modern  ethnovalidation, and thereby setting an interface with modern medicine. To  understand Ayurvedic medicine, it would be necessary to first understand the  origin, basic concept and principles of Ayurveda.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine. Core concept, therapeutic principles, and current relevance', Ayurvedic remedies are primarily aimed at maintaining the balance of dynamic forces, known as Dosha, within the human body.

What are some traditional uses of the Aucklandia costus plant for treating health issues?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aucklandia costus Falc. a medicinal plant is  native to the Himalayan region and synonymous with Saussurea costus, Saussurea  lappa, and Aucklandia lappa. It has an ancient background of being used  ethnopharmacologically for various body ailments. According to Ayurveda, Unani,  Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Costus roots are recommended for  leukoderma, liver, kidney, blood disorders, Qi stagnation, and tridosha. Root  and powder are used orally with warm water to cure gastric problems, and the  paste is applied to the inflamed area to relieve pain. Root paste is applied on  the skin to cure boils, blisters, and leprosy. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present review is to establish a correlation  among the ethnopharmacological uses and scientific studies conducted on A.  costus with chemical constituents, safety & toxicity data including future  directions for its conservation with higher yield and effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted by studying books, research  papers, and literature in history, agroforestry, phytopharmacology of Himalayan  plants using international databases, publication, Red data book, and reports.  The search engines: Pubmed, Scopus, Wiley Inter-science, Indian Materia Medica,  Science Direct, and referred journals are referenced. RESULTS: The literature collected from databases, journals, websites, and books  mentioned the use of costus roots in local and traditional practices. CITES  included A. costus in a critically endangered category due to lack of cultural  practices and overexploitation from wild. A. costus roots are known since 13th  century for use in ancient Ayurvedic products but the scientific evaluation is  of future research interest. A correlation of traditional uses with scientific  studies has been explored to assess the effect of root powder, extract, oil and  isolated constituents: Costunolids, Saussureamine B and Dehydrocostus lactone  etc. in gastric ulceration and lesions; inhibition of antigen-induced  degranulation, mucin production, number of immune cells, eosinophils, and  expression and secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in asthma. The  inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators is also reported by Cynaropicrin,  Alantolactone, Caryophyllene, Costic acid. Also, the sesquiterpene lactones has  profound effect in inhibition of inflammatory stages and induced apoptotic  cascades in cancer. Very few data on the safety and toxicity of plant parts have  been noted which needs to be evaluated scientifically. CONCLUSION: A. costus have been noted to have remarkable effect for gastric,  hepatic, inflammatory, respiratory, cancer, skin problems but there were several  errors in selection of plant material, authentification, selection of dose,  assessment, selection of standard and control have been identified.

How does astrology influence the timing of taking medicines in Ayurveda for better health outcomes?,"Astrology is the art of predicting or determining the influence of the planets  and stars on human affairs. The origin of this word is from Greek word astron,  star + logos (discourse). Both Ayurveda and Astrology have established a way of  life in India since time immemorial. Highly advanced knowledge related to  Astrology on medicine is preserved in Indian Holy scriptures and transmitted  from generation to generation. Although both Astrology and medicine were  developed as a part of religion in ancient India, astrological principles  related to prevention, health care and relief from illness were applied as  rituals (religious ceremonies). An astrologer gives guidance for taking  medicines at suitable time for the best remedy of ailments. Even the medicinal  herbs were collected and used at appropriate times for their efficacy. Astrology  and Ayurveda are inseparable in human life. Role of the Astrology in healthy  life and pathogenesis of the disease is well known to Indians. When a physician  knows etiology of the disease, he attempts to treat the disease with specific  medication, diet and life style and also avoiding causative factors.

How can traditional South Asian healing practices be integrated into modern psychiatric treatment?,"Medical anthropologists have not paid enough attention to the variation at the  level of the individual practitioners of biomedicine, and anthropological  critiques of biomedical psychiatry as it is practiced in settings outside the  Global North have tended to depict psychiatrists in monolithic terms. In this  article, we attempt to demonstrate that, at least in the case of India, some  psychiatrists perceive limitations in the biomedical model and the cultural  assumptions behind biomedical practices and ideologies. This paper focuses on  three practitioners who supplement their own practices with local and  alternative healing modalities derived from South Asian psychologies,  philosophies, systems of medicine and religious and ritual practices. The  diverging psychiatric practices in this paper represent a rough continuum. They  range from a bold and confident psychiatrist who uses various techniques  including ritual healing to another who yearns to incorporate more Indian  philosophy and psychology in psychiatric practice and encourages students of  ayurvedic medicine to more fully embrace the science they are learning to a less  proactive psychiatrist who does not describe a desire to change his practice but  who is respectful and accepting of ayurvedic treatments that some patients also  undergo. Rather than simply applying a hegemonic biomedical psychiatry, these  psychiatrists offer the possibility of a more locally-attuned, context sensitive  psychiatric practice.","According to ""Curiosity and Creative Experimentation Among Psychiatrists in India"", some psychiatrists in India perceive limitations in the biomedical model and supplement their practices with remedies derived from South Asian psychologies, philosophies, systems of medicine and religious and ritual practices. These include the use of ritual healing and Ayurvedic treatments. Additionally, some of these practitioners also encourage students of ayurvedic medicine to embrace the science they are learning, indicating an integrated approach to mental health treatment that combines both traditional Ayurvedic and modern biomedical methods."
What are the benefits of using Ayurvedic pharmaceutical products over synthetic drugs?,"Pharmaceutical is one of the allied branches of science, which is closely  associated with Medical science. Today pharmaceutical chemistry and  pharmacognosy are playing important role in treatment for a disease and its  prevention. Herbal medicines are being used by about 80% of the world population  mostly in the developing countries in the primary health care. There has been an  upsurge in demand for the Phyto-pharmaceutical products of Ayurvĕda in western  nations, because of the fact that the synthetic drugs are considered to be  unsafe. Due to this many national and multinational pharmaceutical companies are  now concentrating on manufacturing of Ayurvĕdic Phyto-pharmaceutical products.  Ayurvĕda is the Indian traditional system of medicine, which also deals about  pharmaceutical science. The Ayurvĕdic knowledge of the pharmaceutical science is  scattered in Ayurvĕdic classical texts. Săranghadhara Samhita, which is written  by Săranghadhara, explain systematically about the information of the Ayurvĕdic  pharmaceutical science and also updated it. Industrialized manufacturing of  Ayurvĕdic dosage forms has brought in new challenges like deviation from basic  concepts of medicine preparation.

What can be done to ensure the quality and authenticity of Ayurvedic medicines given the current state of herbal drug supply?,"The present market for herbal drugs is estimated about ₹40 billion, which is  expected to increase by 16% in next 3-4 years. The current production of many  Ayurvedic herbs is less than their market demand, which incentivizes  adulteration in the Ayurvedic drug supply chain. The present work aims to  highlight the most used Ayurvedic plants that have been listed in the  International Union for Conservation of Nature's ""red list"" of endangered or  vulnerable plants. The future of Ayurvedic medicines from these listed plants is  uncertain, as the collection of herbs from their natural habitat is prohibited  and their cultivation does not meet market demands. Many of these plants, such  as Taxus baccata and T. wallichiana, are endangered and are only grown in their  natural habitats; their cultivation in other areas is impractical. This is the  present state, and will worsen as demand continues to grow, with increasing  populations and increasing adoption of this system of medicine. It is possible  that in coming years most of the Ayurvedic drugs will be adulterated, and will  cause only side effects rather than the therapeutic effects. The Ayurvedic  fundamentals are under-explored areas where the Ayurvedic practitioners and  research scientists can work together. The scientific work on the basic  principles will unravel many unknown or little-known facts of this ancient  science. Hence, the present review emphasizes the conservation of Ayurvedic  herbs, minimization of the use of medicinal plants and the promotion of the  research based on Ayurvedic fundamentals.","According to 'Status of Indian medicinal plants in the International Union for Conservation of 
Nature and the future of Ayurvedic drugs: Shouldn't think about Ayurvedic 
fundamentals?', the future of Ayurvedic medicines from plants listed as endangered or vulnerable, such as Taxus baccata and T. wallichiana, is uncertain due to restrictions on collection from their natural habitats and difficulties in cultivation to meet market demands. The paper suggests that the situation could lead to an increase in adulterated Ayurvedic drugs that could cause side effects rather than therapeutic effects.

What is the importance of maintaining personal integrity and compassion in Ayurvedic practice?,"Ayurveda, the indigenous medical system of India, has integrated the concept of  interconnectedness into its understanding of health and disease. It considers  the human body as an indivisible whole with a network of interrelated functions,  mind and consciousness, wherein a disturbance in one part will have  repercussions in other parts as well. The key to health is for these factors to  maintain stability since disease is seen as a perturbation in this network.  Ayurvedic treatment aims not only at removal of disease, but also at the  restoration of the equilibrium of bodily functions. The centuries-old science of  Ayurveda, apart from being a holistic form of medicine, also clearly defines the  student-teacher and doctor-patient relationship. It sets high ethical standards  of professional and personal integrity for the doctor, teacher and student. In  addition to being technically skilled and well-read in the science,  practitioners of Ayurveda must be compassionate and empathetic. Students of  Ayurveda are taught the importance of compassionate caring for patients and  maintaining personal integrity.","According to 'Healthcare the Ayurvedic way', the key Ayurvedic remedy is to not only focus on the removal of disease but also on the restoration of the equilibrium of bodily functions. This holistic form of medicine views the human body as an interconnected network of functions, mind, and consciousness. Any disturbance in one part of this network impacts others, so the maintenance of stability across all these factors is vital for health. Furthermore, Ayurveda places significant emphasis on the role of the practitioner, who should be technically skilled, well-read in the science, and importantly, compassionate and empathetic."
What lifestyle changes does Ayurveda suggest for managing epilepsy?,"This article discusses etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, and treatment of  epilepsy, as described in Charaka Samhitā (translation: Charaka's Compendium)  and Sushruta Samhitā, the two core texts of Ayurveda, an ancient system of  medicine. Ayurveda emphasized amnesia and loss of consciousness as core features  of epileptic seizures (Sanskrit: apasmar; translation: apa negation, smaran  memory) and recognized that seizures occur due to a disturbance in brain  function or flow of ""humors"" to the brain. Semiology of various seizure types  was well described. Epilepsy was attributed to both internal and multiple  exogenous factors. Treatment of epilepsy with formulations of naturally  occurring substances, their compounding and use, is described in remarkable  detail. Lifestyle modifications to protect people with epilepsy are also  documented. Cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy were recognized. Although none  of the Ayurveda formulations have any empirical evidence supporting their safety  or efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy, studies are needed to generate  relevant evidence, to recognize their hazards, and to integrate traditional and  complementary systems of medicine with modern health care in an informed and  safe manner.","According to 'Ancient Indian concepts about phenomenology, biology, and therapeutics of epilepsy', Ayurveda describes the treatment of epilepsy with formulations of naturally occurring substances, detailing their compounding and use. It also recommends lifestyle modifications to protect people with epilepsy. However, the safety and efficacy of these Ayurvedic formulations for epilepsy treatment have not yet been empirically confirmed through studies."
How can Ayurvedic medicine be utilized to improve iron and iodine deficiency in women in Bangladesh?,"Bangladesh is now facing the public health problems of deficiency of iron and  iodine, especially for women. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of  Bangladesh has implemented strong countermeasures to enhance the health  condition of the nation. On the other hand, based on the concept of the  Declaration of Alma-Ata, complementary and alternative medicine should be used  more vigorously to enhance public health in the world. The usage of  complementary and alternative medicine such as ayurvedic medicine (AM) should be  increased in Bangladesh. Therefore we conducted the study on perceptions of AM  by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh in order to promote and enhance the effective  usage of AM, including herbal medicines as medical resources, from December 2010  to January 2011. This study showed younger citizens (61.1%) did not get more  benefit from AM than elder citizens (48.0%). On the other hand, younger citizens  (76.8%) did not get more harm from AM than elder citizens (70.1%). We think that  in terms of effectiveness of AM, the younger generation in Dhaka seems to be  more skeptical to AM than the elder generation in Dhaka, even though the younger  generation are more satisfied with AM than the elder generation. With viewpoint  of enhancement of usage of AM in Dhaka, we think that scientifically sound  information on AM should be collected rigorously and brought to the citizens  vigorously to remove the skeptical feeling of AM from younger citizen in Dhaka.  In terms of the effective utilization of limited medical resources, AM should be  used appropriately in Bangladesh, Asia and the world.","According to ""Perceptions of Ayurvedic medicine by citizens in Dhaka, Bangladesh"", the usage of complementary and alternative medicine such as Ayurvedic Medicine (AM), including herbal medicines, should be increased in Bangladesh to enhance public health. However, the study found that younger citizens in Dhaka seem to be more skeptical about the effectiveness of AM, even though they're more satisfied with it than the elder generation. The paper suggests that scientifically sound information on AM should be rigorously collected and shared with citizens to alleviate skepticism, especially among younger people. This would encourage the appropriate use of AM as an effective medical resource."
Can Ayurvedic medicine help in managing diabetes?,"Diabetes mellitus, known as diabetes, is a challenging issue, and to control  diabetes, a large population is lining toward ayurvedic medicine. In the present  study, four brands of anti-diabetic ayurvedic medicines, along with a home  remedy, are analyzed using the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopic (LIBS)  technique. The study is carried out to know the elements responsible for  glycemic potential. The laser-induced breakdown (LIB) spectra elucidate the  presence of organic and inorganic elements like Al, Ba, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, H, K, Mg,  N, Na, O, Si, Sr, Zn, and the molecular band of CN molecule in medicines. LIBS  result also reveals Na and K's distinct concentration, which plays a vital role  in diabetes management. The presence of the CN band and organic elements  indicate the presence of organic molecular compositions in medicines. For  confirmation of organic composition in the drugs, Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy (FT-IR) has been performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on  the LIBS data of the medicines has been used for instant discrimination based on  their elemental/molecular compositions.","According to ""Evaluation of Na and K in anti-diabetic ayurvedic medicine using LIBS"", four different brands of anti-diabetic Ayurvedic medicines and a home remedy were analyzed. The study revealed the presence of elements such as Al, Ba, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, H, K, Mg, N, Na, O, Si, Sr, Zn, and CN molecule in these medicines. Particularly, the concentrations of Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) were found to play a vital role in diabetes management. Organic molecular compositions were also found in these medicines, confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)."
Can Ayurvedic medicine be used to boost the immune system?,"Ethnopharmacology and natural product drug discovery remains a significant hope  in the current target-rich, lead-poor scenario. Many modern drugs have origin in  traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology. Traditional Indian Medicine -  Ayurveda has a long history and is one of the great living traditions.  Considerable research on pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology and clinical  therapeutics has been carried out on Ayurvedic medicinal plants. Several  preclinical and clinical studies have examined cytoprotective, immunomodulatory  and immunoadjuvant potential of Ayurvedic medicines. The ethnopharmacology  knowledge, its holistic and systems approach supported by experiential base can  serve as an innovative and powerful discovery engine for newer, safer and  affordable medicines.","According to ""Ethnopharmacology and drug discovery"", Ayurvedic medicines have been found to have cytoprotective, immunomodulatory and immunoadjuvant benefits.

What does the tridosha theory in Ayurveda suggest about managing health conditions related to blood imbalance?,"It has been said that the tridosha theory in Ayurveda originated from the theory  of the three elements of the universe. The names of these three doshas, which  are roughly equivalent to humour, are vata (wind), pitta (bile), and Kapha  (phlegm), corresponding to the three elements of the universe: air, fire, and  water. On the other hand, Buddhist medicine which has a close relation to  Ayurveda is based on the theory of the four elements of the universe which  includes the earth as well as the three elements mentioned above. Greek medicine  on the other hand, is founded on the theory of the four humours, i.e. blood,  yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Furthermore, even in Ayurveda, like in  ""Sushruta Samhita"", the theory of the four humours can be found: this includes  the above-mentioned tridosha plus blood as the fourth humour. ""Timaios"" by Plato  also mentions this. We compared these various theories and pointed out that the  tridosha theory had its origin in the theory of the four elements of the  universe. The process of the formation of the tridosha theory is considered as  follows: (1) ""Earth"" was segregated from the four elements of the universe owing  to its solid properties, and was rearranged into the seven elements of the body  called ""dhatu""; and the other three elements. ""water"", ""fire"", and ""air"", were  integrated as the tridosha theory, namely, the theory of the three humours,  owing to their properties of fluid; (2) ""Blood"", assigned to the element of  ""earth"", was segregated from the tridosha because ""blood"" was considered to be  comprised of the properties of every humour without having its own peculiar  properties. Therefore, the diseases caused by deranged ""blood"" were regarded as  an aggregate disease caused by the other three deranged humours. Then the  category of the disease, caused by deranged ""earth"", did not appear.","According to [Comparative studies of the tridosha theory in Ayurveda and the theory of the four deranged elements in Buddhist medicine], the three doshas in Ayurveda, vata (wind), pitta (bile), and Kapha (phlegm), correspond to the three elements of the universe: air, fire, and water. The formation of the tridosha theory is believed to have occurred by segregating ""Earth"" from the four elements due to its solid properties. It was then rearranged into the seven elements of the body called ""dhatu"" while the other three elements, ""water"", ""fire"", and ""air"", were integrated as the tridosha theory due to their fluid properties"
What initiatives are in place to support the use of AYUSH in managing diseases in India?,"The double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases is a major threat  to the Indian public health system. AYUSH, an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and  Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy, represents the Indian  system of medicine recognized by the Government of India. Mainstreaming of AYUSH  is one of the key strategies of the Indian government for tackling increasing  disease burden through initiatives such as AYUSH wellness centers, telemedicine,  and quality control measures for medications in the AYUSH system of medicine.  Such investment of resources in health systems may require economic evaluations.  However, such evaluations are lacking in the AYUSH system, except for a few in  homeopathy and yoga. In the absence of evidence from economic evaluations,  researchers and decision makers are guided mostly by clinical efficacy while  formulating healthcare strategies. In view of the increasing use of AYUSH across  the country, economic evaluations of the AYUSH system are the need of the hour  to aid healthcare decision making.","According to ""Promoting health economic evaluation studies in the AYUSH system of medicine: the need of the hour"", the Indian government is promoting the use of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy (collectively known as AYUSH) to tackle the increasing disease burden in the country. This is being implemented through initiatives such as AYUSH wellness centers, telemedicine, and quality control measures for medications in the AYUSH system of medicine. However, the paper also highlights the need for economic evaluations of the AYUSH system to support healthcare decision making."
What are some Ayurvedic treatments for managing fever and cough symptoms?,"Hot (Ushna) and cold (sheet) are two fundamental precepts of Ayurvedic medicine  reflected variously within the context of health and disease. These are  fundamental for being essential attributes of three doshas, namely, Vata, Pitta,  and Kapha, forming the very basis of Ayurvedic constructs of health and disease.  Ushna is the inherent property of Pitta, symbolizing fire both inside and  outside the body. There are pathologies of Pitta where this Ushna property  participates in pathogenesis to present the features like burning, sour  eructation, and fever. In such cases, the course of treatment eventually focuses  on reducing Pitta or reducing the Ushna property of Pitta, in particular. A  similar cold association is found with Vata and Kapha, where the pathogenesis is  reflected as heaviness, cold and cough, and edema. The treatment of Vata and  Kapha diseases eventually focuses upon their reduction or reducing cold-related  pathogenesis, in particular. This is evident that these two form an essential  and integral component of Ayurvedic understanding of health and disease and are  practically applied to make a diagnosis and define the treatment. In this  chapter, we are expanding the details of Ushna and Sheeta constructs of  Ayurvedic medicine and elaborating on their health and disease application.","According to ""Principle of Hot (Ushna) and Cold (Sheeta) and Its Clinical Application in Ayurvedic Medicine"", Ushna is the inherent property of Pitta, symbolizing fire both inside and outside the body.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments or precautions for epilepsy?,"The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, meaning science of life, is the  oldest system of medicine in the world. Epilepsy is defined as Apasmara: apa,  meaning negation or loss of; smara, meaning recollection or consciousness. Aura  was recognized and was called Apasmara Poorva Roopa. A large number of symptoms  indicative of aura were listed. Worthy of mention are subjective sensation of  sounds, sensation of darkness, feeling of delusion, and dream-like state. An  actual attack of Apasmara includes falling down; shaking of the hands, legs, and  body; rolling up of the eyes; grinding of the teeth; and foaming at the mouth.  Four major types of epilepsy based on the disturbance of doshas (humors) that  govern the physiological and physiochemical activities of the body are  mentioned. Apasmara is considered a dangerous disease that is chronic and  difficult to treat. Several causes are mentioned. Treatment included correcting  the etiological factors and dietary regimen and avoiding dangerous places that  may result in injuries.","According to 'Epilepsy in ancient India', Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical system, defines epilepsy as Apasmara. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as falling down, shaking of the hands, legs, and body, rolling up of the eyes, grinding of the teeth, and foaming at the mouth. The Ayurvedic treatment for Apasmara includes correcting the etiological factors, following a specific dietary regimen, and avoiding dangerous places that may result in injuries."
How can Ayurveda's approach to chronic pain management be integrated into my daily lifestyle?,"Background: Ayurveda's preventive focus complements its strength with the  interventionist approach of the biomedical in chronic pain self-management.  Patient-centered care (PCC) using ethnomedicine promises greater patient  self-management; however, few studies have examined environmental relationships  and PCC in self-management of chronic pain through Ayurveda. Objective: To  examine how Ayurveda's philosophical focus on whole system frameworks describes  the integration of the individual and the ecological in tailoring an integrative  patient-centered diagnostic and prognostic approach to chronic pain management.  Methods: This qualitative case study conducted in-depth semi-structured  interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India (N = 10) and a qualitative  inductive content analytic approach. Findings: The diagnostic and  interpretational framework of the doshas supports the integration of the  individual and the ecological through (a) the circadian and seasonal cycles  relating mind-body awareness with diet, lifestyle (e.g., yoga), and breath  (e.g., pranayama), and (b) biogeographical and ecosystemic regions relating the  biogeographical and the ecological (e.g., desh) with the regulatory principle of  pain and its physiological and anatomical perception (vata) in an approach that  goes beyond treating pain etiology to a whole person PCC approach. Conclusions:  The study highlights how circadian and seasonal cycles and evolutionary  spatial-temporal factors of biogeographical and ecological regions are employed  in patient assessment and self-management to support patient involvement.  Recommendations for PCC in integrative chronic pain management include  supporting patient ownership of their care through the dosha framework that  relates the individual and the ecological in the patient's own life-context and  supports co-creation of a collaborative plan of care using an ethnomedical  framework.","According to 'Patient Assessment and Chronic Pain Self-Management in Ethnomedicine: Seasonal and Ecosystemic Embodiment in Ayurvedic Patient-Centered Care', Ayurveda's approach to managing chronic pain involves the integration of the individual and the ecological, using the dosha framework. This approach takes into account circadian and seasonal cycles, diet, lifestyle factors such as yoga, and breath practices like pranayama. It also considers biogeographical and ecological regions in relation to the regulatory principle of pain. This whole-person, patient-centered care approach encourages patients to take ownership of their care and supports the co-creation of a collaborative care plan using an ethnomedical framework."
What are some traditional Indian medicinal plants that could potentially help in managing COVID-19 symptoms?,"Traditional Indian medical practices (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy)  are a vast reservoir of knowledge about medicinal plants.

Is Ephedra juice safe to consume and what are its potential health benefits?,"Ephedra juice is used as the drink of longevity given even to the new born. This  is an Aryan custom mentioned in Rigveda and followed even by the Romans. To  trace the history of this custom would lead to identifying Soma = Ephedra. The  original species of Ephedra or Soma proper would be Ephedra sinica, the Chinese  plant. It is the one species with yellow stalks. This has been illustrated so  that it confirms Rigveda speaking of Soma as ""golden yellow."" The name Soma is  also a loan word from Chinese meaning ""fire-yellow fibers of hemp."" The plant  Soma is described as ""thousand boughs"" and photographic evidence has been  offered in support. Each stalk is rod-like resembling an arrow as Rigveda speaks  of it.

What are some benefits of incorporating Yoga into my daily routine?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Indian medicine is one of the oldest  medical systems and remains popular worldwide. Traditional medicine systems in  China and India have historical origins pertaining to mutual learning,  reference, and development from medical theory to the drugs used. The exchange  of traditional medicine between China and India began in the Qin and Han  Dynasties (221 BC-220 AD), prospered in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and  declined after the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). It was also directly related to  the rise and fall of Buddhism. The traditional medicines of the two countries  are highly complementary because of differences in geographical climate and the  modernisation process of traditional medicine. AIM: This review aimed to understand the spread and development of traditional  Indian medicine in China to further promote exchange and cooperation between  China and India in the field of traditional medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE via PubMed,  CNKI, Science Direct, Sci-Hub, and other databases using the terms 'traditional  Indian medicine' or 'Indian medicine' or 'Ayurveda' or 'Yoga' or 'Unani', and  limiting the search to articles published between 1958 and 2019. We analysed the  sources, publication date, type, and topic of the retrieved articles/studies. RESULTS: Based on the results of research on traditional Indian medicine carried  out by Chinese scholars, 518 academic papers and 60 classic works published in  China and abroad were collected. The results showed the following. First,  Chinese scholars have systematically investigated traditional Indian medicine  including its composition, management, and education; the scale of medicinal and  pharmaceutical plants; protective measures of intellectual property rights of  traditional medicine; and international promotion of Yoga. Second, studies have  examined the development status of traditional Indian medicine in China  including the spread of Yoga in the country and the industrial scale of,  education in, existing problems in, and clinical research on Yoga. In addition,  Chinese scholars conducted research on and the translation of classic works and  terms of Ayurveda, and studied the theory, treatment, and medicine thereof.  Third, the historical exchange and trading status of traditional medicine  between India and China have been discussed, including the exchange of  traditional medicine between the two countries, effect of traditional Indian  medicine on Chinese Buddhism, and minority medicine and trade in medicinal  materials between the two countries. CONCLUSION: India attaches great importance to the management of, education in,  and industry of traditional medicine, and has made various efforts to protect  intellectual property rights. Indian Yoga is very popular in China, and Chinese  scholars have conducted some clinical research thereon. However, regulatory  systems and legislation for Yoga are lacking in China. At present, traditional  Chinese medicine scholars have an enhanced understanding of the term Yoga and  less knowledge of the terms Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and similar concepts. We  suggest that Chinese scholars further study the classic works, basic theories,  treatment of clinical diseases, medicinal materials, and prescriptions  compounding traditional Indian medicine. The results of this study highlight  directions for Chinese scholars to pursue in further studying traditional Indian  medicine comprehensively, and will help promote exchange and cooperation between  China and India in the field of traditional medicine.","According to ""Traditional Indian medicine in China: The status quo of recognition, development and research"", traditional Indian medicine, including Ayurveda, Yoga, and Unani, has gained recognition in China.

What are some Ayurvedic plants that can help in managing high cholesterol levels?,"Ayurveda is the ancient (before 2500 b.c.) Indian system of health care and  longevity. It involves a holistic view of man, his health, and illness.  Ayurvedic treatment of a disease consists of salubrious use of drugs, diets, and  certain practices. Medicinal preparations are invariably complex mixtures, based  mostly on plant products. Around 1,250 plants are currently used in various  Ayurvedic preparations. Many Indian medicinal plants have come under scientific  scrutiny since the middle of the nineteenth century, although in a sporadic  fashion. The first significant contribution from Ayurvedic materia medica came  with the isolation of the hypertensive alkaloid from the sarpagandha plant  (Rouwolfia serpentina), valued in Ayurveda for the treatment of hypertension,  insomnia, and insanity. This was the first important ancient-modern concordance  in Ayurvedic plants. With the gradual coming of age of chemistry and biology,  disciplines central to the study of biologic activities of natural products,  many Ayurvedic plants have been reinvestigated.

Is processed aconite safe to use in Ayurvedic treatments?,"Crude aconite is an extremely lethal substance. However, the science of Ayurveda  looks upon aconite as a therapeutic entity. Crude aconite is always processed  i.e. it undergoes 'samskaras' before being utilised in the Ayurvedic  formulations. This study was undertaken in mice, to ascertain whether  'processed' aconite is less toxic as compared to the crude or unprocessed one.  It was seen that crude aconite was significantly toxic to mice (100% mortality  at a dose of 2.6 mg/mouse) whereas the fully processed aconite was absolutely  non-toxic (no mortality at a dose even 8 times as high as that of crude  aconite). Further, all the steps in the processing were essential for complete  detoxification.","According to ""Can we dispense with Ayurvedic samskaras?"", crude aconite, while extremely lethal, is considered a therapeutic entity in Ayurveda but only after it undergoes various 'samskaras' or processing steps. These steps are vital to detoxify the aconite, making it safe for use in Ayurvedic formulations. The study found that while crude aconite was significantly toxic to mice, resulting in 100% mortality at a dose of 2.6 mg/mouse, fully processed aconite was completely non-toxic, even at doses eight times higher. This indicates the importance of the processing steps in Ayurvedic remedies."

What are some common reasons people seek Ayurvedic treatments in Sweden?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda has its historical roots in India, but has also been  internationalised, partly via migration and partly through an increased interest  in alternative medicine in the West, where studies point toward increased use.  However, there is to date scarce knowledge about the use and experiences of  ayurveda in Sweden. METHODS: We have conducted a case study of a center for ayurvedic healthcare in  Sweden. We have collected information on client background data from the  center's documentation, and compiled data from all clients who visited the  centre for ayurvedic consultation during spring 2014. In total, 55 individuals  were included in the study, and 18 of them were chosen for individual  semi-structured interviews, to gain a deeper understanding of their motives for  seeking, and experiences of ayurvedic health care. The material was analysed and  compiled through a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Among the 55 clients, 91% were female the mean age was 47 years, and  64% gave a specific illness as a reason for seeking ayurveda. The most common  illnesses were respiratory, musculoskeletal, circulatory, tumor, and cutaneous  illnesses. The qualitative results showed that ayurveda was being used in  combination with other methods, including various diets, other alternative  medicine methods and conventional medicine. Some participants recounted having  sought ayurveda as a complement to conventional medicine, or in cases when  conventional medicine had been experienced as insufficient in terms of diagnosis  or treatment. However, some participants experienced it as difficult to follow  the ayurvedic life-style advice in the midst of their everyday life. Many  participants reported positive experiences of pulse diagnostics, which was the  main diagnostic method used in ayurvedic consultation. Some reported concrete,  physical improvement of their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study points towards important aspects of participant  experience of ayurveda, that may be subject to further research. The positive  effects experienced by some clients should be studied more systematically in  order to discern whether they are specific or non-specific. In addition,  interesting knowledge may be gained through further study of the reported  positive experiences of pulse diagnosis.","According to 'The use of ayurvedic medicine in the context of health promotion--a mixed methods case study of an ayurvedic centre in Sweden', Ayurvedic healthcare is often sought for specific illnesses, including respiratory, musculoskeletal, circulatory, tumor, and cutaneous diseases. It is commonly used in conjunction with other treatments, such as different diets, other alternative medical methods, and conventional medicine. Some individuals turn to Ayurveda when conventional medicine has not provided satisfactory diagnosis or treatment. However, the Ayurvedic lifestyle can be challenging to follow in everyday life. Many clients reported positive experiences with pulse diagnostics, the main diagnostic method used in Ayurvedic consultations, with some noting physical improvement in their symptoms."
Is it safe to take Ayurvedic medicines regularly in terms of radiation exposure?,"Purpose: Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicines in the world being  practiced widely in the Indian subcontinent for more than 3000 years, and still  remains as one of the important traditional health care systems. The Ayurvedic  drugs are derived primarily from various parts of the plants, like root, leaf,  flower, fruit or plant as a whole. Plants uptake minerals and other nutrients  from the soil through their root system. Along with other minerals radionuclides  present in the growing media also reach to the plant parts following the same  pathway. Realizing the probable health hazards via the intake of Ayurvedic  drugs, it is important to assess the concentration of natural radionuclides in  commonly used medicinal plants.Materials and methods: NaI(Tl) scintillator-based  gamma-ray spectrometry has been used to determine the activity concentrations of  primordial radionuclides (226Ra, 232Th and 40K) in the most commonly used  medicinal plant parts as ingredients of Ayurvedic medicines in India.Results and  discussion: The average specific activity (Bqkg-1) of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K was  found to be 43 ± 18, 36 ± 15[Formula: see text] and 230 ± 46, respectively. The  estimated annual committed effective doses due to the intake of common Ayurvedic  medicines at prescribed dosage was found to be 39 ± 16 µSv y-1,[Formula: see  text] which is quite low as compared with the radiation dose limit of 1 mSvy-1  from all natural sources, reported by the International Commission on  Radiological Protection (ICRP-60).Conclusions: It is found categorically that  intake of Ayurvedic medicines at normal dosage poses no radiological hazard to  the individual. Present results are significant in the wake of myths that many  hazardous materials including radioisotopes are present at higher levels.  Obtained results also serve as a reference information for the distribution of  radionuclides in medicinal plant species.","According to ""Radionuclide concentrations in medicinal florae and committed effective dose through Ayurvedic medicines"", Ayurvedic medicines are primarily derived from various parts of plants like the root, leaf, flower, fruit or the whole plant. These plants, while absorbing minerals and nutrients from the soil, can also uptake radionuclides. However, the research found that the annual committed effective doses from the intake of common Ayurvedic medicines are quite low compared to the radiation dose limit from all natural sources reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Therefore, the intake of Ayurvedic medicines at normal dosage poses no radiological hazard to the individual."
"What are some traditional Indian treatments for low back and neck pain, and are there any known side effects?","INTRODUCTION: Low back and neck pain are common musculoskeletal disorders with  multiple treatment options. India's traditional medical systems, known as Ayush  (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy)  offer range of interventions and are widely used. In view of limited  documentation of adverse events following Ayush interventions for lumbar and  cervical spondylosis, we synthesized evidence and estimated proportion of  studies reporting adverse events. METHODS: We systematically searched all published documents from biomedical and  multidisciplinary abstract and citation databases and Ayush-specific  repositories from their inception to April 2021. We selected studies as per  inclusion criteria and extracted information, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We  systematically reviewed the qualitative evidence form the selected studies. RESULTS: Majority (94%) of the selected 113 studies were interventional studies  and included 77 (68.1%) journal articles and 35 (31%) academic dissertations.  Among the Ayush systems, considerable proportion was from Ayurveda (32.7%),  followed by Siddha (24.8%), Yoga (22.1%), Unani (15.9%) and Homoeopathy (4.4%).  Almost three-fourths of the studies were on lumbar spondylosis (65%; n = 74),  followed by cervical spondylosis (31%; n = 35), and the remaining four included  both. Thirteen percent of the 113 studies described adverse events [Yoga = 9.7%;  Unani = 1.8% and Homoeopathy = 1.8%]. More adverse events were reported among  the studies on lumbar (9.7%) than cervical spondylosis (2.7%). The nature of  interventions were non-pharmacological (10.6%; n = 12), pharmacological (n = 2;  1.8%) or combined (n = 1; 0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Only one in eight studies reported any adverse event following  Ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis. There could be certain  degree of underreporting of adverse events and requires further exploration.  PROSPERO Registration ID CRD42020167433.","According to ""Adverse events in India's Ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis: a systematic review"", Ayurveda, Siddha, Yoga, Unani, and Homoeopathy (collectively known as Ayush) are commonly used traditional medical systems in India for treating musculoskeletal disorders like low back and neck pain. Among the Ayush systems, Ayurveda (32.7%), Siddha (24.8%), and Yoga (22.1%) were the most frequently used for lumbar and cervical spondylosis treatments. Adverse events were reported in only 13% of the studies, with more adverse events from treatments for lumbar spondylosis (9.7%)"
What are some traditional herbal remedies used in far-west Nepal for common ailments?,"BACKGROUND: Plant species have long been used as principal ingredients of  traditional medicine in far-west Nepal. The medicinal plants with ethnomedicinal  values are currently being screened for their therapeutic potential but their  data and information are inadequately compared and analyzed with the Ayurveda  and the phytochemical findings. METHODS: The present study evaluated ethnomedicinal plants and their uses  following literature review, comparison, field observations, and analysis.  Comparison was made against earlier standard literature of medicinal plants and  ethnomedicine of the same area, the common uses of the Ayurveda and the latest  common phytochemical findings. The field study for primary data collection was  carried out from 2006-2008. RESULTS: The herbal medicine in far-west Nepal is the basis of treatment of most  illness through traditional knowledge. The medicine is made available via  ancient, natural health care practices such as tribal lore, home herbal remedy,  and the Baidhya, Ayurveda and Amchi systems. The traditional herbal medicine has  not only survived but also thrived in the trans-cultural environment with its  intermixture of ethnic traditions and beliefs. The present assessment showed  that traditional herbal medicine has flourished in rural areas where modern  medicine is parsimoniously accessed because of the high cost and long travel  time to health center. Of the 48 Nepalese medicinal plants assessed in the  present communication, about half of the species showed affinity with the common  uses of the Ayurveda, earlier studies and the latest phytochemical findings. The  folk uses of Acacia catechu for cold and cough, Aconitum spicatum as an  analgesic, Aesculus indica for joint pain, Andrographis paniculata for fever,  Anisomeles indica for urinary affections, Azadirachta indica for fever,  Euphorbia hirta for asthma, Taxus wallichiana for tumor control, and Tinospora  sinensis for diabetes are consistent with the latest pharmacological findings,  common Ayurvedic and earlier uses. CONCLUSIONS: Although traditional herbal medicine is only a primary means of  health care in far-west Nepal, the medicine has been pursued indigenously with  complementing pharmacology and the Ayurveda. Therefore, further pharmacological  evaluation of traditional herbal medicine deserves more attention.","According to ""Traditional herbal medicine in far-west Nepal: a pharmacological appraisal"", herbal medicine is a principal form of treatment in far-west Nepal. Around half of the 48 Nepalese medicinal plants assessed in the study showed similarity with common Ayurvedic uses and recent phytochemical findings.

What are some traditional treatments for skin diseases like Vitiligo in Ayurveda?,The earliest known reference to Kilăsa was in 2200 B.C. in the period of  Aushooryan. In 1550 B.C. information regarding Vitiligo was noted in the Ebers  Papyrus. Atharvavĕda also carries the description of the disease Kilăsa along  with several herbal prescriptions. Buddhist literature (Pĭtikăs) especially  Vinaya Pĭtika carries the description of Kilăsa. Old Testament also carries the  description of white spots i.e. in the Leviticus chapter 13. In ayurvĕda the  word Kuşţa was used for all types of skin diseases. Both Kilăsa and Switra are  mentioned together in ayurvĕda because of similarity in their aetiology. Kilăsa  is also called as Băhya (external) Kuşţa. It is classified into three types  based on three Dŏşăs. Prognosis of the disease was also described in ayurvĕda.  This disease can be compared with Vitiligo/leucoderma in modern medicine. The  Roman Physician Celsus first coined the term Vitiligo in the 2nd Century A.D.

What are some marine by-products used in Ayurvedic medicines?,"Natural resources such as plants, animals and minerals have always been used by  mankind to develop drugs and marine world is no exception. Marine by-products  like conches, pearls, mother of pearl shells, corals and so forth have been used  by traditional Ayurvedic practitioners for centuries. The unique methods of  these preparations are scientifically designed to eliminate unwanted impurities  and convert them into bioavailable form. In this study, Conch (Xanchus pyrum)  was used as a marine resource of calcium carbonate and was converted  pharmaceutically from its aragonite form to calcite. All the steps of  preparations and changes in the properties therein were documented and  validated. Further, traditional as well as modern analytical tools were used to  study its physical and chemical characters to develop a monograph. The physical  characterization included particle size, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning  Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Fourier  Transform Infra-red (FTIR). Metal composition and heavy metal limits were  determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry  (ICPOES). This study revealed the rearrangement of aragonite crystals into  calcite form by grinding, trituration with aloe vera juice and incineration  under controlled conditions.

Are there any health risks associated with the preservatives used in Ayurvedic supplements?,"OBJECTIVES: Ayurvedic formulations are becoming the prior choice of people as  health care supplements. The increasing demand for these formulations has led to  extensive development of Ayurvedic pharmaceutical industries worldwide. The  reaction between the preservatives (sodium benzoates and ascorbic acid) used in  these formulations could generate benzene. Benzene is classified as class-1  human carcinogen and responsible for various short and long term health effects. METHODS: In this study, 25 formulations (containing ascorbic acid and sodium  benzoate) of various manufacturers available as over the counter products were  obtained and their benzene content were determined using gas chromatograph with  flame ionization detector. RESULTS: The result showed that 64% of the formulations were free from benzene  contamination whereas 36% of formulations were found to be contaminated with  benzene. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and validated gas  chromatographic method for estimation of benzene in Ayurvedic formulations was  also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that the level of benzene was within permissible  limits, yet the presence of a carcinogen in the marketed formulations intended  for internal use is an alarming situation.","According to ""Ayurvedic formulations containing benzoic and ascorbic acids as additives: benzene formation during storage and impact of additives on quality parameters"", Ayurvedic formulations may contain benzene, a class-1 human carcinogen, due to a reaction between preservatives used in these formulations, namely sodium benzoates and ascorbic acid.

Can the taste of a medicinal plant predict its health benefits according to Ayurveda?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the patterns that shape  traditional medical knowledge is essential for accelerating ethnopharmacological  progress. According to Ayurveda, medicinal plants that belong to different taxa,  but which have similar taste, may display similar (ethno)pharmacological  activities (EPAs) (Bhishagratna, 1998; Sharma and Dash, 2006). AIM OF THE STUDY: To understand the patterns that govern the distribution of  herbal EPAs in Ayurveda and to evaluate the potential concordance between  chemical class or taste of the constituent phytocompounds and EPAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mixed database (PhytoMolecularTasteDB) was constructed  for Ayurvedic medicinal plants by integrating modern data (medicinal plant  composition, phytochemical taste) with traditional data (ethnopharmacological  activities of plant). PhytoMolecularTasteDB contains 431 Ayurvedic medicinal  plants, 94 EPAs, 223 chemical classes of phytocompounds and 438 herbal tastants.  Potential global or individual associations between chemical classes/taste of  the phytoconstituents and EPAs were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: There was no global statistical correlation between the various  chemical classes of phytocompounds and EPAs, although there were several  individual correlations. The results suggest the existence of a global  statistical correlation (besides several individual correlations) between the  plant ""molecular taste"" (various taste-based classes of phytocompounds) and  EPAs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that phytochemical taste may be more relevant  than chemical class for EPAs prediction.","According to ""Taste of phytocompounds: A better predictor for ethnopharmacological activities of medicinal plants than the phytochemical class?"", Ayurvedic medicinal plants with similar tastes may display similar ethnopharmacological activities (EPAs). The study analyzed a database of 431 Ayurvedic medicinal plants, 94 EPAs, 223 chemical classes of phytocompounds and 438 herbal tastants. The results suggest there is a global statistical correlation between the taste of the phytocompounds and EPAs, implying that the taste of phytochemicals might be more relevant for predicting the medicinal effects of the plants than their chemical class."
What can tribal medicine practices in Meghalaya offer for common health issues?,"BACKGROUND: National policy on medical pluralism in India encourages the  mainstreaming of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) systems  and the revitalization of local health traditions (LHT). In Meghalaya state in  the northeast, the main LHT is its indigenous tribal traditional medicine. This  paper presents the perceptions of tribal medicine and of AYUSH systems among  various policy actors and locates the tribal medicine of Meghalaya within the  policy on medical pluralism currently being implemented in the state, a region  that is ethnically and culturally different and predominantly inhabited by  indigenous peoples. METHODS: A stakeholder mapping exercise identified appropriate policy actors and  46 in-depth interviews were conducted with policy makers, doctors, academics,  members of healer associations and elders of the community. A further 44  interviews were conducted with 24 Khasi and 20 Garo traditional healers.  Interview data were supplemented with document analysis and observations.  Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis that incorporated  elements of grounded theory. RESULTS: In Meghalaya there is high awareness and utilization of tribal  medicine, but no visible efforts by the public sector to support or engage with  healers. The AYUSH systems in contrast had little local acceptance but promotion  of these systems has led to a substantial increase in AYUSH doctors,  particularly homeopaths, in rural areas. Policy actors outside the health  department saw an important role for tribal medicine due to its popularity,  local belief in its efficacy and its cultural resonance. The need to engage with  healers to enhance referral, training, documentation and research of tribal  medicine was made. CONCLUSIONS: The wide acceptance of tribal medicine suggests that tribal  medicine needs to be supported. The results of the study question the process of  the implementation of the 'mainstreaming AYUSH' policy for Meghalaya and  highlight the importance of contextualizing health policy within the local  culture. A potential role for Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) at  sub-national levels is also highlighted.","According to ""Is 'mainstreaming AYUSH' the right policy for Meghalaya, northeast India?"", the tribal medicine of Meghalaya, an indigenous tribal traditional medicine, is widely accepted and utilized in the region.

What precautions should I take when using traditional Indian medicine to avoid heavy metal toxicity?,"Introduction: Ayurveda and Siddha are two important components of the  traditional Indian medicine (TIM). The regulatory mechanisms have been  insufficient, and heavy metal toxicity with TIM preparations continues to be a  public health nuisance, putting integrated medicine practice in jeopardy. The  current study was undertaken to review the potential health hazards of the heavy  metal content in the TIM and formulate patient-safety recommendations for  integrative medical practice. Materials and Methods: Systematic MEDLINE searches  were performed using a combination of relevant MeSH terms and keywords, and case  report/series of Ayurveda or Siddha-induced heavy metal toxicity, published in  the previous two decades, were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the tool  by Murad et al. Results: A total of 220 cases (51 case reports and 14 case  series) were found (lead, n = 156; arsenic, n = 11; mercury, n = 47; thallium,  n = 1; gold, n = 1; combination of heavy metals, n = 4) after screening for the  inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 169 (76.8%) had a low risk of  bias, 113 (out of 135 [83.7%] analyzed) contained higher-than-permissible heavy  metal content in the drug samples, and the majority showed elevated biological  levels of the heavy metals in the body. Conclusion: The heavy metals in TIM are  often the result of adulteration or improper manufacturing and prescribing  practices, despite national and international guidelines recommending quality  standards and protocols for preparing and dispensing TIM. We thus propose  multipronged approaches and provide recommendations at various levels, including  individual, institutional, national policy decisions essential to establish  patient safety of TIM.","According to ""Heavy Metals in Indian Traditional Systems of Medicine: A Systematic Scoping Review and Recommendations for Integrative Medicine Practice"", the traditional Indian medicine (TIM), which includes Ayurveda and Siddha, can potentially pose health hazards due to the heavy metal content in the preparations. This is often a result of adulteration or improper manufacturing and prescribing practices. The study found 220 cases of heavy metal toxicity induced by Ayurveda or Siddha, with metals including lead, arsenic, mercury, thallium, gold, and combinations of heavy metals. The majority of cases showed elevated biological levels of the heavy metals in the body. The paper recommends multipronged approaches at various levels, including individual, institutional, and national policy decisions"
What should I do if I have a bad reaction to an Ayurvedic medicine?,"Toxic epidermolysis necrosis (TEN) or Lyell syndrome is a potentially  life-threatening immunological adverse skin disease, which mostly occurs  secondary to the intake of an offending drug. It commonly manifests as a  widespread exfoliating bullous lesion in skin and mucous membrane mimicking  superficial burns and may result in hypovolemic and/or septic shock. Authors  report an unusual case of Lyell's syndrome in a 42-year-old woman, secondary to  the intake of Ayurveda medicine 'Vajra Bhasma' (Diamond Ash) prescribed by an  Ayurveda physician for treatment of her trigeminal neuralgia. After 8th day of  continuous medication intake, she had prodromal illness and rapidly developing  exfoliative skin lesion extended over 80% of total body surface area, breathing  difficulty, dizziness and anuria. The case was successfully managed by timely  diagnosis, adequate hydration and administration of immunoglobulins. After  17 days, the skin epithelium regenerated, and she improved clinically with some  depigmented lesions at discharge, which were normalised without any sequel  during her further follow-up visits in hospital. Identification and withdrawal  of the suspected drug, adequate resuscitation and early immunoglobulin  administration are critical in management of TEN.","According to ""Vajra Bhasma, Ayurvedic medicine: a rare and unusual cause of Lyell's syndrome and its successful management"", the Ayurvedic medicine 'Vajra Bhasma' (Diamond Ash) was identified as the cause of Lyell's syndrome in a 42-year-old woman. This was an unusual case where the woman developed the life-threatening skin disease after taking Vajra Bhasma for her trigeminal neuralgia. The condition was managed successfully by identifying and withdrawing the suspected drug, providing adequate hydration and administering immunoglobulins. After 17 days, her skin regenerated and her condition improved, with depigmented lesions normalizing during her follow-up visits in the hospital."
What are some Ayurvedic remedies for skin diseases as mentioned in the ancient palm-leaf manuscripts?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ancient India relied on manuscripts written by  scholars for storing, transferring and retrieving the information pertaining to  culture, traditions, religion, geography and political issues. Similarly,  Ayurveda, an ancient human health care management system in India and most of  its information is available through palm-leaf manuscripts. Though each  palm-leaf can persist for a fairly long time, it suffers gradual deterioration  owing to physical, chemincal and biological factors, thus warranting  digitiation. The palm-leaf manuscripts of Ayurveda are extensively studied for  finding new drug or treatment methods to new-age diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study concerns an unpublished ancient Telugu  palm-leaf manuscript containing Ayurvedic medicine information enscripted on 33  palm-leaves. Since the palm-leaf manuscript is very old, the manual  documentation, translation, digitization and analysis of it may shed light on  hidden ayurvedic information that may be useful to the modern society. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The palm-leaf manuscript with 33 folios were manually  documented and digitized into a Telugu book followed by translation into  English. The scientific names of historical diseases, plants, animals, metals  and minerals were identified based on published sources. RESULTS: A critical scrutiny of the palm-leaf manuscript revealed 120  formulations with 164 plants for 29 different kinds of diseases such as meha and  prameha (urinary problems), eye diseases, skin diseases, respiratory diseases,  fevers, digestive disorders, jaundice, tuberculosis, cancer and so on. Plant and  animal products, metals and minerals mentioned in the said formulations were  identified and listed. CONCLUSION: Basing on our study, it is concluded that the said manuscript  contains mono-or poly-herbo-mineral formulations for the treatment of various  ailments.This information can be incorporated into and compared with available  data bases to find out the effectiveness of the drug or formulation for any  given diseases. Further validation of the formulations can be done by  phytochemical and in vivo pharmacological assays.","According to ""Enumeration of various Ayurvedic formulations listed in an ancient palm-leaf manuscript of Rayalaseema region in Andhra Pradesh state, India"", the ancient Telugu palm-leaf manuscript revealed 120 Ayurvedic formulations with 164 plants for 29 different kinds of diseases.

Who were the practitioners of surgery in ancient times and how was their knowledge passed on?,"Surgery and Medicine are inseparably fused today as essential parts of the art  of heeling. Over the millennia of recorded history, Medicine and Surgery have  followed separate and largely independent evolutionary pertains. It is obvious  that medical care could not have been complete without some surgery in ancient  times. This branch of medical skill was not accepted as profession. The  practitioners were members of all low caste, who were illiterates and passed on  their knowledge by oral tradition rather than in writing. The barbers are  celebrity surgeons in ancient India and continued till the recent past it is  evident by Pandyan inscriptions of Tamilnadu of 7th-8th centuries A.D. The  barbers were also the surgeons in ancient and medieval Europe. śuśrta, a great  ancient Indian Surgeon, who is regarded as father of the surgery, designed  surgical equipment with innovative vision and described many surgical  procedures, which laid basis for many advanced technologies in this field.","According to ""Evolution of surgery--śuśrta's innovative skills"", the ancient Indian Surgeon śuśrta, also known as the father of surgery, designed innovative surgical equipment and described many surgical procedures that laid the groundwork for advanced technologies in the field of surgery."
Who is considered the god of Hindu medicine in Ayurveda?,"The original conception of Ayurveda in its entirety is essentially linked to  Dhanwantari who is considered as God of Hindu Medicine. Dhanwantari is  considered a mythical deity born with ambrosia in one hand and Ayurveda on the  other at the end of the churning of milk ocean. He reincarnated himself in the  Chandra dynasty. He was born to King Dhanwa, learnt Ayurveda from Bharadwaja.  His great grandson Divodasa was also known as Dhanwantari, but was specialised  only in surgical branch of Ayurveda.

How can Ayurvedic psychiatry contribute to mental health treatment?,"In this paper, the author traces two parallel movements of institutionalized  Ayurvedic psychiatry, an emergent field of specialization in Kerala, India: the  'work of purification' and the 'work of translation' that Latour has described  as characteristic of the 'modern constitution.' The author delineates these  processes in terms of the relationship of Ayurvedic psychiatry to (1) allopathic  psychiatry, (2) bhutavidya, a branch of textual Ayurveda dealing with spirits,  and (3) occult violence. The aim is to offer a model of these open and hidden  processes and of Ayurvedic psychiatry's positioning within a hierarchical mental  health field characterized simultaneously by biopsychiatric hegemony and a  persistent vernacular healing tradition. Through these processes, Ayurvedic  psychiatry emerges as a relevant actor. It demarcates itself from both  allopathic and vernacular epistemologies and ontologies while simultaneously  drawing upon aspects of each, and, in this way, shows itself to be both deeply  modern and highly pragmatic.","According to ""Translation and purification: Ayurvedic psychiatry, allopathic psychiatry, spirits and occult violence in Kerala, South India"", Ayurvedic psychiatry in Kerala, India is an emerging specialization that defines itself distinct from both allopathic psychiatry and vernacular healing traditions. It incorporates aspects from both these fields, demonstrating a modern and pragmatic approach. This involves a process of 'purification' and 'translation' as described by Latour in the 'modern constitution'. The field of Ayurvedic psychiatry also has connections to bhutavidya, a branch of Ayurveda that deals with spirits, and to occult violence."
How reliable is Ayurvedic diagnosis for knee osteoarthritis?,"Background: Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine. The customized  Ayurvedic approach consists of a combination of several diagnostic procedures  and subsequent individualized therapeutic interventions. Evaluation of  inter-rater reliability (IRR) of Ayurvedic diagnoses has rarely been performed.  The aim of this study was to evaluate IRR of Ayurvedic diagnosis for patients  with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A diagnostic reliability study of 30 patients  and 4 Ayurvedic experts was nested in a randomized controlled trial. Patients  were diagnosed in a sequential order by all experts utilizing a semistructured  patient history form. A nominal group technique as consensus procedure was  performed to reach agreement on the items to be diagnosed. An IRR analysis using  Fleiss' and Cohen's kappa statistics was performed to determine a  chance-corrected measure of agreement among raters. Results: One hundred and  twenty different ratings and 30 consensus ratings were performed and analyzed.  While high percentages of agreement for main diagnostic entities and the final  Ayurveda diagnosis (95% consensus agreement on main diagnosis) could be  observed, this was not reflected in the corresponding kappa values, which  largely yielded fair-to-poor inter-rater agreement kappas for central diagnostic  aspects such as prakriti and agni (κ values between 0 and 0.4). Notably,  agreement on disease-related entities was better than that on constitutional  entities. Conclusions: This is the first diagnostic study embedded in a clinical  trial on patients with knee osteoarthritis utilizing a multimodality whole  systems approach. Results showed a contrast between the high agreement of the  consented final diagnosis and disagreement on certain diagnostic details. Future  diagnostic studies should have larger sample sizes and a methodology more  tailored to the specificities of traditional whole systems of medicine. Equal  emphasis will need to be placed on all core diagnostic components of Ayurveda,  both constitutional and disease specific, using detailed structured history  taking forms.","According to ""Reliability of Ayurvedic Diagnosis for Knee Osteoarthritis Patients: A Nested Diagnostic Study Within a Randomized Controlled Trial,"" Ayurvedic diagnosis for knee osteoarthritis patients employs a multimodality whole systems approach that focuses on both constitutional and disease-specific factors.

How can Ayurvedic principles help in understanding and managing different types of psychosis?,"OBJECTIVE: This is a preliminary report on the development of a scale to measure  the symptoms of unmāda (psychosis) attributable to tridosa (metabolic  principles) by using the concepts of Ayurvedic medicine. DESIGN: The 67-item unmāda specific symptom scale was developed on the basis of  translation of Sanskrit verses describing vātaja (V), pittaja (P), and kaphaja  (K) unmāda (specific symptoms of psychosis due to the imbalances of metabolic  components) and by taking the opinions of experts (15 Ayurveda experts, 5  psychiatrists, and 5 psychologists). SETTINGS: The setting for this study was Spandana Psychiatric Nursing Home  Bangalore, India. SUBJECTS: The scale was administered by an unblinded assessor to 30 consecutive  patients with nonaffective psychotic disorders. RESULTS: The unmāda specific symptom scale was associated with excellent  internal consistency. The Cronbach's alpha for V, P, and K scales were 0.98,  0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The split-half reliability for V, P, and K scales  were 0.97, 0.97, and 0.88 respectively. Scores on vātaja, pittaja, and kaphaja  scales were inversely correlated, suggesting that they are mutually exclusive.  The three subgroups of psychoses--paranoid schizophrenia, schizophrenia  (unspecified), and unspecified nonorganic psychosis--had significantly different  loadings on the three scores, having high scores on vātaja, pittaja, and  kaphaja, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The tridoshas in psychotic disorders can be measured reliably by  this instrument. The scores on each of these doşas help in differentiating three  types of psychosis (according to Ayurveda) that have good correspondence with  prevailing classification. However, this scale must also be applied to the other  28 separate subcategories of the psychoses that are identified in the  International Statistical Classifications of Diseases (version 10) and to the 10  variants of psychosis as defined by the American Psychiatric Association  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-R to help better understand the true  utility for use here with the various subcategories of schizophrenia.","According to 'Measuring the tridosha symptoms of unmāda (psychosis): a preliminary study', the symptoms of unmāda (psychosis) can be measured using a scale developed based on Ayurvedic medicine principles.

What are some ancient exercise practices that can help prevent obesity and diabetes?,"When considering the history of exercise physiology, authors begin with  Hippocrates and the ""Golden Age"" of Greece before mentioning Galen and the  contributions from Rome. However, this approach has omitted the information from  the ancient civilizations of India which flourished before and during the  emergence of Mycenaen cultures. Specifically ignored have been 1) the tridosa  doctrine (humoral theory), which as early as 1500 B.C., emphasized that disease  occurred because of a displacement of one or more of the three humors, with  health being achieved when the humors were in equilibrium and 2) the perspective  of Susruta (Sushruta) who was a 600 B.C. physician who included exercise in his  prescriptions to prevent and treat diseases. Susruta not only advocated exercise  to maintain equilibrium among the humors, notably kapha, he promoted exercise to  minimize the consequences of obesity and diabetes. To be effective, exercise had  to be daily and moderate in intensity and never excessive or to exceed the  half-maximum limit for exhaustion, because disease or even death could ensue. It  is concluded that Susruta's concepts pertaining to chronic exercise and to the  health benefits of exercise were ""remarkably modern"" and that future authors on  the history of exercise physiology should include contributions from ancient  India.","According to ""Susruta of India, an unrecognized contributor to the history of exercise physiology"", Susruta, a physician from 600 B.C., advocated for daily and moderate intensity exercise as a method to maintain equilibrium among the three humors, notably kapha.

What are some of the active ingredients in traditional Ayurvedic recipes that might have psychoactive effects?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Food is medicine and vice versa. In Hindu and  Ayurvedic medicine, and among human cultures of the Indian subcontinent in  general, the perception of the food-medicine continuum is especially well  established. The preparation of the exhilarating, gold-coloured Soma, Amrita or  Ambrosia, the elixir and food of the 'immortals'-the Hindu pantheon-by the  ancient Indo-Aryans, is described in the Rigveda in poetic hymns. Different  theories regarding the botanical identity of Soma circulate, but no  pharmacologically and historically convincing theory exists to date. We intend  to contribute to the botanical, chemical and pharmacological characterisation of  Soma through an analysis of two historical Amrita recipes recorded in the Bower  Manuscript. The recipes are referred therein as panaceas (clarified butter) and  also as a medicine to treat nervous diseases (oil), while no exhilarating  properties are mentioned. Notwithstanding this, we hypothesise, that these  recipes are related to the ca. 1800 years older Rigvedic Soma. We suppose that  the psychoactive Soma ingredient(s) are among the components, possibly in  smaller proportions, of the Amrita recipes preserved in the Bower Manuscript. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Bower Manuscript is a medical treatise recorded in  the 6th century A.D. in Sanskrit on birch bark leaves, probably by Buddhist  monks, and unearthed towards the end of the 19th century in Chinese Turkestan.  We analysed two Amrita recipes from the Bower Manuscript, which was translated  by Rudolf Hoernle into English during the early 20th century. A database search  with the updated Latin binomials of the herbal ingredients was used to gather  quantitative phytochemical and pharmacological information. RESULTS: Together, both Amrita recipes contain around 100 herbal ingredients.  Psychoactive alkaloid containing species still important in Ayurvedic, Chinese  and Thai medicine and mentioned in the recipe for 'Amrita-Prâsa clarified  butter' and 'Amrita Oil' are: Tinospora cordifolia (Amrita, Guduchi), three Sida  spp., Mucuna pruriens, Nelumbo nucifera, Desmodium gangeticum, and  Tabernaemontana divaricata. These species contain several notorious and  potential psychoactive and psychedelic alkaloids, namely: tryptamines,  2-phenylethylamine, ephedrine, aporphines, ibogaine, and L-DOPA. Furthermore,  protoberberine alkaloids, tetrahydro-β-carbolines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines  with monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I) activity but also neurotoxic properties  are reported. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that Soma was a combination of a protoberberine  alkaloids containing Tinospora cordifolia juice with MAO-I properties mixed  together with a tryptamine rich Desmodium gangeticum extract or a blending of  Tinospora cordifolia with an ephedrine and phenylethylamine-rich Sida spp.  extract. Tinospora cordifolia combined with Desmodium gangeticum might provide a  psychedelic experience with visual effects, while a combination of Tinospora  cordifolia with Sida spp. might lead to more euphoric and amphetamine-like  experiences.","According to 'Soma, food of the immortals according to the Bower Manuscript (Kashmir, 6th century A.D.)', the key Ayurvedic remedy information relates to the Amrita recipes found in the Bower Manuscript, a medical treatise from the 6th century. These recipes are thought to be related to the Rigvedic Soma, a legendary beverage consumed by the Hindu gods. The recipes are described as panaceas and treatments for nervous diseases. The Amrita-Prâsa clarified butter and Amrita Oil recipes contain approximately 100 herbal ingredients, including Tinospora cordifolia (Amrita, Guduchi), three Sida species, Mucuna pruriens,"
Why do people in India prefer traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine over allopathic medicine?,"Background Albeit Indian system of medicine has been practised since long  however it has got recent prominence after some policy decisions made to make it  more accessible to the people of India. Methods A two fold search strategy was  adopted to obtain the literature; search through PUBMED and hand search through  cross references. Of the 58 articles obtained through both the search approaches  13 articles were finally included in the review. Results The studies reviewed  assessed the utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people  adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. Utilization was  observed in a particular geographical area (states) and by a specific group of  people such as tribal and general population, medical practitioners and  religious groups. Perception about AYUSH system was mixed with different  segments of the society. Preference among the general population revolved around  distrust or frustration with allopathic medicine, cost effectiveness,  accessibility, non-availability of other options and less side effects of AYUSH  medicines. Moreover people primarily adopted AYUSH systems of medicine based on  their personal experiences and recommended the same to other people as well.  Conclusions A mixed response was observed through this systematic review with  regard to utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people  adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India. A higher level of  awareness and governmental patronization is required to make it available to the  common man at the last corner of the society for the benefit of the former and  the system as well.","According to 'Utilization, preference, perception and characteristics of people adopting traditional and AYUSH systems of medicine in India: a systematic review', people in India primarily adopt AYUSH systems of medicine due to reasons such as distrust or dissatisfaction with allopathic medicine, cost effectiveness, accessibility, non-availability of other options, and fewer side effects. People are more likely to use AYUSH remedies in certain geographical areas and among certain groups such as the tribal population, medical practitioners, and religious groups. The perception and utilization of AYUSH treatments are mixed and based on personal experiences, which are often recommended to others. The study calls for increased awareness and government support to make AYUSH more accessible to all sections of society."
What are some reasons why people might choose traditional medical systems like AYUSH in India?,"For the first time, we have a comprehensive database on usage of AYUSH (acronym  for Ayurveda, naturopathy and Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) in India at  the household level. This article aims at exploring the spread of the  traditional medical systems in India and the perceptions of people on the access  and effectiveness of these medical systems using this database. The article uses  the unit level data purchased from the National Sample Survey Organization, New  Delhi. Household is the basic unit of survey and the data are the collective  opinion of the household. This survey shows that less than 30% of Indian  households use the traditional medical systems. There is also a regional pattern  in the usage of particular type of traditional medicine, reflecting the regional  aspects of the development of such medical systems. The strong faith in AYUSH is  the main reason for its usage; lack of need for AYUSH and lack of awareness  about AYUSH are the main reasons for not using it. With regard to source of  medicines in the traditional medical systems, home is the main source in the  Indian medical system and private sector is the main source in Homeopathy. This  shows that there is need for creating awareness and improving access to  traditional medical systems in India. By and large, the users of AYUSH are also  convinced about the effectiveness of these traditional medicines.","According to 'Spread of Traditional Medicines in India: Results of National Sample Survey Organization's Perception Survey on Use of AYUSH', less than 30% of Indian households use traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda, naturopathy and Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH).

Can Ayurvedic treatments be an effective alternative for female infertility?,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of female infertility has been growing globally in recent  years. In spite of improvements in medical strategies and the improved outcomes  for infertile couples, treatment attempts remain largely unsuccessful. A growing  number of patients pursue complementary and alternative medicine treatment  options like Ayurveda that offers a variety of inpatient and outpatient  treatments for infertility. CASE REPORT: A case of a 38 year-old woman with infertility of unknown origin is  presented. She received 18 conventional fertility treatments in 5 different  fertility centers and 3 different countries. After several complications, the  patient quitted conventional treatment and admitted to an Ayurvedic outpatient  clinic where she received a complex Ayurvedic treatment, which included  botanicals, dietary and lifestyle advice, manual therapy, yoga, and spiritual  elements. The patient then became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy boy in  2012. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurveda may be a useful complementary option in the case of futile  conventional treatment attempts in female infertility. Nevertheless, the  evidence base for Ayurvedic interventions remains weak and requires  well-designed clinical trials. This case raises some questions, such as whether  the exposure to a large number of assisted reproduction procedures can lead to  more health problems than health benefits. The Ayurvedic approach to fertility  strives first to improve the health of the patient leading to a higher  likelihood of pregnancy. As this is a case report, we are not able to exclude  temporal factors stimulating the pregnancy. However, the chronology suggests  that this approach might have been an important factor in the eventual  pregnancy.","According to 'The Effect of a Complex Multi-modality Ayurvedic Treatment in a Case of Unknown Female Infertility', a 38-year-old woman with infertility of unknown origin successfully conceived and gave birth to a healthy boy after receiving a complex Ayurvedic treatment.

He was the son of Indukara according to the  colophon of a manuscript of Văcaspati's commentary on Mădhava Nidăna. He is  probably lived between 700-800 A.D., because he is quoted by Vrnda, who belongs  to 8th century A.D. The book Mădhava Nidăna was translated in to Arabic as  evidenced by the writings of Ali Ibn Sahl 849-850 A.D. and other Arabic authors.  Hence, he probably lived between 700-800 A.D.

How is the toxicity of Nux vomica seeds reduced in Ayurvedic medicine preparation?,"Strychnos nux vomica Linn.(Loganaceae) commonly known as Nux vomica (Kupeelu),  is a poisonous plant and its seeds are used widely in Ayurvedic system of  medicine since time immemorial. Ayurveda advocates that nux vomica seeds are to  be administered in therapeutics only after going through certain purificatory  measures (Shodhana). There are more than six media: cow's urine (Go mutra),  cow's milk (Go dugdha), cow's ghee (Go ghrita), Kanji (thin gruel), castor oil  (Eranda taila) and fresh ginger juice (Ardraka swarasa) etc., which have been  reported in different classical texts of Ayurveda for proper processing of nux  vomica seeds. In this study, an attempt has been made to purify the seeds by  using three different methods as described in ancient treatise by using cow's  urine and cow's milk as media alone and together. This study revealed that all  the methods studied reduced the toxicity of strychnine and brucine contents in  comparison to the raw seeds as determined by HPTLC. Out of these three methods  maximum reduction in strychnine and brucine contents was found when the seeds  were purified by keeping them in cow's urine for seven days followed by boiling  in cow's milk for three hrs.","According to ""Effect of purificatory measures through cow's urine and milk on strychnine and brucine content of Kupeelu (Strychnos nuxvomica Linn.) seeds"", seeds from the Nux vomica plant are used in Ayurvedic medicine but must be purified before therapeutic use. The purification process involves different media such as cow's urine, cow's milk, cow's ghee, thin gruel, castor oil, and fresh ginger juice. The study found that the seeds' toxicity was most reduced when they were kept in cow's urine for seven days and then boiled in cow's milk for three hours."
"How can Ayurveda help in managing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus?","Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are increasing to epidemic  proportions globally. There are 400 million clinically obese adults worldwide  and there are more than 220 million people who have diabetes. The global impact  of these disorders is immense in terms of human suffering and economic burden.  There is an urgent need for a more effective understanding of these disease  processes and their management, including the use of natural strategies that are  affordable and efficacious. The health care system known as Ayurveda has much to  offer in this regard. Ayurveda describes a set of complex clinical disorders,  collectively called Prameha, that are characterized by frequent abnormal  micturition. The clinical conditions associated with Prameha correlate in many  ways with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. The etiology,  classification, pathogenesis, and management of Prameha are discussed at length  and in detail in the Ayurvedic texts. The theoretical background and  comprehensive set of strategies Ayurveda utilizes to treat Prameha may be  valuable in managing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus in an  efficacious and cost-effective manner.","According to ""Ayurvedic concept of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus"", Ayurveda describes a set of clinical disorders called Prameha that are characterized by frequent abnormal micturition.

References with regard to Jwara are also  found in other non-medical literature Viz., Mahābhārata, Purānas etc. Acārya  Suśruta has mentioned that, man comes to this world with Jwara and departs with  it. Jwara affects the whole body, the organs of senses and also the mind.  According to mythology, Jwara was originated from the hot and destructive breath  of Lord Siva, which was produced from his nostrils during the paroxysms of grief  and rage on the death of his wife, Durga. It attacks all persons of all ages and  in all conditions. Jwara is the king of all diseases, destroyer of all creatures  and severe hence a physician should be practically cautious in treating it. All  these medico-historical aspects of Jwara have been presented in this article.","According to ""JWARA (fever)- a medico historical perspective"", the Ayurvedic remedies prescribed for the management of Jwara (fever) include drugs such as Kustha, Jangida, and Anjana."
What are some ways Ayurveda or Yoga can be integrated into my daily health routine?,"The government of India has, over the past decade, implemented the ""integration""  of traditional, complementary and alternative medical (TCAM) practitioners,  specifically practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha,  Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy (collectively known by the acronym AYUSH), in  government health services. A range of operational and ethical challenges has  manifested during this process of large health system reform. We explored the  practices and perceptions of health system actors, in relation to AYUSH  providers' roles in government health services in three Indian states - Kerala,  Meghalaya, and Delhi. Research methods included 196 in-depth interviews with a  range of health policy and system actors and beneficiaries, between February and  October 2012, and review of national, state, and district-level policy documents  relating to AYUSH integration. The thematic 'framework' approach was applied to  analyze data from the interviews, and systematic content analysis performed on  policy documents. We found that the roles of AYUSH providers are frequently  ambiguously stated and variably interpreted, in relation to various aspects of  their practice, such as outpatient care, prescribing rights, emergency duties,  obstetric services, night duties, and referrals across systems of medicine. Work  sharing is variously interpreted by different health system actors as  complementing allopathic practice with AYUSH practice, or allopathic practice,  by AYUSH providers to supplement the work of allopathic practitioners.  Interactions among AYUSH practitioners and their health system colleagues  frequently take place in a context of partial information, preconceived notions,  power imbalances, and mistrust. In some notable instances, collegial  relationships and apt divisions of responsibilities are observed. Widespread  normative ambivalence around the roles of AYUSH providers, complicated by the  logistical constraints prevalent in poorly resourced systems, has the potential  to undermine the therapeutic practices and motivation of AYUSH providers, as  well as the overall efficiency and performance of integrated health services.","The research paper ""Getting the water-carrier to light the lamps"": Discrepant role perceptions of traditional, complementary, and alternative medical practitioners in government health facilities in India"" doesn't provide specific Ayurvedic remedies. However, it discusses the integration of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-rigpa, and Homoeopathy (collectively known as AYUSH) practitioners into government health services in India. The roles of these AYUSH providers in the health system are ambiguously stated and interpreted differently, including aspects like outpatient care, prescribing rights, emergency duties, obstetric services, night duties, and referrals across different systems of medicine.

What benefits can I get from using the Tri-phalā combination in traditional Ayurvedic medicine?,"In India, since ancient times Tri-phalā (meaning ""three fruits"" in Sanskrit) has  been considered to be a combination of the following fruits: -Harītakī  (Terminalia chebula, Retz.), Āmalaka (Embelica officinalis Gaertn), and  Vibhītaka (Terminalia belerica Roxb.). These plants are also listed in the  Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Harītakī and Āmalaka have also been used for  medicinal purposes since ancient times in Japan under the Japanese names of (see  text) (Kariroku) and (see text) (Annmaroku), respectively. Both have been  carefully preserved as treasured drugs in the nationally important Shosoin  treasure storehouse. This study attempts to clarify the description of Tri-phalā  in the Nāvanītaka, which is the second part of the Bower Manuscript (Bower Ms.),  and examines the reasons why these plants were combined. This paper begins with  a summary description of Tri-phalā in the context of traditional Asian medicine,  followed by the delineation of drug selection principles in Ayurveda. Tri-phalā  formulas in the Nāvanītaka are then examined. The Carakasamhitā (CS) treats  Tri-phalā as a purifier and tonic (rasāyana), describing it as a formula for  rejuvenation and longevity. On the other hand, the Susrutasamhitd (SS) regards  Tri-phalā as having the efficacy of balancing kapha (phlegm) and pitta (bile),  and also as being a medicine to promote excretion and enhance digestive  functions for better nutritional intake. It is described to have an effect of  curing diseases by keeping the tridhāu (theree element) valance. Tri-phalā is  thus used as an ingredient of laxatives for diseases that result from kapha  imbalance and tonic. The Aşţāngahŗdayasamhitā (AHS) considers Tri-phalā to have  a particular superiority among cure-all medicines with the power to dispel  illness. It controls kapha and overcomes blood diseases. Tri-phalā formulas  found in the Nāvanītaka were prescribed for the treatment of abdominal tumors  induced by vāyu (wind) disorder as well as for coughs caused by pitta and kapha  disorder. Tri-phalā was also administered to facilitate nutrient absorption,  regulate bowel function, and promote excretion. Tri-phalā thus restores the  balance of tridhāu by facilitating water distribution in the body. For these  reasons, the optimal combination of Tri-phalā was then established to adjust  kapha for most efficient purification effects.","According to the paper ""Tri-phalā (Three Myrobalans) as Described in the Second Part of the Bower Manuscript, the Nāvanītaka"", Tri-phalā is a combination of three fruits: Harītakī (Terminalia chebula, Retz.), Āmalaka (Embelica officinalis Gaertn), and Vibhītaka (Terminalia belerica Roxb).

Which aromatic herbs have been found to have antibacterial properties?,"The aromatic substances of natural origin are used medicinally in Ayurveda, and  can have diverse bio-dynamic actions. The existing methods like agar-cup method  or disc diffusion method are not adequate to study the exclusive antibacterial  effects of the volatile components of aromatic oils due to lack of ideal  diffusion and evaporation from the surface. Hence an attempt is made to develop  a novel approach to assess the antibacterial activity of few aromatic herbs like  Eugenia caryophyllus, Thymus vulgaris, Cinnamonum zeylanium, Cuminum cyminum;  these were extracted with hexane filled in tiny sterile tubes and the volatile  components were tested for their antibacterial properties using standard strains  of gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria grown on agar slants.

What natural remedies were used in ancient India to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism was identified in ancient India even  before the period of Christ and was treated methodically. The earliest reference  to bradykinesia dates to 600 bc. Evidences prove that as early as 300 bc,  Charaka proposed a coherent picture of parkinsonism by describing tremor,  rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances as its components. The scenario  was further developed by Madhava, Vagbhata, and Dalhana all through history. The  15th-century classic ""Bhasava rajyam"" introduced the term kampavata, which may  be regarded as an ayurvedic analogue of parkinsonism. The pathogenesis of  kampavata centered on the concept of imbalance in the vata factor, which  controls psychomotor activities. The essential element in therapy was the  administration of powdered seed of Mucuna pruriens, or atmagupta, which as per  reports, contains 4%-6% of levodopa. In addition to proving the existence and  identification of parkinsonism in ancient India, the study points to the  significance of ancient Indian Sanskrit works in medical history.","According to ""The history of parkinsonism: descriptions in ancient Indian medical literature"", the Ayurvedic remedy for parkinsonism, also referred to as kampavata, centers on the administration of powdered seed of Mucuna pruriens, or atmagupta.

The Mucuna pruriens seed reportedly contains 4%-6% of levodopa, a substance used in modern treatments for Parkinson's disease."
What are some traditional treatments for plaque psoriasis?,"OBJECTIVES: Plaque psoriasis is very embarrassing condition of skin as it  produces itchy rashes and scaly lesions which may not respond well to the  treatment. It can be correlated with Kitibhakushta which is one among the 18  types of Kushta (skin diseases). Several corticosteroids for skin applications  are used now a day's which gives only temporary relief. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36 years old moderate built male patient complains of  blackish skin rashes with itching, pain and scaling all over the body for three  months. Based on the symptoms, Dosha (Biological humors) involved were assessed  as Kapha (binding factors) and Vata (vital force of life) and suggestive of  Kitibhakushta. Diagnosis of the Plaque psoriasis was further confirmed by  biopsy. Classical Kushta treatment was adopted here. As Poorvakarma  (pre-operative procedures), Rukshana (Dehydrating therapy) was done and then  Snehapana (intake of medicated ghee) was administered. Then classical Vamana  (emetic therapy) and Virechana (purgative therapy) were performed. This took  almost one month. After Samsarjana (special diet) patient was administered  Manibhadragula as Shodhana Rasayana for a period of one month. At the end of  Manibhadragula intake, remarkable changes were observed in all the symptoms.  There were significant changes seen in PASI, DLQI and photographs taken before  and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Here the special mode of administration of Manibhadragula as  mentioned in Ashtanga Hridaya helps for Shodhana and the Shodhana itself has  Rasayana action. Drugs also have Rasayana property. This made the authors to  propose a new concept called Shodhana Rasayana.

What are some herbal remedies for treating and managing urinary stones?,"ETHANOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The process of formation or appearance of a  urinary stone anywhere in the renal tract is known as urolithiasis. It is a  longstanding health problem, known to exist since early age of civilization.  Records about symptoms, signs and treatment strategies of urinary stones  diseases are found in the several ancient texts of traditional medicines such as  Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Siddha and Unani. In Ayurveda,  urolithiasis has been considered as one of the eight most troublesome diseases.  Ayurvedic management and cure of urinary stone involves herbal formulas,  alkaline liquids and surgical procedures. Whereas, TCM recommends polyherbal  drugs, acupuncture and mexibustion for treatment of the urinary stones. Among  these therapies, herbal remedies are in practice till today for the treatment  and cure urinary stone diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature about  pathophysiology of urinary stones and antiurolithiatic plants was undertaken  using the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of  Knowledge and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from publications from  all years until Dec., 2015 by combination of the search terms and Boolean  operators; 'urinary stone' OR 'kidney stone' AND 'plant' OR 'medicine' OR  'antiurolithiatic plants'. Outputs were restricted to those completed studies  only published in English. In this review, literatures about plants which are  used as diuretic and/or in treatment urinary tract infections have not also been  considered. The Plant List and Royal Botanical Garden, Kew databases were used  to authenticate botanical names of plants. Books and monographs published in  English were used to collect information about historical records of  antiurolithiatic plants. RESULTS: Recent pharmacological interventions accredited ancient  antiurolithiatic claims to several plants and their formulations. The majority  of antiurolithiatic plants were found to either dissolve the stones or inhibit  the process of urinary stone formation. Plants such as Phyllanthus niruri L. and  Elymus repens (L.) Gould, as well as herbal products including 'Wu-Ling-San'  formula, 'Cystone' and 'Herbmed' have been proved their utility as promising  antiurolithiatic medicines in the different phases of clinical trials. In  addition, some of the isolated phytochemicals such as berberine, lupeol, khelin,  visnagin, 7-hydroxy-2',4',5'-trimethoxyisoflavone and  7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone were reported to have potent antiurolithiatic  activity. CONCLUSION: In ancient medicinal texts, antiurolithiatic potential has been  ascribed to several plants and their formulations. Present scientific studies  provide scientific evidences for few of these claims however, they are  insufficient to establish many of these plants and herbal formulations as  therapeutic remedies for the treatment and management of urinary stones.  Conversely, findings of pre-clinical and clinical studies about some plants and  herbal formulations are promising, which underlines the utility of herbal  remedies as alternative medicines for the treatment and management of urinary  stones in the future.","According to ""Herbal remedies for urinary stones used in India and China: A review"", Ayurvedic treatment for urinary stones, also known as urolithiasis, includes the use of herbal formulas, alkaline liquids, and surgical procedures.

Articles  published prior to March 2022, 10 or more patients that investigated Ayurveda as  a treatment for CRS in humans were included. This resulted in thirteen articles  meeting inclusion criteria. Ayurvedic treatments included herbal medications for  oral consumption, nasal instillation, and steam inhalation used alone or in  combination. All studies concluded that Ayurvedic therapy led to improvements in  subjective CRS symptoms and objective radiographic and hematologic criteria.  However, all 13 studies had a significant risk of bias due to study design and  statistical methods utilized. SUMMARY: Ayurvedic therapy may be a useful CRS treatment for some patients and  overall appears to be well tolerated. However, definitive recommendation for  when Ayurvedic treatments would be beneficial in the treatment of CRS remains  not possible. OUTLOOK: Given the overall positive effects shown in the current published  evidence and growing interest in complementary and integrative therapies,  Ayurvedic treatments for CRS deserve further investigation in the form of  well-designed controlled trials.","According to ""Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis: a systematic review of randomized and non-randomized trials"", Ayurvedic treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) include oral consumption of herbal medications, nasal instillation, and steam inhalation used either individually or in combination.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments that may help with symptoms of facial paralysis?,"BACKGROUND: Ardita (facial paralysis) is a medical condition that disfigures or  distorts the facial appearance of the sufferer causing facial asymmetry and  malfunction. Ardita patients may benefit from considering alternative treatments  such as Ayurveda, including Taila Nasya (nasal instillation of medicated oil). OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in the treatment of Ardita. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Studies conducted on adult sufferers  (18-70 years) of Ardita (chronic or acute) in any setting were considered.  Studies including participants who were pregnant or suffered allergic rhinitis,  fever, intracranial tumor/hemorrhage and bilateral facial palsy were excluded. INTERVENTION(S)/COMPARATOR(S): Standalone treatment of Nasya (at all dosages and  frequencies) compared to Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic treatments  was considered. Comparisons between different interventions including Taila  Nasya alone, Taila Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic interventions and  Ayurvedic interventions that did not include Taila Nasya were also considered. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Ardita symptoms, including facial distortion,  speech disorders and facial pain, were measured. TYPES OF STUDIES: All quantitative study designs (experimental,  quasi-experimental and observational) were considered. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant studies were identified following a comprehensive  literature search. References provided within these key studies identified  additional resources. Indian universities were also contacted for results of  Ardita studies undertaken in their institutions.A three-step search strategy  aimed to find studies of published and unpublished studies was undertaken.  Studies published in the English language were considered for inclusion,  irrespective of publication date/year. Following an initial limited search of  MEDLINE and CINAHL, the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of  the index terms used to describe each articles were analyzed. From the  identified keywords and index terms, searches were undertaken across all  relevant databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus, Centre  for Review and Dissemination databases, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP),  EMBASE, EBM Reviews, DHARA, Google Scholar, MedNar and ProQuest Dissertations.  Finally, reference lists of identified theses and articles were searched for  additional studies. Universities and website operators related to Ayurvedic  research in India were contacted, including the National Institute of Ayurveda  for relevant studies. Besides this, the University of Adelaide librarian was  contacted to retrieve those studies identified in the reference lists of theses  and articles. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were critically assessed by the review author  and a secondary reviewer prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized  critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted by the primary reviewer using the  standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Different interventions and comparators across studies precluded  meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Only two pseudo randomized studies with a small number of participants  met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study with 20  participants, divided equally into two groups compared the effectiveness of two  nasal instillations in alleviating four Ardita symptoms. The second study of 15  participants each in two groups compared the effectiveness of nasal instillation  with placement of medicated oil on the head on seven Ardita symptoms.  Observational measurements of Ardita symptoms were graded as Mild, Moderate or  Marked at baseline and after one month. The study conducted on 30 participants  using Nasya intervention showed participants had better relief from the symptoms  of facial pain, speech disorder and earache within the range of 78.2% to 90.9%,  graded as Marked. Along with statistical data available in the studies, this  review found low levels of evidence favoring Taila Nasya intervention. The  review did not include any studies examining effectiveness of Nasya compared to  conventional treatment for Ardita. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents extremely limited evidence from only two small  experimental studies that administration of Nasya oil alone may provide some  relief from Ardita symptoms of facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to  shut eyelids/upward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. No  strong conclusions may be drawn from the evidence included in the review due to  the limited number of studies, limited number of participants and poor quality  of studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Practitioners should advice Ardita patients that  there is extremely limited evidence suggesting the potential effectiveness of  Nasya oils alone or Nasya in conjunction with other Ayurvedic treatments in  managing symptoms. However, given the absence of a strong evidence base,  practitioners should be guided by clinical wisdom and patient preference. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Well controlled clinical trials comparing standalone  Nasya therapy to other Ayurvedic treatments and/or conventional medicine for  Ardita symptoms need to be conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in treating Ardita.","According to ""The effectiveness of ayurvedic oil-based nasal instillation (Nasya) medicines in the treatment of facial paralysis (Ardita): a systematic review"", the Ayurvedic remedy of Taila Nasya, which involves nasal instillation of medicated oil, may provide some relief from symptoms of Ardita (facial paralysis). This includes symptoms such as facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to shut eyelids/upward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. However, the evidence is extremely limited and comes from only two small experimental studies.

Can the root of Pongamia Pinnata be used to treat inflammation and ulcers?,"Pongamia pinnata root has been advocated in Ayurveda for treatment of various  inflammatory and infective conditions including ulcers. Sequential petroleum  ether, benzene, chloroform, acetone and ethanolic extracts of P. pinnata roots  when administered in the dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p. in rats was found to have  anti-inflammatory, analgesic activity while pentobarbitone-induced 'sleep time'  was reduced by all the extracts except petroleum ether which, however, enhanced  it. They were also found to possess antiulcer effects when administered either  by i.p. (45 min before) or oral route (45 min before or for 4 days) against  restraint-stress or pylorus-ligated gastric ulcers in rats, the maximum  protection being afforded by petroleum ether and ethanol extracts. The mechanism  of antiulcer effect could either be due to decrease in acid-pepsin secretion and  augmentation of mucin secretion as observed with ethanol extract, while  petroleum ether extract might be producing the effect by virtue of its  anti-stress activity.","According to ""Pharmacological actions of Pongamia pinnata roots in albino rats"", the root of Pongamia pinnata, when administered in doses of 50mg/kg, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antiulcer effects. The root extract can be administered either intraperitoneally 45 minutes prior, or orally 45 minutes prior or continuously for 4 days. The maximum protection against ulcers was observed with petroleum ether and ethanol extracts of P. pinnata roots.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission on  different levels showed that the cold and dry climate, hot wind and relative  humid wind, maximum wind speed, turbulent wind, intensified recirculating flow  were causing transmission higher than factors. The role of environmental factors  described in Ayurveda like air, water, soil, season, frequent earthquakes,  sunlight exposure, frequent thunderstorm with lightening, and factors from  arthropods were revalidated in perspective of COVID-19 transmission. The authors  searched the information regarding epidemic diseases in Ayurveda textbooks.  Pubmed, Science Direct, Wikipedia, Elsevier, Lancet, and Springer were  approached for the latest knowledge relating to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Google  Scholar search engine was thoroughly checked upon for scientific evidence  regarding the Ayurveda drugs. Various environmental factors like soil, air,  water, frequent earthquake disasters, wildlife animals, aquatic birds, space,  inevitable disastrous factors, weather or seasonal hazards, violent thunderstorm  with lightning, intermediate hosts, sunlight exposure etc. were considered for  their role in the genesis of the disease. The Ayurvedic concepts behind the  etiology and development of epidemics are the same as modern epidemiological  theories. The mysteries of many aspects of the current pandemic might be  deciphered by traditional medicine knowledge and thus adding upon to the  integrative medicine concept.","According to 'Transmission modes of COVID-19 disease pandemic in the light of ancient wisdom of Ayurveda medicine: a review', the role of environmental factors like air, water, soil, season, frequent earthquakes, sunlight exposure, frequent thunderstorms with lightning, and factors from arthropods were revalidated in perspective of COVID-19 transmission. These factors are important in the Ayurvedic understanding of the genesis of diseases and epidemics. The study suggests that traditional Ayurvedic knowledge might help in understanding many aspects of the current pandemic, contributing to the concept of integrative medicine."
Is Ayurveda an effective treatment for osteoarthritis?,"Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing systems within complementary and  alternative medicine. However, the evidence for its effectiveness is  unsatisfactory. The aim of this work was to review and meta-analyze the  effectiveness and safety of different Ayurvedic interventions in patients with  osteoarthritis (OA). 138 electronic databases were searched through August 2013.  Randomized controlled trials, randomized crossover studies, cluster-randomized  trials, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials were eligible. Adults with  pre-diagnosed OA were included as participants. Interventions were included as  Ayurvedic if they were explicitly labeled as such. Main outcome measures were  pain, physical function, and global improvement. Risk of bias was assessed using  the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 19 randomized and 14 non-randomized controlled  trials on 12 different drugs and 3 non-pharmaceutical interventions with a total  of 2,952 patients were included. For the compound preparation, Rumalaya, large  and apparently unbiased effects beyond placebo were found for pain (standardized  mean difference [SMD] -3.73; 95 % confidence interval [CI] -4.97, -2.50; P <  0.01) and global improvement (risk ratio 12.20; 95 % CI 5.83, 25.54; P < 0.01).  There is also some evidence that effects of the herbal compound preparation  Shunti-Guduchi are comparable to those of glucosamine for pain (SMD 0.08; 95 %  CI -0.20, 0.36; P = 0.56) and function (SMD 0.15; 95 % CI -0.12, 0.36; P =  0.41). Based on single trials, positive effects were found for the compound  preparations RA-11, Reosto, and Siriraj Wattana. For Boswellia serrata, Lepidium  Sativum, a Boswellia serrata containing multicomponent formulation and the  compounds Nirgundi Taila, Panchatikta Ghrita Guggulu, and Rhumayog, and for  non-pharmacological interventions like Ayurvedic massage, steam therapy, and  enema, no evidence for significant effects against potential methodological bias  was found. No severe adverse events were observed in all trials. The drugs  Rumalaya and Shunti-Guduchi seem to be safe and effective drugs for treatment of  OA-patients, based on these data. However, several limitations relate to  clinical research on Ayurveda. Well-planned, well-conducted and well-published  trials are warranted to improve the evidence for Ayurvedic interventions.","According to ""Ayurvedic interventions for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis"", the compound preparation Rumalaya showed large and apparently unbiased effects beyond placebo for pain relief and global improvement in osteoarthritis patients.

What are some benefits of practicing the martial art kalarippayattu for overall body health?,"This paper describes three interconnected conceptions of the body in  kalarippayattu, the martial tradition of Kerala, South India. It traces  continuities and discontinuities among concepts and practices recorded in  classic source texts and contemporary martial practice for each of the three  'bodies of practice'. The first is the fluid body of humors and saps. The second  is the body as superstructure composed of bones, muscles, and vital spots  (marma-s), which supports the fluid body. The concepts and practices of the  first two bodies are based on the regional tradition of Ayurveda. They  constitute the external physical body (sthula-śarira). The third, subtle or  interior body (suksma-śarira) is thought to be encased within the physical body.  It provides an experiential map of practice and is the basis for higher stages  of meditation. The long-term practice of the martial art (1) makes the body  fluid so that healthful congruence of the humors occurs, (2) establishes an  intuitive and practical knowledge of vital points (marma) useful in fighting  (prayogam) and in treating injuries, and (3) purifies the subtle body and  awakens the internal vital energy (prana-vayu) that is manifest as the power  (śakti) of the master in combat or medical practice. The paper concludes with a  discussion of the interrelationship between these three concepts of the body in  the accomplished practice of the martial practitioner.","According to 'Three bodies of practice in a traditional South Indian martial art', the Ayurvedic practices in the martial tradition of kalarippayattu in Kerala, South India, involve understanding and maintaining three different 'bodies of practice'.

What are some plants that have been studied for their potential to help the body adapt to stress?,"Plants from all over the world such as Eleutherococcus senticosus, Panax  ginseng, Raponticum carthamoides, Rhodiola rosea, Withania somnifera and Ocimum  sanctum have been extensively evaluated for their adaptogenic potential.  However, none of them has been successfully introduced as an adaptogen in the  clinic. This paper discusses some of the problems in evaluation of adaptogens  which have precluded their inclusion as clinically useful drugs. We further  discuss our results with six rasayana plants from Ayurveda, which were studied  for their adaptogenic potential. The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of  selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis,  Withania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered  orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose,  following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and  chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these  stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective  parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced  alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a  normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.  All the plants reversed the effects of cisplatin on gastric emptying, while  Tinospora cordifolia and Asparagus racemosus also normalized cisplatin induced  intestinal hypermotility. Tinospora cordifolia was also tested for its ability  to modulate the changes occurring in the phagocytic activity of peritoneal  macrophages after exposure of rats to either carbon tetrachloride or horse  serum. It was found to normalize the phagocytic function irrespective to the  direction of change, complying to the definition of an adaptogen. All the plant  drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies  on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced  immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress  induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked.  Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical  damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to  depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent  data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia suggest that it may induce genotypic  adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.","According to ""Adaptogenic properties of six rasayana herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine"", six Ayurvedic plants, namely Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withania somnifera, Piper longum, and Terminalia chebula, have shown adaptogenic potential.

Are herbal drugs from certain regions safer due to lower levels of toxic metals?,"Traditionally, the herbal drugs are well established for their therapeutic  benefits. Depending upon their geographical sources sometimes the trace and  heavy metals' content may differ, which may lead to severe toxicity. So, the  toxicological and safety assessment of these herbal drugs are one of the major  issues in recent days. Eight different plant species including Aloe vera,  Centella asiatica, Calendula officinalis, Cucumis sativus, Camellia sinensis,  Clitoria ternatea, Piper betel and Tagetes erecta were selected to determine  their heavy and trace metals content and thereby to assure their safer  therapeutic application. The trace and heavy metals were detected through atomic  absorption spectrometry analysis. The selected medicinal plant materials were  collected from the local cultivated regions of West Bengal, India, and were  digested with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid as specified. Absorbance was  measured through atomic absorption spectrometer (AA 303) and the concentration  of different trace and heavy metals in the plant samples were calculated. The  quantitative determinations were carried out using standard calibration curve  obtained by the standard solutions of different metals. The contents of heavy  metals were found to be within the prescribed limit. Other trace metals were  found to be present in significant amount. Thus, on the basis of experimental  outcome, it can be concluded that the plant materials collected from the  specific region are safe and may not produce any harmful effect of metal  toxicity during their therapeutic application. The investigated medicinal plants  contain trace metals such as copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron  (Fe) and nickel (Ni) as well as heavy metals such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and  mercury (Hg), which were present within the permissible limit.","According to ""Determination of trace and heavy metals in some commonly used medicinal herbs in Ayurveda"", eight different plant species including Aloe vera, Centella asiatica, Calendula officinalis, Cucumis sativus, Camellia sinensis, Clitoria ternatea, Piper betel and Tagetes erecta were tested for their heavy and trace metals content to ensure their safe therapeutic use.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments or medicinal plants that could help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants like Mucuna pruriens L.(DC) and  Withania somnifera L.(Dunal) have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to  manage neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. AIM: The aim of this review is to share the role of Ayurveda's insights,  traditional usage and contemporary investigations for translational, integrative  applications to manage Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High impact journals for Parkinson's diseases,  traditional textbooks from Ayurveda as well as relevant clinical and para  clinical studies with botanicals are selectively incorporated to evolve the  aforesaid translational application. RESULTS: . A. CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING AND EXISTING THERAPEUTIC GAPS: Parkinson's disease  (PD) is a complex multi-system, neurodegenerative disease. Though predominantly  perceived as a motor disease, it also has debilitating non- motor features,  which are frequently missed and not treated. Major treatment goals are to  increase striatal dopamine levels with precursor-substitution and/or reduce its  breakdown. As the disease progresses, a steady increase in the dose of levodopa  is inevitable. However, higher doses cause motor complications of dyskinesia and  dystonia and compromise medical treatment. B. ROLE OF MUCUNA PRURIENS L.DC), THE  MOST PROMISING BOTANICAL FROM AYURVEDA: Ayurveda offers a natural source of  levodopa - the seeds of Mucuna pruriens L.(DC)- which have a long standing safe  use in the condition. Its clinical studies have shown pharmacokinetic profile  distinct from synthetic levodopa, which is likely to reduce the untoward motor  complications. Additionally, its seed extracts have shown neuroprotective  benefits which are unrelated to levodopa. C. AYURVEDIC REGIMENS AND MEDICINAL  PLANTS FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE AND SYMPTOMATIC BENEFITS: Other regimens  (Panchakarma) and medicinal plants used in Ayurveda have been subjected to  exploratory studies with promising early results in the condition. The  debilitating non motor symptoms in patients have shown response with one of the  regimens - medicated oil enema (basti). Effects of two medicinal plants Withania  somnifera(L.)Dunal and Curcuma longa Linn in Parkinson's Disease related models  have been discussed in detail. We have also shared a shortlist of medicinal  plants most likely to be useful in management of specific features of the  disease such as cognitive decline, mood disorders, risk of osteoporosis amongst  others. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda with its medicinal plants and treatment approaches, can  strengthen the therapeutic armamentarium of PD to improve clinical outcomes, if  these leads are systematically further investigated by well-designed longer term  studies.","According to 'Management of Parkinson's disease in Ayurveda: Medicinal plants and adjuvant measures', Mucuna pruriens L.(DC) and Withania somnifera L.(Dunal) are two medicinal plants used in Ayurvedic medicine to manage Parkinson's disease.

What are the key principles of Ayurveda for leading a healthy and long life?,"Āyurveda, the science (ved) of life (ayu), owing its origin to Veda, the oldest  recorded wisdom of human civilization written in 3500 BCE, contains extensive  knowledge of various diseases and their therapeutic approaches. It essentially  relied on nature and the immune system of an individual, and therapeutic  interventions were introduced only to augment the immune system. Āyurveda had  eight specialties, including psycho-neuroscience (a combination of psychology,  clinical psychology and psychiatry) and a unique promotive therapy encompassing  nutrition, rejuvenation and geriatrics. The symptoms of various brain disorders,  including memory disorder, were well defined. The goal of Āyurveda was to help  an individual to achieve his cherished goal of leading a healthy life of 100  years. To achieve this, great emphasis was laid on nutrition, diet and a good  conduct by the two great exponents of Āyurveda viz. Carak and Suśruta. By  following these regimens, an individual could lead a less stressful life free  from emotional disturbances. Both Carak and Suśruta had believed that these in  combination with rasayana (rejuvenating) plants could enable an individual to  lead a healthy life of 100 years.","According to 'Brain enhancing ingredients from Āyurvedic medicine: quintessential example of Bacopa monniera, a narrative review', Ayurvedic remedies for various diseases, including brain disorders and memory disorders, are based on natural and immune system enhancement.

What are some traditional Indian practices for diagnosing and treating diseases?,"BACKGROUND: Traditional medicine in India can be classified into codified  (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) and non-codified (folk medicine) systems.  Both the systems contributing equally to the primary healthcare in India. The  present study is aimed to understand the current scenario of medicinal practices  of non-codified system of traditional medicine in Belgaum region, India. METHODS: The study has been conducted as a basic survey of identified  non-codified traditional practitioners by convenience sampling with semi  structured, open ended interviews and discussions. The learning process, disease  diagnosis, treatment, remuneration, sharing of knowledge and socio-demographic  data was collected, analysed and discussed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty traditional practitioners were identified and  interviewed for the present study. These practitioners are locally known as  ""Vaidya"". The study revealed that the non-codified healthcare tradition is  practiced mainly by elderly persons in the age group of 61 years and above  (40%). 73% of the practitioners learnt the tradition from their forefathers, and  19% of practitioners developed their own practices through experimentation,  reading and learning. 20% of the practitioners follow distinctive ""Nadi  Pariksha"" (pulse examination) for disease diagnosis, while others follow bodily  symptoms and complaints. 29% of the traditional practitioners do not charge  anything, while 59% practitioners receive money as remuneration.Plant and animal  materials are used as sources of medicines, with a variety of preparation  methods. The preference ranking test revealed higher education and migration  from villages are the main reasons for decreasing interest amongst the younger  generation, while deforestation emerged as the main cause of medicinal plants  depletion. CONCLUSION: Patrilineal transfer of the knowledge to younger generation was  observed in Belgaum region. The observed resemblance in disease diagnosis, plant  collection and processing between non-codified traditional system of medicine  and Ayurveda require further methodical studies to establish the relationship  between the two on a more objective basis. However, the practice appears to be  at crossroads with threat of extinction, because of non-inheritance of the  knowledge and non-availability of medicinal plants. Hence conservation  strategies for both knowledge and resources at societal, scientific and  legislative levels are urgently required to preserve the traditional wisdom.","According to 'Non-codified traditional medicine practices from Belgaum Region in Southern India: present scenario', the non-codified traditional medicine system, locally known as ""Vaidya"", is primarily practiced by elderly individuals in the Belgaum region of India. Most practitioners have learned from their forefathers (73%), while others have developed their own practices (19%). Disease diagnosis is typically done through ""Nadi Pariksha"" (pulse examination) or by observing bodily symptoms and complaints. The medicines used in this practice are derived from plant and animal materials. However, the practice is facing a threat of extinction due to the lack of knowledge inheritance and the non-availability of medicinal plants. Therefore, conservation strategies are urgently required to preserve"
Can I take a self-assessment test to understand my Ayurvedic Dosha balance for better health management?,"INTRODUCTION: The Ayurvedic theory of Tri-Dosha offers a unique framework for  understanding human differences in health and disease. The Doshas could be  readily applied in clinical studies to control for such differences the same way  sex, age, height and weight are routinely used except that clinical evaluation  is required and methods vary. No open-source questionnaire has been shown to be  reliable for self-assessment. Therefore, we undertook this study to develop a  reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire with characteristics suitable for  use in clinical research. METHODS: A review of published questionnaires and translations of classic  Ayurvedic texts along with an analysis of item-total correlations and ANOVAs by  Dosha for 735 responses to a 37-item ipsative questionnaire from an Ayurveda  products company served as the basis for generating 108 Dosha-specific test  items featuring a 7-point Likert scale. We used item-total and inter-item  correlations from a convenience sample of 176 individuals to identify the best  performing items. We then solicited repeat responses to the resultant 39-item  questionnaire (13 for each Dosha) from these and other website visitors and  calculated test-retest reliability as the intraclass correlation coefficient for  absolute agreement (ICC 2,1) for each Dosha. RESULTS: The final questionnaire gives normally distributed results. Among 76  self-selected adults, the test-retest reliabilities for Vata, Pitta and Kapha  Dosha scores are all above 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is possible to quantify the three  Doshas with adequate reliability for most clinical studies.","According to 'Development of a reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire', a reliable Dosha self-assessment questionnaire has been developed that can be utilized in clinical research. The questionnaire includes 39 items, with 13 questions for each Dosha - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The test-retest reliabilities for these Dosha scores were found to be above 0.8 among 76 self-selected adults. The final questionnaire results were normally distributed. This implies that the three Doshas can be quantified with adequate reliability for most clinical studies."
What are some home-based Ayurveda remedies that can help manage the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy?,"Chemotherapy drugs and radiotherapy are highly toxic and both damage adjacent  healthy cells. Side effects may be acute (occurring within few weeks after  therapy), intermediate or late (occurring months or years after the therapy).  Some important side effects of chemotherapy are: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  mucositis, alopecia, constipation etc; whereas radiation therapy though  administered locally, can produce systemic side effects such as fatigue,  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, alteration in the taste, sleep disturbance,  headache, anemia, dry skin, constipation etc. Late complications of these  therapies also include pharyngitis, esophagitis, laryngitis, persistent  dysphagia, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, infertility and cognitive deficits. These  arrays of side effects have a devastating effect on the quality of life of  cancer survivors. Due to the inadequacy of most of the radio-protectors and  chemo-protectors in controlling the side effects of conventional cancer therapy  the complementary and alternative medicines have attracted the view of  researchers and medical practitioners more recently. This review aims at  providing a comprehensive management protocol of above mentioned  chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects based on Ayurveda, which is an ancient  system of traditional medicine practiced in Indian peninsula since 5000 BC. When  the major side effects of chemo-radiotherapy are looked through an ayurvedic  perspective, it appears that they are the manifestations of aggravated pitta  dosha, especially under the group of disorders called Raktapitta (haemorrhage)  or Raktadushti (vascular inflammation). Based on comprehensive review of ancient  vedic literature and modern scientific evidences, ayurveda based interventions  are put forth. This manuscript should help clinicians and people suffering from  cancer to combat serious chemo-radiotherapy related side effects through simple  but effective home-based ayurveda remedies. The remedies described are commonly  available and safe. These simple ayurveda based solutions may act as an  important adjuvant to chemo-radiotherapy and enhance the quality of life of  cancer patients.","According to ""Ayurveda for chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects in cancer patients"", the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which can significantly impact the quality of life of cancer patients, can potentially be managed through Ayurvedic remedies. Major side effects of these therapies are seen as manifestations of aggravated pitta dosha in Ayurveda, particularly under the group of disorders called Raktapitta (haemorrhage) or Raktadushti (vascular inflammation). The Ayurveda-based interventions for these side-effects are simple, safe, and can be done at home using commonly available items. These Ayurvedic remedies could serve as an important adjuvant to chemo-radiotherapy, potentially enhancing the quality of life for cancer"
Can Ayurveda help in improving my body's defense mechanism?,"In ayurvedic system of medicine, it is considered that a living system is made  of panch-mahabuta, in the form of Vata, pitta and kapha at the physical level  and satwa, raja and tama at the mental level. This covers the psychosomatic  constitution and commonly known as the Tridosh theory. The imbalance in these  body humours is the basic cause of any type of disease manifestation. Till date,  several objective parameters have been proposed to monitor the level of these  basic humours but none of them is complete. In this exercise, now it is proposed  to consider free radical theory of diseases as one of the objective parameters.  To be more specific, vata can be monitored in terms of membrane bound signal  transduction, pitta as the process of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of  different proteins (signalling moieties and enzymes) and kapha can be viewed as  the degree of gene expression as protein synthesis. This can be correlated with  the ojas of the body or total body defence mechanism.","According to 'Molecular approach to ayurveda', the Ayurvedic system of medicine believes that diseases are caused by an imbalance of body humours, known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha at the physical level, and Satwa, Raja, and Tama at the mental level. This is known as the Tridosh theory. The paper suggests that these can be monitored in the following ways: Vata through membrane-bound signal transduction, Pitta through the process of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of different proteins, and Kapha through the degree of gene expression as protein synthesis. These are proposed to be correlated with the ojas of the body or total body defence mechanism."
"Are traditional remedies, specifically Indian Ayurvedic remedies, safe to use considering the risk of heavy metal poisoning?","The popularity of traditional remedies has greatly increased in westernised  countries over recent years. Although many of these remedies are used safely,  there have recently been an increasing number of case reports being published of  heavy metal poisoning after the use of traditional remedies, in particular,  Indian Ayurvedic remedies. This study reviews the data on published cases, along  with the history of Ayurvedic medicine in an attempt to provide an insight into  why heavy metals, in particular lead, mercury and arsenic are added in such  large concentrations to these remedies.","According to ""A review of the clinical and toxicological aspects of 'traditional' (herbal) medicines adulterated with heavy metals"", the use of traditional Indian Ayurvedic remedies has been linked to an increasing number of case reports of heavy metal poisoning. These remedies are noted to contain large concentrations of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic."
"What are the health benefits of taking cyavanaprāsh, an Ayurvedic medicine?","The paper discusses the many forms and representations of cyavanaprāsh,  Ayurveda's best-selling medicine, already mentioned in Caraka's Compendium (c.  200 CE). The medicine's compositions, applications, and meanings, change over  time and from locality to locality. Cyavanaprāsh is, for example, a patriotic  formula, a booster of the immune system, a modern geriatric drug, and one of the  elements in canonical Ayurvedic treatments. In the beginning of the 19th century  cyavanaprāsh was a patriotic formula for fortifying Indian bodies and the  nascent Indian nation. Nowadays the medicine is a Fast Moving Consumer Good  (FMCG) and a money maker for Dabur India Ltd., the world largest Ayurvedic  manufacturer. Instead of vitalising the nation its consumption now promises to  make urban middle class consumers effectively modern. Branding and modern  science must make Dabur Chyawanprash attractive in the eyes of these consumers.  Ayurveda and cyavanaprāsh are also part of a global counter culture marked by  neo-Orientalism and Ayurvedic medicines as facilitators of spirituality. The  marketing of cyavanaprāsh by India's largest Ayurvedic manufacturer is used as a  case study for discussing the proliferation of Ayurvedic brands and its critics.  The imaging of Ayurvedic brands such as Dabur Chyawanprash threatens to obscure  the fact that Ayurveda represents a unique way of looking upon health, disease  and the human body. The proliferation of brands also makes Ayurvedic medicines  more expensive and puts pressure on the natural environment as the main supplier  of Ayurvedic ingredients.","According to ""Assembling cyavanaprāsh, Ayurveda's best-selling medicine,"" cyavanaprāsh is a highly popular Ayurvedic medicine with changing compositions, applications, and meanings over time and across different locations. Initially used as a patriotic formula for strengthening Indian bodies and the nation in the early 19th century, it is now primarily consumed as a Fast Moving Consumer Good, acting as an immune booster, a geriatric drug, and a part of canonical Ayurvedic treatments. Its consumption promises to make urban middle class consumers modern and effective. However, the marketing and branding, particularly by Dabur India Ltd., the world's largest Ayurvedic manufacturer, have been criticized for obscuring Ayurveda's unique health"
What precautions should I take when using Ayurvedic medicines for health issues?,"PURPOSE: We report a case of a 30 years old Indian sailor with microcytic anemia  (Hb 9.9), persistent abdominal pain, emesis, dark stool, hyperchromic urine,  latent jaundice and asthenia. Lead intoxication was confirmed (blood lead value  of 102 μg/dL). The patient assumed Ayurvedic medicines in the previous months.  Ayurveda is an ancient form of Indian traditional popular medicine aiming to  re-establish health and body function through herbal preparations, heavy metals  are often added. Our purpose was to treat the patient and to establish the  source of poisoning. METHODS: After testing blood and urine lead concentration of other 3 crew  members and analyzing over than 150 products used on the ship professional  exposure was excluded. We analyzed the two Ayurvedic drugs assumed by the  patient with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The patient  underwent three chelation cycles with Calcium Disodium  Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) while monitoring blood and urinary lead  levels. RESULTS: The final blood lead level at discharge, after three chelation cycles,  was 36.27 μg/dL. One of the two drugs contained extremely high concentrations of  lead and mercury. The three different mixtures of this preparation showed lead  concentrations of 12,638.54 mg/kg (Sample 2A), 23,043.02 mg/kg (Sample 2B),  21,352.97 mg/kg (Sample 2C); these levels are much higher than the highest  values reported in literature for the indian soil (32 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: This case and similar cases raise the safety alert on complementary  and alternative medicines; Ayurvedic medicine users should be carefully informed  about potential risks and signs of poisoning.","According to 'Lead poisoning from Ayurvedic treatment: a further case', the patient had been using Ayurvedic medicines which were found to contain extremely high concentrations of lead and mercury. The patient was treated for lead poisoning through three chelation cycles with Calcium Disodium Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which helped reduce his blood lead levels. The paper highlights the need for Ayurvedic medicine users to be informed about potential risks and signs of poisoning."
Is it safe to consume Ayurvedic medicines with high ethanol content?,"BACKGROUND: A large part of the population of India prefers the traditional  medicine (ayurvedic formulations) for primary health care. However, the  effective quality control of herbal medicine is still a big challenge. Numerous  reports indicate noncompliance with Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice  (GMP) guidelines by the manufacturers which may lead to adverse drug reactions  or toxic effects. Asava and arishta are the classical herbal dosage forms  wherein fermentation occurs during production leading to the generation of  ethanol. The presence of ethanol in these preparations may lead to their misuse.  The self-generated ethanol is responsible for extraction of active constituents  and acts as a self-preservative. As the procedure for preparation for asava and  arishta is same, the ethanol content is also expected to be the same  irrespective of the manufacturer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess and compare the  ethanol content of some traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations available  in the market. METHOD: In this study, 20 formulations from 3 different manufacturers available  as over-the-counter products were obtained and their ethanol contents were  determined using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were noted in the ethanol content  of various ayurvedic formulations. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and  validated gas chromatographic method for estimation of ethanol in fermented  ayurvedic formulations was also developed successfully in present study. CONCLUSION: The data generated during study reflected poor compliance of GMP  guidelines by the manufacturers and hence the quality is being grossly  compromised posing a safety hazard.","According to ""Ethanol content in traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations: Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice regulations - compromised health"", the traditional Ayurvedic remedies known as Asava and Arishta, which are produced through fermentation, contain ethanol. This ethanol is self-generated during the production process and serves to extract active constituents and preserve the remedies. However, the study found significant differences in the ethanol content of these remedies across different manufacturers, indicating noncompliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. This could pose a safety hazard due to the potential for misuse or adverse reactions."
What are some Ayurvedic herbs that could potentially help with epilepsy?,"Epilepsy, that comprises a wide spectrum of neuronal disorders and accounts for  about one percent of global disease burden affecting people of all age groups,  is recognised as apasmara in the traditional medicinal system of Indian  antiquity commonly known as Ayurveda. Towards exploring the molecular level  complex regulatory mechanisms of 63 anti-epileptic Ayurvedic herbs and  thoroughly examining the multi-targeting and synergistic potential of 349  drug-like phytochemicals (DPCs) found therein, in this study, we develop an  integrated computational framework comprising of network pharmacology and  molecular docking studies. Neuromodulatory prospects of anti-epileptic herbs are  probed and, as a special case study, DPCs that can regulate metabotropic  glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are inspected. A novel methodology to screen and  systematically analyse the DPCs having similar neuromodulatory potential  vis-à-vis DrugBank compounds (NeuMoDs) is developed and 11 NeuMoDs are reported.  A repertoire of 74 DPCs having poly-pharmacological similarity with  anti-epileptic DrugBank compounds and those under clinical trials is also  reported. Further, high-confidence PPI-network specific to epileptic  protein-targets is developed and the potential of DPCs to regulate its  functional modules is investigated. We believe that the presented schema can  open-up exhaustive explorations of indigenous herbs towards meticulous  identification of clinically relevant DPCs against various diseases and  disorders.","According to ""Insights about multi-targeting and synergistic neuromodulators in Ayurvedic herbs against epilepsy: integrated computational studies on drug-target and protein-protein interaction networks"", researchers have identified 63 anti-epileptic Ayurvedic herbs that contain 349 drug-like phytochemicals (DPCs) with the potential to treat epilepsy.

Is it safe to use Ayurvedic medicines and what are the risks of heavy metal poisoning from them?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, Indian traditional system of medicine, is practiced  commonly in South East Asia and in many parts of the world. Many ayurvedic drugs  contain heavy metals and may lead to metal toxicity. Of these, chronic lead  poisoning is the most common. Chronic arsenic poisoning following the use of  ayurvedic medication, though reported, is rare. CASE REPORTS: We describe three patients who presented with features of chronic  arsenic poisoning following prolonged ayurvedic medication use. The diagnosis of  chronic arsenic poisoning was confirmed by high arsenic levels in the blood,  urine, hair, and nails in all the three patients and in ayurvedic drug in two  patients. The ayurvedic medication was discontinued and treatment with  D-penicillamine started. At 6 months after treatment, blood arsenic levels  returned to normal with clinical recovery in all of them. CONCLUSION: Arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication is much less common  than lead poisoning, though mineral ayurvedic medicines may lead to it. We used  D-penicillamine as chelator and all of them recovered. Whether withdrawal of  medication alone or D-penicillamine also played a role in recovery is unclear  and needs to be assessed.","According to 'Chronic arsenic poisoning following ayurvedic medication', some Ayurvedic medications contain heavy metals that may lead to metal toxicity, including chronic lead poisoning and, in rare cases, chronic arsenic poisoning. This was confirmed through high arsenic levels in the blood, urine, hair, and nails of three patients who had been using Ayurvedic medication for a prolonged period. The treatment used to help these patients recover was to discontinue the Ayurvedic medication and start treatment with D-penicillamine, a chelator. The patients' blood arsenic levels returned to normal and they clinically recovered after six months of treatment. However, it is unclear whether the recovery was due to the withdrawal of the Ayurvedic medication,"
Is Ayurveda Bhasma safe to use for treating dyspepsia?,"Ayurveda Bhasma is a metallic-mineral preparation homogenised with herbal juices  or decoctions and modified with heat treatment to apparently detoxify the heavy  metals. It is widely recommended for the treatment of many disease conditions by  practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine in the absence of good  quality clinical trial evidence on its safety and efficacy. Heavy metal-induced  liver injury is widely reported in the literature, and heavy metal adulteration  of non-Bhasma-related Ayurveda and herbal products has been well described. We  report a patient who developed severe liver injury requiring listing for liver  transplantation for improved survival, after consumption of Bhasma for  dyspepsia. This case describes the first documented case and toxicology analysis  of Ayurveda Bhasma associated with severe drug-induced liver injury. Physicians  must be alert regarding patient's use of supposedly safe Ayurveda Bhasma that  may promote acute severe liver injury in the absence of other known aetiologies.","According to ""Ayurveda metallic-mineral 'Bhasma'-associated severe liver injury"", Ayurveda Bhasma is a metallic-mineral preparation used in alternative medicine for treating various ailments.

How can understanding my Prakriti type in Ayurveda help in choosing the right treatment for my health issues?,"In Ayurveda system of medicine individuals are classified into seven  constitution types, ""Prakriti"", for assessing disease susceptibility and drug  responsiveness. Prakriti evaluation involves clinical examination including  questions about physiological and behavioural traits. A need was felt to develop  models for accurately predicting Prakriti classes that have been shown to  exhibit molecular differences. The present study was carried out on data of  phenotypic attributes in 147 healthy individuals of three extreme Prakriti  types, from a genetically homogeneous population of Western India. Unsupervised  and supervised machine learning approaches were used to infer inherent structure  of the data, and for feature selection and building classification models for  Prakriti respectively. These models were validated in a North Indian population.  Unsupervised clustering led to emergence of three natural clusters corresponding  to three extreme Prakriti classes. The supervised modelling approaches could  classify individuals, with distinct Prakriti types, in the training and  validation sets. This study is the first to demonstrate that Prakriti types are  distinct verifiable clusters within a multidimensional space of multiple  interrelated phenotypic traits. It also provides a computational framework for  predicting Prakriti classes from phenotypic attributes. This approach may be  useful in precision medicine for stratification of endophenotypes in healthy and  diseased populations.","According to ""Recapitulation of Ayurveda constitution types by machine learning of phenotypic traits"", Ayurveda classifies individuals into seven constitution types, ""Prakriti"", to assess disease susceptibility and drug responsiveness.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for allergy symptoms like nasal congestion and sneezing?,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an immune response of the nasal mucosa to  airborne allergens and involves nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge,  itching of the nose, and sneezing. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may  significantly affect a patient's quality of life and can be associated with  conditions such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, and sleep  disturbances. Various complementary and alternative medicine treatments have  been used for this condition in clinical practice. The Ayurveda system of  medicine is the most common complementary medicine system practiced in Sri  Lanka. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of a  decoction used in traditional Ayurveda for allergic rhinitis and its ready-  to-use freeze dried formulation in comparison to an antihistamine over a period  of 4 weeks on relief of symptoms in allergic rhinitis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a three-arm, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized  controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with AR. Tamalakyadi decoction  containing 12 ingredients (TMD12), used in traditional Ayurveda and its  freeze-dried formulation are the test products. The efficacy and safety of the  two Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the antihistamine loratadine.  Patients with symptoms of AR will be allocated randomly into the three arms  after a 1-week run-in period and the medications will be given orally for  28 days. Total Nasal symptom Score (TNSS) of the patients will be used as the  primary efficacy endpoint. TNSS will be recorded and compared between the three  arms prior to visit 1, at the end of 28 days, and end of the first and second  months of follow-up. Symptom scores of daytime nasal symptoms, night time nasal  symptoms, non-nasal symptoms and health-related quality of life questionnaire  are used as secondary end points. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will be able to provide evidence-based  scientific data on Ayurvedic dosage form, TMD12, and the freeze-dried  formulation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

How does Ayurvedic medicine use the concept of dry and wet lands in managing health and wellness?,"In classical Ayurvedic medicine, the jungle is the dry land of the Punjab and  the Delhi Doab, an open vegetation of thorny shrubs. The polarity of dry lands  and wet lands framed not only the whole Ayurvedic materia medica, but also the  more general conception of a cosmic physiology governed by Agni (the sun) and  Soma (the dispenser of the rain). Clearing the land and draining the body were  two aspects of one and the same art of managing the transactions of all sorts of  vital fluids, saps, juices, savors and humors. Medicine in the context of  thought and practice associated with the jungle was, and still is in modern  India, a kind of agriculture.","According to 'The jungle and the aroma of meats: an ecological theme in Hindu medicine', the practice of Ayurvedic medicine involves managing the transactions of various vital fluids, saps, juices, savors and humors. This is likened to the agricultural process of clearing the land and draining the body.

What are some traditional Indian remedies for skin diseases?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional knowledge is a particular form of  practice or skill set that was developed in ancient times and was sustained  through generations via the passing of knowledge, essentially confined within a  specific tribe, local people, or family lineages. Ethnodermatological use of  medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if  there is chemical, microbiological, and/or clinical evidence, from a scientific  perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review  can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug  development. AIM OF THE STUDY: We compile and emphasize the most important part of  ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their  applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review  and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the  pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants  against problem skin diseases as well. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different kinds of key phrases such as ""Indian  traditional ethnodermatology"", ""ethnodermatology"", ""ethnobotany"", ""skin  diseases"", ""Ayurveda dermatology"", ""pharmacological activity"" were searched in  online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar  (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/),  PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository  (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained  from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary  shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants' uses have been found  across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities  of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against  particular skin diseases. RESULTS: The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian  subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin  disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is  topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the  pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice,  bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment  remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This  review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the  belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective  therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical  evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may  contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today,  ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new  practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will  further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of  natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand  for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on  plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be  intensified.","According to ""Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India: From ayurvedic formulations to clinical perspectives - A review"", traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their applications for skin diseases in India, also known as ethnodermatology, holds great potential for treating various skin disorders. The primary method of administration of these herbal remedies is topical, though a few are administered orally. Some of the most frequently cited plants have been tested for their pharmacological activity against mice, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. However, further research and clinical evidence is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these species in treating skin conditions, particularly atopic ecicema. The review advocates for increased research into plants utilized in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere"
Does the practice of Ayurveda and its classification of Prakriti have a genetic basis?,"The practice of Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, is based on the  concept of three major constitutional types (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) defined as  ""Prakriti"". To the best of our knowledge, no study has convincingly correlated  genomic variations with the classification of Prakriti. In the present study, we  performed genome-wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis (Affymetrix,  6.0) of 262 well-classified male individuals (after screening 3416 subjects)  belonging to three Prakritis. We found 52 SNPs (p ≤ 1 × 10(-5)) were  significantly different between Prakritis, without any confounding effect of  stratification, after 10(6) permutations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of  these SNPs classified 262 individuals into their respective groups (Vata, Pitta  and Kapha) irrespective of their ancestry, which represent its power in  categorization. We further validated our finding with 297 Indian population  samples with known ancestry. Subsequently, we found that PGM1 correlates with  phenotype of Pitta as described in the ancient text of Caraka Samhita,  suggesting that the phenotypic classification of India's traditional medicine  has a genetic basis; and its Prakriti-based practice in vogue for many centuries  resonates with personalized medicine.","According to the research paper ""Genome-wide analysis correlates Ayurveda Prakriti"", the traditional Ayurvedic concept of Prakriti, which classifies individuals into Vata, Pitta, and Kapha types, has a genetic basis. The study found 52 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differ between these Prakriti types. Furthermore, the study found that the PGM1 gene correlates with the Pitta phenotype as described in the ancient Ayurvedic text of Caraka Samhita. This suggests that Ayurvedic practice, which has been in use for centuries, aligns with the modern concept of personalized medicine."
How can health literacy be improved among older diabetics in India?,"Older Indian diabetics lack proper health literacy making them vulnerable to  complications. Assessment of health literacy was done by hospital-based  cross-sectional study. Face-to-face interview was conducted by pretested  structured questionnaires. Diabetes patients aged ≥60 years consisted of 56.22%  males and 43.78% females; in addition, 34.2% respondents were without formal  schooling. Diabetes was known to 63.56% respondents. Total knowledge and  practice score of the respondents was good (18.9% and 35.1%), average (30.7% and  46.9%), and poor (50.4% and 18%), respectively. Knowledge and practice score was  strongly associated ( P < .01) with religion, educational status, and diabetes  duration with positive relationship ( R2 = 0.247, P < .01) between knowledge and  practice score.

Can Ayurvedic Bhasmas be used as a safe alternative for modern medicine?,"In this paper, we present an overview of Ayurvedic Bhasmas as nanomedicine of  herbo-metallic and mineral origin with particular attention to their structural  aspects. We find, the Bhasmas as nanomedicines may offer a huge potential for  designing new drugs employing the concept of nanotechnology. Thus, the  standardization of fabrication process of these formulations is a crucial issue  to be addressed. The structure and effectiveness of the Bhasmas as drugs depend  largely on their processing history. Bhasmas are generally safe drugs for human  beings in spite of the presence of seemingly toxic elements and compounds as  indicated by recent studies using modern analytical techniques. Nevertheless,  more systematic nanomaterialistic investigations on Bhasmas are recommended for  gaining the complete and reliable composition-processing-structure-effectiveness  picture of these drugs.","According to ""Ayurvedic Bhasmas: overview on nanomaterialistic aspects, applications, and perspectives"", Bhasmas are Ayurvedic remedies of herbo-metallic and mineral origin with nanomedicine properties.

However, the standardization of the fabrication process for these formulations is essential. Further nanomaterialistic research on Bhasmas is recommended to comprehensively understand their composition, processing, structure, and effectiveness."
What are some natural ways to improve male fertility according to Ayurveda?,"Infertility is a universal health problem affecting 15% of couples, out of which  20-30% cases are due to male infertility. The leading causes of male infertility  include hormonal defects, physical reasons, sexual problems, hazardous  environment, stressful lifestyle, genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and  oxidative stress. Various physiological functions involve reactive oxygen  species (ROS) and nitrogen species at appropriate levels for proper smooth  functioning. ROS control critical reproductive processes such as capacitation,  acrosomal reaction, hyperactivation, egg penetration, and sperm head  decondensation. The excessive free radicals or imbalance between ROS and  endogenous antioxidant enzymes damages sperm membrane by inducing lipid  peroxidation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage that eventually  lead to male infertility. Numerous synthetic products are available in the  market to treat infertility problems, largely ending in side effects and  repressing symptoms. Ayurveda contains a particular group of Rasayana herbs,  called vajikarana, that deals with nourishment and stimulation of sexual  tissues, improves male reproductive vitality, and deals with oxidative stress  via antioxidant mechanism. The present study aims to describe oxidative stress  and the role of herbal drugs in treating male infertility.","According to ""Oxidative Stress and Male Infertility: Role of Herbal Drugs"", Ayurveda suggests the use of a specific group of Rasayana herbs, known as vajikarana, to treat male infertility. These herbs work by nourishing and stimulating sexual tissues, improving male reproductive vitality, and managing oxidative stress through an antioxidant mechanism."
Can the Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa monnieri help improve behavior and cognition in children and adolescents?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinicians utilise critical research to advance their knowledge when  prescribing standard and alternative therapies for developmental disorders.  Recent research has reported that the traditional Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa  monnieri may improve cognitive outcomes in adult populations; however, few  studies have investigated its benefits in younger cohorts. The aim of the  current review is to systematically assess and critically summarize clinical  trial outcomes and safety of Bacopa and its effects on the cognition and  behaviour in children and adolescents. METHOD: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google and CINAHL were searched up to  August 2015 for trials investigating Bacopa monnieri in child and adolescent  populations. There were no restrictions in study design. Cognitive and  behavioural outcomes were grouped into validated constructs and effect sizes  were calculated for all significant data to allow for direct comparisons. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria for this review. The results  demonstrated significant consistent improvements in the language behaviour  cognitive domain and in a number of the memory sub-domains. Significant  improvements were also seen in hyperactivity and attention-deficit domains.  Overall outcome data demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (mean d=0.42).  Safety and tolerability data was well reported for 80% of studies with only 2.3%  of all participants reporting mild side-effects. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the safe use of Bacopa monnieri in child and  adolescent populations for improving elements of cognition as well as behaviour  and attention-deficit domains.

Is it safe to take Ayurvedic medicines for a long time without supervision?,Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient and traditional system of health care. It is  safe but inadvert and unsupervised use can lead to serious health complications.  Lead is a common constituent of these medicines. Here authors describe two cases  of lead encephalopathy as a result of long-term ayurvedic medication intake.  First case was a 54-year-old female taking ayurvedic medications since long time  presented with acute confusional state and memory disturbances with abdominal  pain. MRI brain showed symmetric basal ganglia and cortical signal changes and  edema with significantly elevated lead levels in blood. She responded to  chelation therapy with oral penicillamine with complete clinical and  radiological resolution. Second case presented was a 45-year female taking  ayurvedic medications for hypertension presented with headaches and rapid  deterioration in sensorium leading to coma and death. MRI brain showed diffuse  cerebral edema with basal ganglia signal changes with elevated lead levels in  blood. These two cases highlight the need for increased awareness that some  Ayurvedic medicines may contain potentially harmful levels of lead and people  who use them are at risk of developing associated toxicity which can even be  fatal.,"According to ""Acute Lead Encephalopathy Secondary to Ayurvedic Medication Use: Two Cases with Review of Literature"", Ayurvedic medicine can potentially contain harmful levels of lead which can lead to serious health complications.

"How does our individual Ayurvedic prakriti affect the makeup of our gut, oral, and skin microbiomes?","Ayurveda is one of the ancient systems of medicine which is widely practised as  a personalized scientific approach towards the general wellness. Ayurvedic  prakriti is broadly defined as the phenotypes which are determined on the basis  of physical, psychological and physiological traits irrespective of their  social, ethnic, dietary and geographical stature. Prakriti is the constitution  of a person, which comprises vata, pitta, and kapha and is a key determinant of  how one individual is different from the other. Human microbiome is considered  the 'latest discovered' human organ and microbiome research reiterates the  fundamental principles of Ayurveda for creating a healthy gut environment by  maintaining the individual-specific microbiome. Hence, it is important to  understand the association of human microbiome with the Ayurvedic prakriti of an  individual. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of human microbiome from  the gut, oral and skin samples of healthy individuals (n=18) by 16S rRNA  gene-based metagenomics using standard QIIME pipeline. In the three different  prakriti samples differential abundance of Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio,  Parabacteroides, Slackia, and Succinivibrio was observed in the gut microbiome.  Analysis also revealed prakriti-specific presence of Mogibacterium,  Propionibacterium, Pyramidobacter, Rhodococcus in the kapha prakriti individuals  Planomicrobium, Hyphomicrobium, Novosphingobium in the pitta prakriti  individuals and Carnobacterium, Robiginitalea, Cetobacterium, Psychrobacter in  the vata prakriti individuals. Similarly, the oral and skin microbiome also  revealed presence of prakriti-specific differential abundance of diverse  bacterial genera. Prakriti-specific presence of bacterial taxa was recorded and  only 42% microbiome in the oral samples and 52% microbiome in the skin samples  were shared. Bacteria known for preventing gut inflammation by digesting the  resistant starch were abundant in the pitta prakriti individuals, who are more  prone to develop gut-inflammation-related disorders. In summary, human gut, oral  and skin microbiome showed presence or high abundance of few bacterial taxa  across three prakriti types, suggesting their specific physiological importance.","According to 'Understanding the association between the human gut, oral and skin microbiome and the Ayurvedic concept of prakriti', Ayurvedic prakriti, which comprises vata, pitta, and kapha, is linked with the individual's human microbiome.

What conditions are commonly treated with Ayurveda in Sri Lanka?,"Sri Lanka has had a pluralist health care system for centuries, in which Western  biomedicine coexists with the Ayurveda system. However, recent studies suggest a  declining trend in the use of the Ayurveda system. This study provides insights  into the reasons for the low utilization of the Ayurveda system at present. The  study findings reveal that low utilization of the Ayurveda system can be  attributed to several factors, including the quick effect of Western medicines,  the perception of being accustomed to Western medicines, a lack of competent  Ayurveda practitioners, the high cost and low quality of Ayurveda medicines, and  the rapidly changing lifestyles of villagers. However, for certain conditions  such as fractures, snakebite, and paralysis, the majority of the Sri Lankan  population still uses Ayurveda treatment. In conclusion, we suggest that health  authorities should take into account these changes for future health planning in  Sri Lanka.","According to ""Paradox in treatment seeking: an experience from rural Sri Lanka"", the Ayurveda system in Sri Lanka is currently less utilized due to factors such as the fast effect of Western medicines, a perceived familiarity with Western medicines, a lack of skilled Ayurveda practitioners, and the high cost and low quality of Ayurveda medicines.

How can I make sure the herbal supplements I'm buying contain the right medicinal plants?,"INTRODUCTION: Ayurveda takes advantage of the beneficial properties of medicinal  plants. High demands in combination with inadequate availability of botanicals  and a lack of knowledge with respect to their precise identification lead to  adulterations in herbal products. Identification becomes more difficult in  complex herbal formulations. Four different polyherbal formulations have been  analyzed for the present paper. The targeted plants have different  pharmacological properties for various ailments. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the rbcL gene based plant DNA mini-barcode to  identify target and non-target plants in polyherbal formulations by using  high-throughput next generation sequencing. METHODS: Degenerate primers of the selected mini-barcode region have been  identified from the literature. A blend of 30 authentic medicinal plant species  was used to examine the species resolution capacity of the mini-barcode. DNA was  isolated from herbal formulations, an amplicon library was prepared, and  sequencing was performed on an IonS5 system. Data were analyzed using various  bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Analysis of control pooled samples revealed the optimum resolving power  of the DNA mini-barcode. Data analysis of the commercial samples revealed that  only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed  contents. In two formulations, only 10 out of 21 and 11 out of 20 plants were  detected, respectively. Additionally, several non-listed plants were also  detected in these formulations. Two formulations contained >20% reads assigned  to non-target plants. Overall, 21.98% of the reads were assigned to non-target  plants. CONCLUSION: The present study clearly demonstrated the successful application  and potential of meta-barcoding in the quality control of complex herbal  matrices. The results strongly suggest that this approach can be used in  pharmacovigilance of processed herbal products.","According to ""DNA meta-barcoding using rbcL based mini-barcode revealed presence of unspecified plant species in Ayurvedic polyherbal formulations"", Ayurvedic polyherbal formulations were tested and analyzed using the rbcL gene-based plant DNA mini-barcode. This method was applied to identify target and non-target plants in these formulations through high-throughput next generation sequencing. The analysis revealed that only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed contents, while the others contained fewer listed plants and several non-listed ones. This study suggests that DNA meta-barcoding can be used in the quality control of complex herbal matrices and in pharmacovigilance of processed herbal products."
Can Ayurveda and Yoga be used as a supportive treatment for COVID-19 patients with other health issues like diabetes and hypertension?,"BACKGROUND: We report a high-risk case of a coronavirus disease 19  (COVID-19)-positive patient with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM),  hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease (CKD), treated  successfully using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga, along  with government-mandated compulsory modern western medicine (MWM) treatment.  Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment  of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita  and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions  and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities,  along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi,  India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before  seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN,  hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was  resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough,  body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based  on the patient's symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including  Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle  modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga  consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms  within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately [Formula:  see text] relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief  within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar [FBS] and  postprandial blood sugar [PPBS]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days,  and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in  symptoms, the patient's real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the  symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a  significant improvement in blood sugar levels (not under control with modern  medicine) was also achieved. Integrative therapy based on the classical texts of  Ayurveda and Yoga may offer a promising and scalable treatment option for  COVID-19 patients. A case series or a suitably designed randomized controlled  trial is needed to assess its efficacy.","According to 'The use of integrative therapy based on Yoga and Ayurveda in the treatment of a high-risk case of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with multiple comorbidities: a case report', a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease, was successfully treated for COVID-19 using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga.

What is Shilajit and how is it used in Ayurvedic medicine?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shilajit is a multi-component natural occurring  mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine which  originated in India. Its source can be traced to the mountainous regions, where  the hilly tribes first identified its beneficial use. Shilajit is aptly referred  to as 'rasayana'/'rasayanam' in Ayurveda and Siddha literature which means  rejuvenator because it prevents ailment and enhances the quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An attempt has been put forth to review shilajit  pertaining to its origin, synonyms, varieties, physical properties, chemical  constituents, therapeutic properties and important biological properties to  affirm its rasayana property. All relevant information on shilajit was collected  from classical texts including pharmacopoeias, formularies, etc. Moreover,  select doctoral thesis from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Gujarat  Ayurved University, Jamnagar were also scanned. Published papers on shilajit  were collected from important databases for biomedical sciences. Amongst, the  various biological properties of shilajit, antioxidant activity and  immuno-modulatory activity were focused as it is closely related to its rasayana  potential. RESULTS: This review finds that shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations  and twenty-four proprietary drugs for extraneous indications. Even-though, there  is a long history of use of shilajit in traditional Indian materia medica,  shilajit unfortunately lacks scientific evaluation and systematic documentation.  In vivo antioxidant activity of shilajit has been studied at an irrelevant dose  and without using a positive control. The immuno-modulatory activity does not  stand the test of critical assessment and currently may be considered as  unproven. CONCLUSION: Based on the earlier studies, the bioactivity of shilajit lacks  substantial evidence. Nevertheless, further studies are imperative to overcome  the lacuna in establishing the antioxidant property of shilajit and more  specific assays are needed to vouch shilajit as an immuno-modulator which may be  of use to establish its rasayana potential.","According to 'Review on shilajit used in traditional Indian medicine', Shilajit is a natural mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine, originating from India. Its source is traced to mountainous regions. It is referred to as 'rasayana'/'rasayanam', which means rejuvenator, as it is believed to prevent ailments and enhance quality of life. However, the paper highlights that further studies are required to validate its reported antioxidant and immuno-modulatory properties."
Can the Ayurvedic medicine Mucuna pruriens help slow down the progression of Parkinson's disease?,"Immune control is associated with nigrostriatal neuroprotection for Parkinson's  disease (PD); though its direct cause and effect relationships have not yet been  realized and modulating the immune system for therapeutic gain has been openly  discussed. While the pathobiology of PD remains in study, neuroinflammation is  thought to speed nigrostriatal degeneration. The neuroinflammatory cascade  associated with PD begins with aggregation of misfolded or post-translationally  modified α-synuclein (α-syn). Such aggregation results in neuronal cell death  and the presence of chronically activated glia (microglia and astroglia),  leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis  factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and enzymes such as  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2). These changes in the glial phenotype can affect the central nervous  system (CNS) microenvironment by producing a pro-inflammatory milieu that speeds  PD pathogenesis. Mucuna pruriens (Mp) is the most popular drug in Ayurveda, the  Indian system of medicine. Several reports have suggested that it possesses  analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-epileptic and anti-microbial  activities. Mp contain L-DOPA and ursolic acid which has an anti-inflammatory  property. There are very few literatures which show the immunomodulatory  activity of Mp in PD, several researchers have tried to work on the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in some other diseases. The results of several  studies show that Mp modulate the immune components like TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-λ,  IL-1β, iNOS and IL-2 in the CNS. It also modulates the activity of the  transcription factor NF-kB which plays an important role in the progression of  the PD. Thus, by altering these cytokines or transcription factors, Mp protects  or prevents the progression of PD. Thus in this review we try to explore the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in PD.","According to ""Immunomodulation of Parkinson's disease using Mucuna pruriens (Mp)"", Mucuna pruriens (Mp), a popular drug in Ayurveda, possesses properties that can modulate the immune system and provide neuroprotection for Parkinson's disease (PD). The components in Mp, such as L-DOPA and ursolic acid, have anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate immune components like TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-λ, IL-1β, iNOS, and IL-2 in the central nervous system (CNS). Additionally, Mp can also influence the activity of the transcription factor NF-kB, which plays a crucial role in the progression of PD"
Can Ashwagandha help improve memory and energy levels in older people?,"Withania somnifera (Ashawagandha) is very revered herb of the Indian Ayurvedic  system of medicine as a Rasayana (tonic).

How has the focus on services and wellness in Kerala's Ayurveda practices influenced the approach to health and healing?,"Ethnographic inquiry into Ayurvedic commodification in Kerala revealed the  prevalence of a distinct regional pharmaceutical market dominated by  physician-manufacturers, oriented towards supplying classical medicines to  Ayurvedic doctors. This stands in sharp contrast to mainstream Ayurveda that is  observed to have undergone biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization. This  paper argues that Kerala's classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market  constitutes an alternative modernity because it provided Kerala Ayurveda with a  different route to modernization impervious to the biomedical regime, as well as  endowing it with the institutional power to safeguard its regional identity.  Although physician-entrepreneurs are its key architects, it is sustained by  value regimes shaped by a unique regional medico-cultural milieu. Even when  industrially produced, classical medicines remain embedded within Ayurveda's  socio-technical network; unlike proprietary drugs sold as individual  product-identities through non-Ayurvedic channels, they travel together as a  pharmacopeia, distributed through exclusive doctor-mediated agencies. This  clinic-centric distribution format is best conceptualized as an open-source  business model as it made low-margin generics viable by packaging them with  therapies and services. Besides ensuring better access and affordability, it  provided resistance to pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property  concentration. By keeping the doctor in the loop, it prevented medicines from  degenerating into de-contextualized commodities; the service component of  Ayurveda therein preserved went on become the unique selling point in the  health-tourism market. The tourism-inspired proliferation of Brand Kerala  eventually triggered a paradigm shift in mainstream Ayurveda - shifting focus  from 'pharmaceuticals' to 'services' and from 'illness' to 'wellness'.  Furthermore, interacting with hybrid Ayurvedas in transnational markets, Kerala  Ayurveda co-produces new alterities countervailing the structurally dominant  biomedical paradigm.","According to ""Keeping the doctor in the loop: Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals in Kerala"", the Ayurvedic remedy landscape in Kerala is dominated by physician-manufacturers who supply classical medicines to Ayurvedic doctors. This differs from mainstream Ayurveda, which is subject to biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization. Kerala's classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market offers an alternative route to modernization, maintaining its regional identity and resisting pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property concentration.

What Ayurvedic treatments can be used for secondary infertility in women?,"OBJECTIVES: Secondary Infertility is a major concern worldwide, accounting for  about 40% of female infertility due to lifestyle factor. Secondary Infertility  is having a close proximity to a disorder Vandhyatwa explained in Ayurvedic  classics, due to a variety of causes. Several Ayurvedic interventions are  advised such as Panchakarma (∼purification therapy) for vitiated Doshas in  female reproductive organs, Snehapana (∼oral intake of medicated oil) followed  by Virechana (∼purgation) to produce quality ovum. Other internal medications  like Phalaghrita, Ashokarishta, Kanchanara guggulu etc. have a probable mode of  action with enhancing the perceptibility of endometrium for implantation.  Correlating fallopian tubes with the Artavavaha Srotas, its block is compared  with the Sanga Srotodushti (obstructive pathology occurring in channels)of this  Srotas. By virtue of the purification therapy and internal medication working  synergistically might remove the Srotodustht. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30 year old female with a history of eight years post  marital infertility was treated with Panchakarma along with Ayurvedic medicines  after being diagnosed as infertility due to tubal blockage for a period of  16 weeks.

What are the health benefits of the Shatavari plant in Ayurvedic medicine?,"Shatavari-a famous Ayurveda materia medica used mainly as a tonic for women-is  distributed in health food products all over the world. The Ayurvedic  Pharmacopoeia of India identifies the botanical origin of shatavari as the  tuberous root of Asparagus racemosus. We recently investigated by DNA analysis  the botanical origin of shatavari products on the Japanese market. The results  suggested that their botanical origin was Asparagus; however, species  identification was difficult. In this study, we analyzed steroidal saponins,  including those specific to this plant, in these products and confirmed their  origin as A. racemosus. Next, alkaloid analyses of an authentic A. racemosus  plant and these products were performed, because several papers have reported  the isolation of a pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine alkaloid, asparagamine A, from this  plant. Our results suggest that neither plant material nor products contained  asparagamine A. It has been pointed out that Stemona plants are sometimes  mistaken for shatavari, because their tuberous roots have a similar shape to  that of A. racemosus, and pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine alkaloids are thought to be  Stemona-specific. These data strongly suggest that A. racemosus does not contain  asparagamine A, and that previous isolation of asparagamine A from materials  claimed as originating from A. racemosus was likely caused by misidentification  of Stemona plants as A. racemosus.","According to ""Chemical analysis reveals the botanical origin of shatavari products and confirms the absence of alkaloid asparagamine A in Asparagus racemosus"", Shatavari, an Ayurvedic remedy primarily used as a women's tonic, has been identified as originating from the tuberous root of the Asparagus racemosus plant. This was confirmed through DNA analysis and steroidal saponin analysis. The study also found that neither the plant material nor products derived from it contain the alkaloid asparagamine A. It suggests that previous claims of asparagamine A presence may have been due to misidentification of Stemona plants as A. racemosus."

What is the difference between Ayurvedic and allopathic medicine in terms of pain management?,"In-depth interviews and participant observation was conducted with 14 Hindu  religious renunciates, 70 years or older. Despite having taken vows renouncing  concern for physical pain or comfort, respondents differed markedly in their  attitudes toward pain and their rationale for utilizing medical treatment. They  differed still further in their use of Ayurvedic and allopathic medicine, with  the most culturally conservative accepting only Ayurvedic medicine. Rejection of  allopathic medicine tended to be associated with a highly systematized religious  world-view. The results are discussed in terms of both the ideological conflict  between religious world-view and medical usage, and the need for sophisticated  distinction of religious world-view if research on the religious factor of  health care utilization is to prove fruitful.","According to ""Identity, ideology and medicine: health attitudes and behavior among Hindu religious renunciates"", the most culturally conservative Hindu religious renunciates accept only Ayurvedic medicine.

What are some alternative treatments for managing psoriasis?,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a genetically predisposed autoimmune disease mediated  by cytokines released by the activated immune cells. It manifests inflammatory,  scaly red or white silvery flaky skin which may be a fluid-filled lesion with  soreness and itchiness. The prevalence rate of psoriasis is increasing day by  day. Despite having such a high prevalence rate, the treatment of psoriasis is  still limited. Hence, there is a need to rethink the various treatment  strategies available in the allopathic as well as in the alternative systems of  medicine. METHODS: Various bibliographic databases of previously published peer-reviewed  research papers were explored and systematic data culminated in terms of various  treatment strategies used for the management of psoriasis. The prime focus is  given towards modern as well as alternative systems of medicine such as  phototherapy, a combination of phototherapy with pharmacotherapy such as  Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy to treat  psoriasis. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of 161 papers, including both research and  review articles, was carried out to make the article readily understandable. The  pathogenesis including inflammatory mediators and type of psoriasis is discussed  before the treatment strategies to understand the pathophysiology of the  disease. The uniqueness, procedure, advantages, and limitations of conventional,  advanced, and traditional systems of medicine to treat psoriasis are discussed  in detail. Emphasis has also been given towards marine sources such as fish oil,  marine sponges, and algae. CONCLUSION: Although there are many modern and alternative treatment strategies  available to treat psoriasis, none of them have been proven to provide complete  relief to patients. Moreover, they are associated with certain side effects. In  order to overcome them, novel drug delivery systems have been utilized and found  effective; however, their stability and safety become the major impediments  towards their successful positioning. Traditional and alternative treatment  strategies have found to be safe and effective but their use is localized to  certain areas. In a nutshell, to achieve successful treatment of psoriasis,  there is a need to focus on the development of stable and non-toxic novel drug  delivery systems or the promotion of traditional systems to treat psoriasis.","According to ""Treatment Strategies Against Psoriasis: Principle, Perspectives and Practices"", Ayurveda, Yoga, and naturopathy are among the alternative treatment strategies used for managing psoriasis.

Is it safe to use Ayurvedic herbs from commercial products for treating respiratory symptoms?,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased global use  of traditional medicines, including Ayurvedic herbal preparations. Due to their  growing demand, their processed nature, and the complexity of the global supply  chain, there is an increased risk of adulteration in these products. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the use of DNA barcoding  for species identification in herbal supplements on the US market associated  with the Ayurvedic treatment of respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A total of 54 commercial products containing Ayurvedic herbs were  tested with four DNA barcoding regions (i.e., rbcL, matK, ITS2, and mini-ITS2)  using two composite samples per product. Nine categories of herbs were targeted:  amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and  vacha. RESULTS: At least one species was identified in 64.8% of products and the  expected species was detected in 38.9% of products. Undeclared plant species,  including other Ayurvedic herbs, rice, and pepper, were detected in 19 products,  and fungal species were identified in 12 products. The presence of undeclared  plant species may be a result of intentional substitution or contamination  during harvest or processing, while fungal DNA was likely associated with the  plant material or the growing environment. The greatest sequencing success  (42.6-46.3%) was obtained with the matK and rbcL primers. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that a combination of genetic  loci should be used for DNA barcoding of herbal supplements. Due to the  limitations of DNA barcoding in identification of these products, future  research should incorporate chemical characterization techniques.","According to ""DNA barcoding of herbal supplements on the US commercial market associated with the purported treatment of COVID-19"", Ayurvedic remedies for respiratory symptoms that have seen increased use during the COVID-19 pandemic include herbal preparations with ingredients such as amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and vacha. However, the study also found that there is an increased risk of adulteration in these products, with undeclared plant species and fungal species being identified in some products.

How can Ayurveda treatment help with managing psychological stress related to physical illnesses?,"BACKGROUND: Good mental condition is a vital part of health. Physical  impairments would potentially have psychiatric manifestations during the course  of a disease that could cause patients to experience a wide range of  psychological conditions. This study was conducted to determine prevalence of  anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological morbidities among the patients  who received warded treatments at Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Teaching  Hospital, Sri Lanka. METHODS: A total of 148 patients admitted to the hospital were selected for the  study on a random systematic basis under four systemic groups (gastrointestinal,  integumentary, musculoskeletal, and nervous system) depending on the chief  complaint. The presence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms was assessed  by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 item version (DASS 21). The General  Linear Model (GLM) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Over 50% of the participants in all four patient groups belonged to age  group of 35 to 65 years, encompassing the fraction of population that actively  contribute to the workforce in the society. Stress, anxiety, and depression  values of patients belonging to different complications varied significantly, as  indicated by GLM (p < 0.05). Patients diagnosed with integumentary  system-related issues denoted the highest stress levels (27.7 ± 2.54), while the  mean stress values among the other systemic groups were not significantly  different among each other. The highest anxiety levels were indicated by  patients with nervous system-related issues (18.6 ± 1.51), while the lowest  anxiety levels were indicated by patients with integumentary disorders  (6.0 ± 2.73). The highest depression level was identified from patients  suffering from integumentary system-related disorders (31.7 ± 3.42), followed by  nervous system (23.2 ± 1.78), gastrointestinal (19.5 ± 3.77), and  musculoskeletal (16.8 ± 1.57) disorders. CONCLUSION: Overall, high distress levels were observed among the majority of  the patients. Furthermore, integumentary issues may lead to significant  psychological impacts. As most of the patients seek for Ayurveda treatments when  their diseased condition becomes chronic, it is vital to focus on a  biopsychosocial approach to patient assessment and patient care, in actual  practice.","According to ""Assessment of Anxiety, Depression, Stress, and Associated Psychological Morbidities among Patients Receiving Ayurvedic Treatment for Different Health Issues: First Study from Sri Lanka"", a significant number of patients undergoing Ayurvedic treatments experience high levels of distress, particularly those with integumentary system-related disorders.

How can I ensure the Ayurvedic medicinal plants I purchase are authentic and not adulterated?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that originated in  ancient India, and it is still in practice. Medicinal plants are the backbone of  Ayurveda, which heavily relies on the plant-derived therapeutics. While Ayurveda  is becoming more popular in several countries throughout the World, lack of  authenticated medicinal plant raw drugs is a growing concern. Our aim was to DNA  barcode the medicinal plants that are listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of  India (API) to create a reference DNA barcode library, and to use the same to  authenticate the raw drugs that are sold in markets. METHODS: We have DNA barcoded 347 medicinal plants using rbcL marker, and  curated rbcL DNA barcodes for 27 medicinal plants from public databases. These  sequences were used to create Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA  Barcode Library (API-RDBL). This library was used to authenticate 100 medicinal  plant raw drugs, which were in the form of powders (82) and seeds (18). RESULTS: Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India - Reference DNA Barcode Library  (API-RDBL) was created with high quality and authentic rbcL barcodes for 374 out  of the 395 medicinal plants that are included in the API. The rbcL DNA barcode  differentiated 319 species (85 %) with the pairwise divergence ranging between  0.2 and 29.9 %. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing success rate of rbcL marker  was 100 % even for the poorly preserved medicinal plant raw drugs that were  collected from local markets. DNA barcoding revealed that only 79 % raw drugs  were authentic, and the remaining 21 % samples were adulterated. Further,  adulteration was found to be much higher with powders (ca. 25 %) when compared  to seeds (ca. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the utility of DNA barcoding in  authenticating medicinal plant raw drugs, and found that approximately one fifth  of the market samples were adulterated. Powdered raw drugs, which are very  difficult to be identified by taxonomists as well as common people, seem to be  the easy target for adulteration. Developing a quality control protocol for  medicinal plant raw drugs by incorporating DNA barcoding as a component is  essential to ensure safety to the consumers.","According to ""Creation of reference DNA barcode library and authentication of medicinal plant raw drugs used in Ayurvedic medicine"", Ayurvedic medicine heavily relies on medicinal plants, but there is a growing concern about the authenticity of these plant raw drugs. To address this, the researchers created a reference DNA barcode library for medicinal plants listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API). Using the rbcL marker, they DNA barcoded 347 medicinal plants and curated rbcL DNA barcodes for 27 more from public databases. This library was then used to authenticate 100 medicinal plant raw drugs sold in markets. The study found that only 79% of these raw drugs were authentic, and 21% were adulterated,"
Can the roots of Argyreia speciosa be used to treat male reproductive or nervous system disorders in Ayurvedic medicine?,"BACKGROUND: The roots of Argyreia speciosa (Linn. F) Sweet (family:  Convolvulaceae) are used in Ayurveda to treat male reproductive and nervous  system disorders. OBJECTIVE: Isolation of scopoletin from the roots of Argyreia speciosa, and  development and validation of an analytical method using HPLC for the  quantification of scopoletin from the root powder of Argyreia speciosa. METHOD: Scopoletin was isolated from chloroform fraction prepared from  hydrolyzed methanolic extract and identified using spectral studies. A  reverse-phase HPLC-based analytical method was developed and optimized using the  Design of Experiment (DoE) approach to estimate scopoletin from the roots of  Argyreia speciosa. Scopoletin was separated and quantified using HPLC containing  the C18 column and a PDA detector. The optimized mobile phase was methanol:  water (pH∼3.2) [25: 75, %v/v]. RESULTS: The Box-Behnken design was used to optimize chromatographic parameters  and the extraction procedure. The validation studies showed a linear  relationship (r2=0.998) in the range of 1-40 µg/mL. The LOD and LOQ were found  to be 0.28 µg/mL and 0.84 µg/mL, respectively, and the recovery values were  found to be between 91.94 and 97.86%. The developed analytical method was found  to be robust as well. The amount of scopoletin was estimated to be  0.024 ± 0.0016%w/w from dried root powder. CONCLUSION: The recorded chromatogram and amount of scopoletin determined would  serve as one of the standardization parameters to access the quality of raw  material containing Argyreia speciosa. HIGHLIGHTS: Developed analytical method may be adopted as a part of the  standardization procedure for Argyreia speciosa in the quality control  laboratory.","According to 'Quantification of Scopoletin from the Roots of Argyreia Speciosa (Linn. F) Sweet Using HPLC Through the Concept of Design of Experiment', the roots of Argyreia speciosa are used in Ayurveda for treating male reproductive and nervous system disorders.

Can Ashwagandha help improve muscle function and repair?,"Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) is used in Indian traditional medicine,  Ayurveda, and is believed to have a variety of health-promoting effects. The  molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying these effects have not yet been  sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of Ashwagandha  extracts and their major withanolides (withaferin A and withanone) on muscle  cell differentiation using C2C12 myoblasts. We found that withaferin A and  withanone and Ashwagandha extracts possessing different ratios of these active  ingredients have different effects on the differentiation of C2C12. Withanone  and withanone-rich extracts caused stronger differentiation of myoblasts to  myotubes, deaggregation of heat- and metal-stress-induced aggregated proteins,  and activation of hypoxia and autophagy pathways.

What Ayurvedic treatments are available for managing asthma or heart disease?,"INTRODUCTION: A number of traditional systems of medicine exist in India of  which Ayurveda is the most popular. Despite being in use for more than 3000  years, few properly designed trials have scientifically examined the clinical  potential of Ayurvedic and other medications. METHODS: We reviewed the MEDLINE database to identify clinical trials conducted  using traditional Indian medicines. Single case reports were excluded. RESULTS: Ayurvedic preparations have been successfully used for the treatment of  bronchial asthma, ischaemic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia. Formulations  containing curcumin were reported to reduce inflammation and disability in  double-blind clinical trials on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A number of  products are reported to be useful in patients with acute viral hepatitis. A  multicentric study by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed that a  preparation from Pterocarpus marsupium was effective in reducing levels of blood  glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin in patients with non-insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus. In another multicentric trial, patients with fistula-in-ano  were randomised to surgery or application of medicated seton (Ksharsootra).  Surgical treatment led to a faster cure but recurrence rates were lower with  medicated seton. Administration of extract from Bacopa monnieri, to children  with mental retardation, was reported to significantly improve short-term and  long-term memory. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based studies on the efficacy and safety of traditional  Indian medicines are limited. The essential ingredient in most formulations is  not precisely defined. High quality studies are necessary to evaluate and  compare the value of traditional Indian drugs to modern medicine.","According to ""Traditional Indian systems of medicine"", Ayurvedic treatments have been successfully used for ailments such as bronchial asthma, ischaemic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia.

How can Ayurveda support cancer treatment and recovery?,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize Ayurvedic perspectives on the etiopathogenesis and  supportive treatments for a biomedical diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: Hour-long, digitally recorded interviews were conducted with 10  experienced Ayurvedic clinicians, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using  techniques of qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified. The Ayurvedic description of the  pathophysiology of cancer uses traditional concepts translated into a modern  context. Although the biomedical treatment of cancer is considered valuable,  from an Ayurvedic perspective it results in degeneration and depletion. In cases  where biomedical treatment of cancer is not feasible, an Ayurvedic approach  focusing on strengthening digestion, eliminating toxins, reducing tumor growth,  and improving tissue metabolism is useful. An Ayurvedic approach to cancer  supportive care focuses on restoring equilibrium, building strength, and  rejuvenation. CONCLUSION: Ayurvedic medicine offers a unique perspective on the biomedical  diagnosis of cancer that emphasizes restoring wholeness, uses natural remedies,  includes a focus on emotional health, and emphasizes prevention strategies.","According to ""Correlating traditional Ayurvedic and modern medical perspectives on cancer: results of a qualitative study"", Ayurvedic medicine provides supportive treatments for cancer by strengthening digestion, eliminating toxins, reducing tumor growth, and improving tissue metabolism.

Can Ayurvedic medicine be effective in treating symptoms of schizophrenia?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems  since 1000 BC. OBJECTIVES: To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for  schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register  (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified  studies and contacted the first author of each included study. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all clinical randomised trials comparing  Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic  drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently extracted data and calculated  random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where  appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat  basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were  unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as  global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic  herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early  (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly  equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic  assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to  12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating  1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga  group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared  with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study  early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people  allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared  to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea  and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09  to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a  complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill  people with schizophrenia, it is equally ( 10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13  to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment  of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials.","According to 'Ayurvedic medicine for schizophrenia', Ayurvedic remedies have been used to treat schizophrenia, but their efficacy is not clearly demonstrated. In some studies, Ayurvedic herbs like brahmyadiyoga showed potential improvement in mental state ratings when assessed using Ayurvedic assessment, yet this improvement was not clearly seen when compared to antipsychotic drugs like chlorpromazine. Furthermore, use of Ayurvedic treatments like brahmyadiyoga was associated with side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Overall, while Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for the treatment of schizophrenia, it has only been evaluated in a few small pioneering trials and more research is needed."

Can knowing my prakriti type in Ayurveda help to personalize my treatment or predict susceptibility to certain diseases?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine describes a  unique concept ""prakriti"", genetically determined, categorising the population  into several subgroups based on phenotypic characters like appearance,  temperament and habits. The concept is claimed to be useful in predicting an  individual's susceptibility to a particular disease, prognosis of that illness  and selection of therapy. The present study was carried out to study if the  platelet aggregatory response and its inhibition by aspirin varied in the  different prakriti subtypes. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee permission, normal  healthy individuals of either sex between the age group 18 to 30 years were  recruited in the study. Their prakriti evaluation was done using a standardized  validated questionnaire (TNMC Prakriti 2004). Their Platelet Rich Plasma was  incubated with either aspirin [2.5 micro-mole (μM) and 5 μM] or distilled water  as control for three minutes after which the aggregatory response to 5 μM  Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) was measured over a period of 7 minutes. RESULTS: We observed that in the study population of normal healthy participants  (n= 137), ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) was highest among the  Vata-pitta prakriti individuals [Median (range), 83.33% (52.33-96)] as compared  to the other prakriti types and these individuals responded better to lower dose  of aspirin compared to other prakriti types. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that identifying the prakriti may help in  individualising therapy or predicting proneness to a disease.","According to 'Prakriti (Ayurvedic concept of constitution) and variations in platelet aggregation', the Ayurvedic concept of 'prakriti' could potentially assist in individualising therapy or predicting susceptibility to a disease. Specifically, in the study, it was found that individuals identified as having a Vata-pitta prakriti showed the highest levels of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)-induced maximal platelet aggregation (MPA). These individuals also responded better to lower doses of aspirin compared to other prakriti types."

Are herbal liver treatments safe in terms of residual solvents?,"Background Herbal medicines have been used in the treatment of liver diseases  for a long time. In recent years, the use of herbal medicines for protection  from other strong antibiotics as well as drugs that can damage the liver during  their metabolism in liver and for treatment of liver diseases has increased all  over the world. It is important to mention that a number of organic solvents are  used at different stages of extraction/formulation development for these  traditional preparations in industries/pharmacies. In addition, some of these  solvents possess established carcinogenic properties and may enter the  formulation as residual solvents. Hence as per ICH guidelines it is mandatory to  keep the level of these solvents up to permissible limits. There has been a lot  of hue and cry that ayurvedic formulations available in the market are not  properly standardized for their quality due to lack of stringent regulations and  standards from regulatory authorities. Therefore the aim of present work was to  assess the compliance of ICH guidelines for level of organic volatile impurities  in common marketed ayurvedic hepatic formulations. Methods In this study, 25  ayurvedic herbal formulations available as OTC product have been assessed for  presence of residual solvents using gas chromatography with flame ionization  detector. Results This study on 25 fast moving hepatic formulations in the  market reflects that no residual solvents were detected in any of the  formulations however if present were within prescribed permissible limits of ICH  guidelines. The data was also subjected to statistical analysis (F-test and  t-test at 95% confidence level). Conclusions Results indicate the safety of  these hepatic formulations with respect to residual solvents. In addition  presents a simple, linear, specific, accurate, precise and rugged gas  chromatographic method for estimation of residual solvents.","According to ""Assessment of compliance level of ICH guidelines for organic volatile impurities in common ayurvedic hepatic formulations"", the study assessed 25 over-the-counter Ayurvedic herbal liver disease formulations for the presence of residual solvents, which can have carcinogenic properties.

This indicated the safety of these Ayurvedic liver disease formulations with respect to residual solvents."
"What are some ways to manage skin conditions like psoriasis, vitiligo, and urticaria through practices like meditation and exercise?","Psychodermatology, a relatively neglected branch of dermatology in India, refers  to a holistic approach to skin diseases involving not only the mind and skin,  but also the cutaneous effects of psychologic stress. Among many Indian people,  culture, religion, the belief in karma, and the tendency to prefer indigenous  medical systems can all have a major impact on lifestyle, as well as the  approach to managing various diseases, including dermatologic conditions. The  origin of psychodermatology in India can be traced to Buddha's period.  Indigenous medical systems, such as Ayurveda, Yoga, and Unani, advocate control  of skin disease through meditation, exercises, and related practices. Scientific  practice of psychodermatology is still lacking in India, although there is an  increasing understanding of the mind-skin connection among both health care  providers and patients who have access to information over the Internet. The  first dedicated psychodermatology liaison clinic was established in 2010 in  Manipal, India. The common problems encountered have been anxiety, dysthymia,  and depression, especially in patients with psoriasis, vitiligo, and urticaria.","According to ""Psychodermatology: An Indian perspective,"" Ayurveda, Yoga, and Unani are indigenous medical systems in India that advocate for the control of skin diseases through practices like meditation and exercises.

What are some benefits of regularly consuming Chyawanprash for my overall health and immunity?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chyawanprash (CP), a traditional immune booster  recipe, has a long history of ethnic origin, development, household preparation  and usage. There are even mythological stories about the origin of this recipe  including its nomenclature. In the last six decades, CP, because of  entrepreneurial actions of some research Vaidyas (traditional doctors) has grown  to industrial production and marketing in packed forms to a large number of  consumers/patients like any food or health care product. Currently, CP has  acquired a large accepted user base in India and in a few countries out-side  India. AIM OF THE STUDY: Authoritative texts, recognized by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act  of India, describe CP as an immunity enhancer and strength giver meant for  improving lung functions in diseases with compromised immunity. This review  focuses on published clinical efficacy and safety studies of CP for correlation  with health benefits as documented in the authoritative texts, and also briefs  on its recipes and processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authoritative texts were searched for recipes, processes,  and other technical details of CP. Labels of marketing CP products (Indian) were  studied for the health claims. Electronic search for studies of CP on efficacy  and safety data were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE and DHARA (Digital Helpline for  Ayurveda Research Articles), and Ayurvedic books were also searched for clinical  studies. RESULTS: The documented clinical studies from electronic databases and Ayurvedic  books evidenced that individuals who consume CP regularly for a definite period  of time showed improvement in overall health status and immunity. However, most  of the clinical studies in this review are of smaller sample size and short  duration. Further, limitation to access and review significant data on  traditional products like CP in electronic databases was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials of high quality with larger sample  size and longer follow-up are needed to have significant evidence on the  clinical use of CP as immunity booster. Additional studies involving measurement  of current biomarkers of immunity pre- and post-consumption of the product as  well as benefits accruing with the use of CP as an adjuvant are suggested.","According to 'Chyawanprash: A review of therapeutic benefits as in authoritative texts and documented clinical literature', Chyawanprash (CP) is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy that is known to enhance immunity and improve lung functions, especially in diseases with compromised immunity. Regular consumption of CP over a specific period can improve overall health status and immunity. However, it is suggested that more high-quality randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to provide significant evidence on the clinical use of CP as an immunity booster."
What are some of the main herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine and what are their benefits?,"Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word, which means ""the scripture for longevity"". It  represents an ancient system of traditional medicine prevalent in India and in  several other south Asian countries. It is based on a holistic view of treatment  which is believed to cure human diseases through establishment of equilibrium in  the different elements of human life, the body, the mind, the intellect and the  soul [1]. Ayurveda dates back to the period of the Indus Valley civilization  (about 3000 B.C) and has been passed on through generations of oral tradition,  like the other four sacred texts (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and  Atharvanaveda) which were composed between 12(th) and 7(th) century B.C [2, 3].  References to the herbal medicines of Ayurveda are found in all of the other  four Vedas, suggesting that Ayurveda predates the other Vedas by at least  several centuries. It was already in full practice at the time of Buddha (6(th)  century B.C) and had produced two of the greatest physicians of ancient India,  Charaka and Shushrutha who composed the basic texts of their trade, the  Samhitas. By this time, ayurveda had already developed eight different  subspecialties of medical treatment, named Ashtanga, which included surgery,  internal medicine, ENT, pediatrics, toxicology, health and longevity, and  spiritual healing [4]. Ayurvedic medicine was mainly composed of herbal  preparations which were occasionally combined with different levels of other  compounds, as supplements [5]. In the Ayurvedic system, the herbs used for  medicinal purposes are classed as brain tonics or rejuvenators. Among the plants  most often used in Ayurveda are, in the descending order of importance: (a)  Ashwagandha, (b) Brahmi, (c) Jatamansi, (d) Jyotishmati, (e) Mandukparni, (f)  Shankhapushpi, and (g) Vacha. The general appearance of these seven plants is  shown in Fig.1. Their corresponding Latin names, as employed in current  scientific literature, the botanical families that each of them belongs to,  their normal habitats in different areas of the world, as well as the common  synonyms by which they are known, are shown in the Table 1. The scientific  investigations concerning the best known and most scientifically investigated of  these herbs, Ashwagandha will be discussed in detail in this review. Ashwagandha  (Withania somnifera, WS), also commonly known, in different parts of the world,  as Indian ginseng, Winter cherry, Ajagandha, Kanaje Hindi and Samm Al Ferakh, is  a plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is also known in different  linguistic areas in India by its local vernacular names [6]. It grows  prolifically in dry regions of South Asia, Central Asia and Africa, particularly  in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, South Africa, Egypt,  Morocco, Congo and Jordon [7]. In India, it is cultivated, on a commercial  scale, in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and  Rajasthan [6]. In Sanskrit, ashwagandha, the Indian name for WS, means ""odor of  the horse"", probably originating from the odor of its root which resembles that  of a sweaty horse. The name""somnifera"" in Latin means ""sleep-inducer"" which  probably refers to its extensive use as a remedy against stress from a variety  of daily chores. Some herbalists refer to ashwagandha as Indian ginseng, since  it is used in India, in a way similar to how ginseng is used in traditional  Chinese medicine to treat a large variety of human diseases [8]. Ashwagandha is  a shrub whose various parts (berries, leaves and roots) have been used by  Ayurvedic practitioners as folk remedies, or as aphrodisiacs and diuretics. The  fresh roots are sometimes boiled in milk, in order to leach out undesirable  constituents. The berries are sometimes used as a substitute to coagulate milk  in cheese making. In Ayurveda, the herbal preparation is referred to as a  ""rasayana"", an elixir that works, in a nonspecific, global fashion, to increase  human health and longevity. It is also considered an adaptogen, a nontoxic  medication that normalizes physiological functions, disturbed by chronic stress,  through correction of imbalances in the neuroendocrine and immune systems [9,  10]. The scientific research that has been carried out on Ashwagandha and other  ayurvedic herbal medicines may be classified into three major categories, taking  into consideration the endogenous or exogenous phenomena that are known to cause  physiological disequilibrium leading to the pathological state; (A)  pharmacological and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or  multi-herbal mixtures on specific non-neurological diseases; (B) pharmacological  and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or multi-herbal mixtures  on neurodegenerative disorders; and (C) biochemical, physiological and genetic  studies on the herbal plants themselves, in order to distinguish between those  originating from different habitats, or to improve the known medicinal quality  of the indigenous plant. Some of the major points on its use in the treatment of  neurodegenerative disorders are described below.","According to 'Scientific basis for the use of Indian ayurvedic medicinal plants in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders: ashwagandha', Ayurveda is an ancient system of traditional medicine that seeks to establish equilibrium in the body, mind, intellect, and soul to cure diseases. The most commonly used plants in Ayurveda, listed in descending order of importance, are Ashwagandha, Brahmi, Jatamansi, Jyotishmati, Mandukparni, Shankhapushpi, and Vacha. These herbs are used as brain tonics or rejuvenators. The plant Ashwagandha, also known as Withania somnifera or Indian ginseng, is"

How can I ensure that the Ashwagandha powder I'm buying is authentic and not adulterated?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng, is a  highly traded medicinal plant, which is used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani  systems of medicine to improve cognitive function, decrease inflammation, and to  counter the ill-effects of aging. Withanolide A and Withaferin A from  Ashwagandha were shown to improve immunity and have anti-cancer property,  respectively. AIM OF THE STUDY: Here, we aimed to create reference DNA barcodes for  W. somnifera and to authenticate root and powder samples of Ashwagandha  collected from markets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three plant specimen of W. somnifera were collected, and  reference DNA barcodes were generated using rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2 DNA  barcode markers. Market samples in the form of root (n = 33) and powder (n = 70)  were collected and authenticated using ITS2 and trnH-psbA DNA barcodes. RESULTS: Genomic DNA was successfully isolated from all plant specimens and  market samples. DNA barcoding showed that 77% of samples were authentic. About  22% of non-authentic samples were powder samples and only 1% were root samples.  Among the non-authentic samples, 18% were completely substituted with single  species (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., or Senna  auriculata (L.) Roxb.) and 82% were mixed samples containing more than one  species. About 63% of the mixed samples contained Ashwagandha as the major  ingredient. Furthermore, we identified that six taxonomically divergent plant  species from four families were present as adulterants in the mixed samples. CONCLUSION: DNA barcoding revealed that botanical adulteration in the market  samples of Ashwagandha is significant. Powder samples are more prone to  adulteration than root samples. The adulterated samples contained plant material  that is not related to Ashwagandha, which warrants strict quantity control and  market surveillance to derive the true medicinal benefits of this medicinal  plant.","According to ""Authentication of the market samples of Ashwagandha by DNA barcoding reveals that powders are significantly more adulterated than roots"", Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng, is a medicinal plant used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicine to improve cognitive function, decrease inflammation, and counteract the effects of aging. This study identified Withanolide A and Withaferin A from Ashwagandha as compounds that improve immunity and have anti-cancer properties, respectively. However, the study also found that market samples of Ashwagandha, particularly in powder form, often contained significant botanical adulteration, including the presence of unrelated plant material.

What is Agnibala in Ayurveda and how does it affect our health?,"According to Ayurveda, the traditional system of healthcare of Indian origin,  Agni is the factor responsible for digestion and metabolism. Four functional  states (Agnibala) of Agni have been recognized: regular, irregular, intense, and  weak. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a  self-assessment tool to estimate Agnibala The developed tool was evaluated for  its reliability and validity by administering it to 300 healthy volunteers of  either gender belonging to 18 to 40-year age group. Besides confirming the  statistical validity and reliability, the practical utility of the newly  developed tool was also evaluated by recording serum lipid parameters of all the  volunteers. The results show that the lipid parameters vary significantly  according to the status of Agni The tool, therefore, may be used to screen  normal population to look for possible susceptibility to certain health  conditions.","According to 'Development, Validation, and Verification of a Self-Assessment Tool to Estimate Agnibala (Digestive Strength)', the tool developed in this study can be used to estimate the state of Agni, or digestive strength, in relation to Ayurvedic principles. The tool was confirmed to be both statistically valid and reliable after being tested on 300 healthy volunteers. It was also found that variations in lipid parameters corresponded with the status of Agni, suggesting that the tool could be used to identify potential susceptibility to certain health conditions in the general population."

What are some health benefits of the Asparagus racemosus plant in traditional medicine?,"Asparagus racemosus Willd. (Asparagaceae) is an important medicinal plant of  tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the  Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as  Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Asparagus racemosus is mainly known for its  phytoestrogenic properties. With an increasing realization that hormone  replacement therapy with synthetic oestrogens is neither as safe nor as  effective as previously envisaged, the interest in plant-derived oestrogens has  increased tremendously making Asparagus racemosus particularly important. The  plant has been shown to aid in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and  in alcohol abstinence-induced withdrawal symptoms. In Ayurveda, Asparagus  racemosus has been described as a rasayana herb and has been used extensively as  an adaptogen to increase the non-specific resistance of organisms against a  variety of stresses. Besides use in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery,  the plant also has potent antioxidant, immunostimulant, anti-dyspepsia and  antitussive effects. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus  racemosus is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and  inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction in the  form of deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered  'endangered' in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of  this plant is crucial. This article aims to evaluate the biological activities,  pharmacological applications and clinical studies of Asparagus racemosus in an  attempt to provide a direction for further research. Keeping in mind the fact  that it is the active principle that imparts medicinal value to a plant;  consistency in quality and quantity needs to be maintained to ensure uniform  drug efficacy. Also, deliberate or inadvertent adulteration needs to be dealt  with at an early stage. To overcome these prevalent problems, the availability  of genetically superior and uniform planting material is essential. This can be  obtained by a combination of various biotechnological tools involving  chemoprofiling, tissue culture and use of molecular markers. Along with the  application of these methods, proper agro-techniques and adequate marketing  opportunities would encourage cultivation of Asparagus racemosus and thereby  contribute to its conservation. There are also several gaps in the existing  literature with regard to the pharmacological actions of Asparagus racemosus.  These include an incomplete understanding about the interaction/synergy between  Asparagus racemosus and other plant constituents in polyherbal formulations;  lack of information regarding the mode of action of the various constituents of  Asparagus racemosus, etc. Consequently, we have suggested a 'systems biology'  approach that includes metabolite profiling, metabolic fingerprinting,  metabolite target analysis and metabonomics to enable further research.","According to ""Asparagus racemosus--ethnopharmacological evaluation and conservation needs"", Asparagus racemosus is a medicinal plant used in Ayurveda, known for its phytoestrogenic properties.

Can my Ayurvedic body type (Prakriti) indicate my risk for certain health disorders?,"BACKGROUND: Body composition and types are often considered essential health  indicators for lifestyle-related disease. Assessment of body type based on  tridosha is regarded as a prerequisite in Ayurveda. AIM: To correlate body compositions and somatotypes with Prakriti body types. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 463 adult individuals was done.  Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured. Heath-Carter  somatotypes and Prakriti body types were also determined. Tests of association  were calculated. Correlation and concordance analysis was also done to infer the  correlation between body composition parameters and Prakriti body types. RESULTS: Kapha Prakriti have significantly higher body weight, body mass index  (BMI), body fat percentage and body fat mass. Vata have the lowest mean values  in all body composition parameters with Pitta in the intermediate position  compared to the other Prakriti types. There is a strong and positive statistical  association between Prakriti body types and body composition parameters, except  height. Cohen's Kappa analysis reveals there is a fair concordance between  Prakriti body types and somatotype. CONCLUSIONS: Prakriti assessment can explain an individual's fatness as it  correlates with body composition parameters and could be used to predict risk  susceptibility to various complex disorders.","According to ""Correlation of body composition parameters and anthropometric somatotypes with Prakriti body types among the Meitei adults of Manipur, India"", Prakriti assessment in Ayurveda can help understand an individual's body composition. The study found that individuals with Kapha Prakriti usually have higher body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage and body fat mass. On the other hand, individuals with Vata Prakriti have the lowest mean values in all body composition parameters. Pitta Prakriti individuals fall in an intermediate position. This correlation between Prakriti body types and body composition parameters can be used to predict an individual's susceptibility to various complex disorders."

Are there any safety concerns with using traditional Asian herbal preparations?,"Traditional herbal preparations used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine,  traditional Tibetan medicine, and other Asian traditional medicine systems may  contain significant amounts of mercury, arsenic or lead. Though deliberately  incorporated in Asian traditional herbal preparations for therapeutic purposes,  these constituents have caused intoxications worldwide. The aim of this study  was therefore to determine mercury, arsenic, and lead levels in Asian  traditional herbal preparations on the Dutch market. A total of 292 traditional  herbal preparations used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and  traditional Tibetan medicine were sampled between 2004 and 2007. Samples were  mostly multi-ingredient traditional herbal preparations containing herbs and  minerals. The labeling of less than 20% of the traditional herbal preparations  suggested the presence of mercury, arsenic or lead. These elements were shown by  inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in 186 (64%) of 292 traditional  herbal preparations. Estimated weekly mercury, arsenic, and lead intake levels  were calculated for each traditional herbal preparation from the analytically  determined concentrations and the recommended dose. A total of 59 traditional  herbal preparations (20%) were likely to result in intakes of these elements  significantly exceeding safety limits. Of these 59 traditional herbal  preparations, intake estimates for 50 traditional herbal preparations  significantly exceeded the safety limit for mercury (range = 1.4-1747 mg  week(-1)); intake estimates for 26 traditional herbal preparations significantly  exceeded the safety limit for arsenic (range = 0.53-427 mg week(-1)) and intake  estimates for eight traditional herbal preparations were significantly above the  safety limit for lead (range = 2.6-192 mg week(-1)). It is concluded that the  mercury, arsenic, and lead contents of traditional herbal preparations used in  Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Tibetan medicine remain  a cause for concern and require strict control.","According to 'Monitoring of mercury, arsenic, and lead in traditional Asian herbal preparations on the Dutch market and estimation of associated risks', traditional Asian herbal preparations, including those used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Tibetan medicine, may contain significant amounts of mercury, arsenic, or lead.

Can Ayurvedic formulations like Chandraprabha Vati and Maha Yogaraja Guggulu help in reducing free radicals in the body?,"Two polyherbal formulations of Ayurveda viz., Chandraprabha Vati and Maha  yogaraja Guggulu were evaluated for their free radical scavenging properties.  Methanolic extracts of the formulations were studied in four different in vitro  and ex vivo models. Total phenolic content of Chandraprabha Vati and Maha  yogaraja Guggulu was found to be 5.24% and 10.74% respectively. Methanolic  extracts of the formulations were good scavengers of all the radicals but there  was a difference in the activity of the two formulations in different models.  Chandraprabha Vati was a good scavenger of superoxide radical and Maha yogaraja  Guggulu was efficient in scavenging nitric oxide (NO), while both inhibited  lipid peroxidation efficiently. Free radical scavenging activity of the  different extracts can be attributed to the presence of various chemical  components including phenolics.","According to 'Evaluation of free radical scavenging properties of two classical polyherbal formulations', the Ayurvedic remedies Chandraprabha Vati and Maha yogaraja Guggulu have significant free radical scavenging properties. Chandraprabha Vati is particularly effective in scavenging superoxide radicals, while Maha yogaraja Guggulu is efficient in scavenging nitric oxide. Both formulations also effectively inhibit lipid peroxidation. These properties are likely due to the presence of various chemical components in the remedies, including phenolics."
How can the concept of Kriyakala in Ayurveda be used to detect or diagnose cancer in its early stages?,"The term Kriyakala refers to the recognition of the stage of a disease's  progress, which helps to determine appropriate measure to correct the imbalance  in Doshas (biological factors). It is a compound expression, comprised of Kriya  and Kala, where Kriya means the choice to treatment (medicine, food and  daily-routine) used to improve the disturbance in Doshas, and Kala refers to the  stage of progress of a disease. Sushruta, an ancient Indian surgeon, has  described the concept of Kriyakala in Varnaprashnadhyaya, an ancient Vedic  Sanskrit text, which seeks to explain the incidence of Varnas in terms of Doshic  disturbances. Varna, in modern parlance, may be described as an inflammatory  process that may lead ulceration and chronic inflammation, promoting all stages  of carcinogenesis. Abnormal interactions between Prakriti (genotype) and  environmental factors vitiate the Doshas and impair immunity, which can lead to  aberrant cell growth and cancer. Moreover, the interaction between vitiated  Doshas and weak Dhatus (body tissues) manifests as cancers of a specific organ.  Shatkriyakala (six stages of progress of a disease), on the other hand, provides  a framework to assess the cancer and its pathogenesis in different stages.  According to Ayurvedic concepts, all cancer therapies treat the affected tissues  indirectly by eliminating vitiated Doshas, rejuvenating Dhatus and restoring  immunity in cancer patients. The present review describes the six stages of  Shatkriyakala in detail, with an emphasis on research areas to validate the  concept of Shatkriyakala. This traditional knowledge can be utilized with modern  technologies to detect predisposition for cancer or diagnose cancer in its early  stages.","According to ""Ayurvedic concept of Shatkriyakala: a traditional knowledge of cancer pathogenesis and therapy"", the concept of Kriyakala in Ayurveda provides a framework to assess the progress and pathogenesis of a disease, like cancer, in different stages. All cancer therapies in Ayurveda aim to treat the affected tissues indirectly by eliminating vitiated Doshas (biological factors), rejuvenating Dhatus (body tissues), and restoring immunity in cancer patients. The six stages of disease progression, known as Shatkriyakala, can be used in conjunction with modern technologies for early detection and diagnosis of cancer."
What measures could be taken to better integrate practitioners of Ayurveda and Homeopathy in providing skilled birth attendant services in India?,"BACKGROUND: Shortage of skilled birth attendants (SBA) is one of the  determinants of maternal mortality in India. To combat this shortage, innovative  task-shifting strategies to engage providers of the Indian system of medicine  (Ayurveda and Homeopathy), called AYUSH practitioners (AP), to provide SBA  services is being implemented. METHODS: Engagement of APs for SBA service provision was assessed in 3 states of  India (Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Odisha) through 73 in-depth interviews (37  with APs and 36 with programme managers). The interviews explored the providers'  SBA training experience, barriers for SBA service provision, workplace and  community acceptance, and the perspective of programme managers on the  competence and quality of SBA services provided. RESULTS: SBA training led to skill enhancement with adoption of appropriate  maternal and newborn care practices. A dedicated trainer, more hands-on  practice, and strengthening training on newborn care practices and management of  complications emerged as the training needs. Conditional involvement in  SBA-related work, a discriminatory attitude at the workplace and lack of  legal/regulatory authorisation were identified as barriers to the inclusion of  APs in SBA service provision. CONCLUSIONS: Quality skill enhancement measures, an enabling work environment, a  systematic task-shifting process, role definition, supportive supervision and  credentialing could be key for the integration of APs and their acceptance in  the health system.","According to 'Task-shifting challenges for provision of skilled birth attendance: a qualitative exploration', AYUSH practitioners (Ayurveda and Homeopathy providers) in India are being trained and engaged in skilled birth attendance services to address the shortage of skilled birth attendants. The training led to skill enhancement and adoption of appropriate maternal and newborn care practices. However, challenges such as conditional involvement in work, workplace discrimination, and lack of legal authorization were identified. The paper suggests that quality skill enhancement measures, a supportive work environment, a systematic task-shifting process, clearly defined roles, supportive supervision, and credentialing could be beneficial for the integration and acceptance of AYUSH practitioners in the health system."

What is a natural remedy I can use to prevent the aggregation of lysozyme associated with amyloidosis?,"Lysozyme amyloidosis (ALys) is caused by the deposition of amyloid-like fibrils  of lysozyme in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys. The  treatment/prevention of ALys is not known yet. Therefore, searching for  therapeutic agents for amyloidosis is of great value. In this study, we have  examined the ability of the aqueous extract of herbalome (thirty herbal  components) of Chandraprabha vati (EHCV), a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, to  prevent fibrillation of lysozyme. Transmission electron microscopy and multiple  biophysical techniques were used to examine the processes. We found complete  inhibition of the fibrillation by EHCV, whereas none of the thirty ingredients  of EHCV was able to prevent the reaction, solely. We also found the EHCV induced  and stabilized secondary structures of aggregation-prone state (APS) of  lysozyme. Moreover, an increase in the secondary structure and stability of APS  were found to correlate with the inhibition reaction. We conclude that EHCV  modulates the structure and stability of APS and converts it into an aggregation  resistant state (ARS). We hypothesized that herbal components of Ayurvedic  formulation may provide a combination of molecules, which could efficiently  prevent aggregation reaction.","According to 'Herbalome of Chandraprabha vati, a polyherbal formulation of Ayurveda prevents fibrillation of lysozyme by stabilizing aggregation-prone intermediate state', the aqueous extract of the herbalome of Chandraprabha vati (EHCV), which is a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, has been found to prevent the fibrillation of lysozyme, a condition related to Lysozyme amyloidosis (ALys).

Can the traditional Indian medicine system Ayurveda offer any natural remedies for managing diabetes?,"BACKGROUND: In spite of the tremendous progress achieved in medical sciences in  the last century, the management of diabetes mellitus, a disease as old as  mankind, is poor. Diabetes is currently the world's largest endocrine disorder,  and estimates are that it affects almost 5% of the population. Ayurveda, the  Indian traditional system of medicine, is one of the world's oldest systems to  have documented the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. METHODS: Experimental studies performed in accordance with the modern medicine  principles have shown that some of the medicinal plants and polyherbal  preparations made using the plants used in Ayurveda are effective in preventing  both hyperglycemia and its complications. Syzygium jambolanum (Syn Syzygium  cumini, Eugenia cumini, Eugenia jambolana), commonly known as black plum and  originally indigenous to India, is one of the important antidiabetic plants. RESULTS: Jamun has been used in various complementary and alternative systems of  medicine and, before the discovery of insulin, was a frontline antidiabetic  medication even in Europe. The brew prepared by boiling the Jamun seeds in  boiling water has been used in the various traditional systems of medicine in  India.

Can Ayurvedic massage help in reducing chronic low back pain?,"OBJECTIVES: Ayurveda is one of the oldest comprehensive healthcare systems  worldwide. Ayurvedic massage and physical therapy are frequently used to treat  patients with chronic pain syndromes and disorders of the musculoskeletal  system. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic massage in  nonspecific chronic low back pain by means of a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN: Sixty-four patients (mean age, 54.8 years; 49 women and 15 men) with  chronic low back pain who scored >40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)  were randomly assigned to a 2-week massage group with 6 hours of Ayurvedic  massage and external treatment (n = 32) or to a 2-week local thermal therapy  group (n = 32). The study observation period was 4 weeks, consisting of a 2-week  intervention phase followed by a 2-week follow-up phase. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was the change of mean pain (VAS) from  baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included pain-related bothersomeness, the  Roland Disability Questionnaire, quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item  Short Form), the Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire for measuring back  pain-related disability, and psychological outcomes. Outcomes were assessed at  baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Mean back pain (primary outcome) at week 2 was significantly reduced  from 53.4 ± 18.5 to 21.6 ± 18.2 in the massage group and from 55.3 ± 12.9 to  41.8 ± 19.8 in the standard thermal therapy group (mean group difference, -18.7;  95% confidence interval, -28.7 to -8.7; p < 0.001). While beneficial effects on  pain-related bothersomeness and psychological well-being were also apparent, the  Ayurvedic intervention did not improve function or disability in the short-term  observation period. Both programs were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic external treatment is effective for pain-relief in  chronic low back pain in the short term. Further studies with longer observation  periods are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of the Ayurvedic external  treatment approach on function and disability.","According to the research paper titled ""Effectiveness of Ayurvedic Massage (Sahacharadi Taila) in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial"", Ayurvedic massage with Sahacharadi Taila is an effective treatment for pain relief in patients suffering from chronic low back pain in the short term.

Can Shilajit be harmful if consumed in excess due to its heavy metal content?,"‏Shilajit is used commonly as Ayurvedic medicine worldwide which is Rasayana  herbo-mineral substance and consumed to restore the energetic balance and to  prevent diseases like cognitive disorders and Alzheimer. Locally, Shilajit is  applied for patients diagnosed with bone fractures. For safety of the patients,  the elemental analysis of Shilajit is imperative to evaluate its nutritional  quality as well as contamination from heavy metals. The elemental composition of  Shilajit was conducted using three advanced analytical techniques (LIBS, ICP,  and EDX). For the comparative studies, the two Shilajit kinds mostly sold  globally produced in India and Pakistan were collected. Our main focus is to  highlight nutritional eminence and contamination of heavy metals to hinge on  Shilajit therapeutic potential. In this work, laser-induced breakdown  spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the  Shilajit. Our LIBS analysis revealed that Shilajit samples composed of several  elements like Ca, S, K, Mg, Al, Na, Sr, Fe, P, Si, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Co,  Pb, Cu, As, Hg, Se, and Ti. Indian and Pakistani Shilajits were highly enriched  with Ca, S, and K nutrients and contained Al, Sr, Mn, Ba, Zn, Ni, B, Cr, Pb, As,  and Hg toxins in amounts that exceeded the standard permissible limit. Even  though the content of most elements was comparable among both Shilajits,  nutrients, and toxins, in general, were accentuated more in Indian Shilajit with  the sole detection of Hg and Ti. The elemental quantification was done using  self-developed calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS)  method, and LIBS results are in well agreement with the concentrations  determined by standard ICP-OES/MS method. To verify our results by LIBS and  ICP-OES/MS techniques, EDX spectroscopy was also conducted which confirmed the  presence above mentioned elements. This work is highly significant for creating  awareness among people suffering due to overdose of this product and save many  human lives.","According to ""Rapid Determination and Quantification of Nutritional and Poisonous Metals in Vastly Consumed Ayurvedic Herbal Medicine (Rejuvenator Shilajit) by Humans Using Three Advanced Analytical Techniques"", Shilajit is a commonly used Ayurvedic medicine worldwide, consumed to restore energetic balance and prevent diseases like cognitive disorders and Alzheimer's.

Can following an Ayurvedic constitution-based diet help me lose weight?,"CONTEXT: Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medical system, is receivingincreasing  attention worldwide. OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study was conducted to determine the effectiveness  ofAyurvedic constitution-based diets on weight loss patterns of obese adults.  DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: Records of 200 obese adults, both  male and female, who had completed 3 months of the diet therapy at Ayurvedic  clinics, were examined and data collated. Techniques used included a checklist  of personality traits, physical signs, and food likes and dislikes to determine  the dosha. Based on the predominant doshas, diets were prescribed and closely  monitored for a period of 3 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Records of height and weight and chest, abdominal, waist, arm,  and thigh circumferences noted initially and after each month for the period of  3 months were obtained. RESULTS: Among the 200 subjects, 55 (27.5%) were vatta-, 83 (41.5%) were pitta-,  and 62 (31.0%) were kapha-predominant. At the beginning, kapha and pitta people  were heavier than vatta people. After the 3 months of therapy, the pitta group  lost the most weight (9.84%). The decrease in all the anthropometric  measurements was higher in pitta and kapha people than in vatta individuals.  Hence, diets based on Ayurvedic constitution may prove useful in promoting  weight loss. Though these promising findings support traditional Indian  Ayurvedic scriptures, more closely controlled trials are needed to substantiate  these findings.","According to 'Diets based on Ayurvedic constitution--potential for weight management', Ayurvedic constitution-based diets may be effective for weight loss in obese adults. The study found that after a 3-month period of closely monitored diets based on their predominant doshas, the pitta group lost the most weight with a decrease of 9.84%.

"Can Ayurveda practices, such as yoga and the use of certain herbs, aid in the treatment of heart disease and hypertension?","Ayurveda is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, namely, ""Ayus"" and ""Veda,"" meaning  life and knowledge, respectively. It literally means science of life. Ayurveda,  of which yoga is an integral part, is widely practiced in India and is gaining  acceptance in many countries around the world. It is a comprehensive and a  holistic system, the focus of which is on the body, mind, and consciousness. The  Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal preparations, diet, yoga,  meditation, and other practices. Based on the review of available studies, the  evidence is not convincing that any Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective in  the treatment of heart disease or hypertension. However, the use of certain  spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in an overall healthy diet is  appropriate. Many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners show promise and could  be appropriate for larger randomized trials. Yoga, an integral part of Ayurveda,  has been shown to be useful to patients with heart disease and hypertension.  Yoga reduces anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life. Its  safety profile is excellent. Its use as a complementary therapeutic regimen  under medical supervision is appropriate and could be worth considering.","According to 'Ayurveda and yoga in cardiovascular diseases', Ayurvedic remedies primarily include the use of herbal preparations, diet, yoga, and meditation. While it is noted that there is not convincing evidence that any specific Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective for heart disease or hypertension, the inclusion of spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in a healthy diet is deemed appropriate. The practice of yoga, a key component of Ayurveda, has been found to be beneficial for patients with heart disease and hypertension, reducing anxiety, promoting well-being, and improving quality of life.

Are there any safety concerns related to the use of Ayurvedic medicines from the Ras-family?,"Fifteen Ayurvedic medicines of Ras-family (herbo-mineral-metallic preparations)  from three reputed manufactures were analysed for elemental quantification and  their chemical phase identification using the energy-dispersive (ED) and  wavelength-dispersive (WD) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques, and powder X-ray  diffraction (XRD) technique, respectively. The low-Z elements C, H, N, S and O  constituting a major portion of these medicines were also determined by CHNSO  analyser and further used as input for XRF analyses. The elements of concern,  Hg, Pb and As, are identified in different medicine products with disquiet  concentration values (maximum concentration values range ~ 4-10%) and that too  with substantial variations in the products from different manufacturers. These  elements are identified mainly in the cinnabar (α-HgS)/metacinnabar (β-HgS),  litharge (PbO) and alacranite (As4S4) phases in different medicines. Keeping in  view the high concentration of chemicals of the Hg, Pb and As elements in the  Ras-family medicines, it is vitally required to investigate their  bioaccessibility and surmise the associated toxicological aspects. It is  suggested that the formation of the bioaccessible toxic chemical forms of the  Hg, Pb and As elements be avoided during preparation of the mineral ingredients  or these soluble chemical forms be removed at suitable stage of the preparation.  In view of large variations observed for the Hg, Pb and As based ingredients in  the Ras family Ayurvedic medicine products from different manufacturers,  adequate quality control mechanisms and production regulations are recommended.","According to 'Elemental and Chemical Phase Analyses of Ras-Family Ayurvedic Medicinal Products', fifteen Ayurvedic medicines of the Ras-family (herbo-mineral-metallic preparations) were analyzed.

What can I do to improve the effectiveness of my Triphala supplement for gingivitis and hyperlipidemia?,"Triphala is a well-known prescription in Indian Ayurveda and TCM medicine for  its great effect on gingivitis and hyperlipidemia. However, its solution is  unstable for the containing of excessive polyphenol, leading to the production  of sediment in the short term and the decrease of efficacy. Based on the  analysis of sediment formation, a novel control strategy is proposed. To conduct  the analysis, the sediment formation was recorded for a consecutive five days.  The changes in the composition of the supernatant and the sediment were studied  by the HPLC profile analysis. The main components of the sediment were  identified as corilagin, ellagic acid and gallic acid, and the amount of ellagic  acid sediment increased with the storage time. Then, with a series of pH status  adjustments of the Triphala solution, the physical and chemical stabilities were  acquired by Turbiscan and HPLC respectively. The results showed that as the pH  value increased, so did the physical stability, but the particle size and TSI of  the association decreased. While the fingerprint of chemical profile similarity  decreased, so did the chemical stability. Combining physical and chemical  stability parameters, an equilibrium point was found out. When the pH value was  adjusted to 5.0, both the physical and chemical stabilities were better: the  verification test showed that the sedimentation inhibition rates on the 3rd,  5th,10th and15th days were 41%, 55%, 41%, and 23%, respectively. This manuscript  provided a new control strategy that will pique pharmaceutical and food  development engineers' interest and trigger research ideas controlling the  quality of decoction.","According to 'Study on the stability control strategy of Triphala solution based on the balance of physical stability and chemical stabilities', Triphala, a traditional Indian Ayurvedic and TCM medicine, is effective in treating gingivitis and hyperlipidemia.

Is Ayurvedic medicine effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis?,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on  the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Computerized literature searches for all RCTs of Ayurvedic medicine for  RA in the following databases: Medline (March 1969 to March 2003), Embase  (February 1985 to February 2003), AMED (March 1980 to March 2003), Cochrane  Controlled Trial Register (October 1997 to March 2003), and the abstract service  of Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS; 1976 to March  2003). Hand searches were performed in 1 Sri Lankan and 3 Indian journals and  the authors' personal files. Key data of included studies were extracted and  reviewed. The methodological quality of all studies was evaluated with the Jadad  scale. RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Trials tested either  Ayurvedic medicine against placebo or other Ayurvedic medicines. In general,  patient and physician global assessments on the severity of pain, and morning  stiffness were used as endpoints. Of 3 placebo-controlled RCTs, 1 high-quality  trial did not show benefit of the active treatment against placebo, while  another incompletely reported study indicated beneficial effects of an Ayurvedic  medicine. A further incompletely reported study showed no significant  difference. The remaining 4 trials were difficult to interpret because they  tested an Ayurvedic medicine against other Ayurvedic medicines whose effects  were not proven. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of RCTs of Ayurvedic medicines for RA. The  existing RCTs fail to show convincingly that such treatments are effective  therapeutic options for RA.","According to ""Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review,"" there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to conclusively prove the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for rheumatoid arthritis. Some trials indicated potential benefits, while others did not show significant improvement or were inconclusive due to methodological issues. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that Ayurvedic treatments are effective therapeutic options for rheumatoid arthritis based on the current available research."

The practical challenges to be considered include a gross divergence in  the basic philosophy of practice; disparities in approach to specific clinical  conditions; differences in their normative approach in decision making; an  unclear policy for cross referral and problems of cross practice that could  potentially rise in this condition. Mainstreaming of AYUSH into the existing  public health system can have certain ethical implications: not doing good by  failing to concentrate on the community value judgments about AYUSH; doing harm  by a confusing plurality in approach and unhealthy segregation of practices  without healthy dialogue between practitioners of either system; not disclosing  which type of practitioners (AYUSH or allopathy) the patient is seeing; lack of  proper public accountability mechanisms at the primary care and grassroots  levels; and, finally, lack of social justice. These ethical issues have to be  considered while mainstreaming AYUSH.","According to ""Mainstreaming AYUSH: an ethical analysis"", the National Rural Health Mission is working to incorporate the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) systems into Indian healthcare to address human resource shortages. This effort involves training AYUSH practitioners on primary care and national health programs, establishing AYUSH departments in district and taluka level hospitals, and setting up AYUSH centres of excellence for referrals and research. However, several challenges need to be addressed such as differences in practice philosophy, disparities in clinical approaches, unclear cross-referral policies, and potential issues with cross-practice. Moreover, ethical implications such as not focusing on community value judgments about AYUSH"
What lifestyle changes can I make according to Ayurveda to promote overall well-being and longevity?,"Ayurveda is a natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000  years ago. Its main objective is to achieve optimal health and well-being  through a comprehensive approach that addresses mind, body, behavior, and  environment. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention and health promotion, and provides  treatment for disease. It considers the development of consciousness to be  essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving  this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the  psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and  lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year. Common spices are  utilized in treatment, as well as herbs and herbal mixtures, and special  preparations known as Rasayanas are used for rejuvenation, promotion of  longevity, and slowing of the aging process. A group of purification procedures  known as Panchakarma removes toxins from the physiology. Whereas Western  allopathic medicine is excellent in handling acute medical crises, Ayurveda  demonstrates an ability to manage chronic disorders that Western medicine has  been unable to. It may be projected from Ayurveda's comprehensive approach,  emphasis on prevention, and ability to manage chronic disorders that its  widespread use would improve the health status of the world's population.","According to ""Utilization of Ayurveda in health care: an approach for prevention, health promotion, and treatment of disease.

What are some alternative treatments I could consider for skin conditions and how safe are they?,"According to survey data, 35-69% of patients with skin disease have used  complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in their lifetime. A literature  search on this subject reveals a number of studies on the efficacy of CAM  treatment for dermatologic conditions, as well as a number of articles showing  the growing prevalence of CAM use amongst patients suffering from these  conditions. Given the consensus amongst these articles that dermatologists  require increased education on CAM, this paper presents an overview of some of  the most widely used systems of alternative medicine to serve as a tool for  practicing dermatologists. Specifically, the history and theory behind  psychocutaneous therapies, traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture),  homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine will be described, along with current  evidence for their efficacy and reports of their adverse effects. The authors  conclude that more evidence and better studies are needed for each of the major  CAM modalities before they may be considered as independent therapeutic options.  Moreover, given the shortage of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of  CAM, dermatologists should obtain a thorough history of CAM use from their  patients. In general, ingestible substances including most homeopathic,  Ayurvedic, and traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulations that are not US  FDA regulated should be viewed with caution as they may cause severe adverse  effects such as arsenicosis and hepatotoxicity. On the other hand, less invasive  techniques such as acupuncture and psychocutaneous therapies may be more  acceptable given their low-risk profile. Ultimately, until the availability of  more sound data, these treatments should primarily be used in combination with  conventional treatment and rarely independently.","According to ""Complementary and alternative medicine in dermatology: an overview of selected modalities for the practicing dermatologist"", Ayurvedic medicine is among the most widely used systems of alternative medicine for skin conditions. However, more evidence and better studies are needed before these modalities, including Ayurvedic medicine, can be considered as standalone therapeutic options. Dermatologists are advised to obtain a thorough history of CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) use from their patients. Most Ayurvedic formulations that are not regulated by the US FDA should be viewed with caution due to potential severe adverse effects. Until more reliable data is available, these treatments should primarily be used in combination with conventional treatment rather than independently."
What are the safety regulations for herbal health products globally?,"Background: Regulatory affairs play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical  industry and are incorporated in all stages of drug development. Objective:  Approval criteria practices were developed as a resolution of the government's  desire to create policies to protect public health by controlling the safety and  efficacy of merchandise in areas including pharmaceuticals, complementary color  medicines, veterinary medicines, medical devices, and even food products and  cosmetics. Method: Herbal health products are in practices in all parts of the  world under either their legal system's or expert council's or agencies' guides.  They include botanicals, health supplements, health foods, complimentary  medicines, traditional medicines or following pathies like Ayurveda, Yoga,  Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The requisite parameters for registration or  recognition of products by various major global regulatory agencies were  reviewed, and compiled under purview. Results: In India, licensing these  products is under the act provisions and the rules known as the Drugs and  Cosmetics Act, whereas globally regulatory provisions follow the guidelines of  developed countries like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European  Medicines Agency, the Therapeutic Goods Act, or the World Health Organization's  regulations for herbal products. Conclusions: The present communication  highlights the provisions of regulatory and/or licensing requirements related to  corporates, product composition, specifications, quality parameters,  manufacturing methodology, stability, safety, preclinical studies, clinical  studies, etc. for herbal products and the respective guidelines at one site.  Highlights: Ultimately, all regulatory agencies across the world highlight  majorly the safety and thereafter the efficacy for any products under the  category.","According to ""Regulatory Aspects of Traditional Indian Medicines (TIM) in India and in International Purview"", herbal products, including those used in Ayurveda, are regulated under different guidelines globally.

How do Ayurvedic principles guide the treatment plans of practitioners?,"BACKGROUND: The curricula of Ayurveda programmes emphasise various theoretical  constructs such as Tridosha (three factors determining the state of health),  Agnibala (digestive strength), Samprapti (patho-physiology), among others. It is  often argued that practitioners follow an individualised approach based on these  principles while treating patients. Yet, dependable data on their real-world  influence is lacking. The aim of this study was to record the extent to which  these constructs drive decision-making among Ayurveda practitioners and to  examine whether these constructs determine individualisation of the  interventions. METHODS: We employed an emailed survey to record physicians' perceptions.  Convenience sampling was chosen as the sampling method. Registered Ayurveda  practitioners located across India with a minimum of five years of clinical  experience were invited to participate. Five case-based scenarios depicting  different clinical conditions were presented to the physicians. Questions that  accompanied each case scenario asked the physicians to record clinical  diagnoses, treatment plans, and the Ayurveda principles that determined their  treatment. RESULTS: A total of 141 physicians responded, from whom we received 152  responses as seven physicians responded to more than one scenario. The results  suggest a significant lack of consensus among physicians regarding clinical  diagnoses, interventions, and their understanding of pathophysiology in the  given clinical scenarios. Many conflicting opinions were also noted. CONCLUSION: Theoretical constructs do not appear to determine either  prescriptions or individualisation uniformly. Two ethical questions arise: ""Is  this situation due to an inherently weak theoretical framework of Ayurveda?"" and  ""How can one justify spending hundreds of hours teaching these theories?""","According to ""Myth and reality of ""theory-driven individualised practice"" in Ayurveda: Mapping physicians' approaches using case-based scenarios"", the key Ayurvedic concepts such as Tridosha (three factors determining the state of health), Agnibala (digestive strength), and Samprapti (patho-physiology) do not seem to uniformly determine the prescriptions or individualisation of treatment among practitioners. The study found a significant lack of consensus among Ayurveda physicians regarding clinical diagnoses, interventions, and their understanding of pathophysiology in given clinical scenarios."
What precautions should I take when buying ayurvedic drugs during my trip to India?,"Lead intoxication in adults without occupational exposure is a rare and  unexpected event. The case of a western European is reported who had severe  anaemia after ingestion of several ayurvedic drugs, obtained during a trip to  India. Laboratory findings showed high blood lead concentrations, an increased  urinary lead concentration, and an increased urinary excretion of  delta-aminolaevulinic acid. Also, slightly increased urinary concentrations of  arsenic and silver were found. Physicians should be aware that with growing  international travel and rising self medication with drugs from uncontrolled  sources the risk of drug induced poisoning could increase in the future.","According to 'Lead induced anaemia due to traditional Indian medicine: a case report', the ingestion of several Ayurvedic drugs led to severe anaemia in a patient due to high blood lead concentrations.

What are some traditional methods used in Sri Lanka to treat animal diseases?,"Systems for preventing and treating animal diseases have been employed in Sri  Lanka since ancient times, long before the advent of modern veterinary science.  Many such methods have been used, mainly in ruminants but also in trained  elephants. Records of animal treatments can be found in historical documents.  The first recorded treatment is that of the elephant 'Kadol Etha' belonging to  King Dutugemunu (161-137 BC). Later, the physician King Buddhadasa (AD 340-368)  is reported to have operated on a snake. The methods and experience gained by  practitioners have usually been passed on in secrecy from father to son.  However, records on ola leaf manuscripts are available for consultation in the  National Museum and the Ayurvedic Research Institute, while others are in the  possession of native veterinary practitioners. Approximately 2,000 practitioners  are scattered throughout the island; the majority treat animals on a part-time  basis. The marking of animals using brands in symbolic shapes, inhalation of  medicinal fumes and oral medication are the common treatment methods.","According to 'Traditional systems for preventing and treating animal diseases in Sri Lanka', Ayurvedic remedies for animals in Sri Lanka include the marking of animals using brands in symbolic shapes, inhalation of medicinal fumes, and oral medication.

What Ayurvedic remedies could help protect against the harmful effects of radiation treatment in cancer?,"The use of ionizing radiation, which is the cornerstone of cancer treatment, is  compromised by the radiosensitivity of normal tissues. A chemical that can give  selective benefit to the normal cells against the deleterious effects of  ionizing radiation has been a long-sought goal. However, most of the compounds  studied have shown inadequate clinical application owing to their inherent  toxicity, undesirable side effects, and high cost. Studies carried out in the  past 2 decades have shown that some of the classical Indian Ayurvedic drugs  (Amritaprasham, Ashwagandha Rasayana, Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha, Narasimha  Rasayana, and Triphala Churna) possess radioprotective effects. In the current  review, an attempt is made to summarize the radioprotective observations of  these Ayurvedic drugs and the mechanisms responsible for the radioprotective  effects.","According to 'Rasayana drugs from the Ayurvedic system of medicine as possible radioprotective agents in cancer treatment', the classical Indian Ayurvedic drugs Amritaprasham, Ashwagandha Rasayana, Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha, Narasimha Rasayana, and Triphala Churna have been shown to possess radioprotective effects. These Ayurvedic drugs can potentially confer selective benefit to normal cells against the harmful effects of ionizing radiation, which is commonly used in cancer treatment."
What are some ways to incorporate Vedic principles into my mental health routine?,"This paper introduces Vedic principles of therapy as a holistic integration of  healing and human development. The most integrative aspect is a  ""consciousness-based"" approach in which the bottom line of the mind is  consciousness itself, accessed by transcending mental activity to its simplest  ground state. This directly contrasts with ""unconscious-based"" approaches that  hold the basis of conscious mind is the unconscious, such as analytic,  humanistic, and cognitive-behavioral approaches. Although not presented as a  specific therapeutic approach, interventions associated with this Vedic approach  have extensive support in the applied research literature. A brief review of  experimental research toward a general model of mind-and cutting-edge  developments in quantum physics toward nonlocal mind-shows a convergence on the  ancient Vedic model of mind. Comparisons with contemporary therapies further  show that the simplicity, subtlety, and holistic nature of the Vedic approach  represent a significant advance over approaches which have overlooked the  fundamental ground state of the mind.","According to 'Vedic principles of therapy', the key Ayurvedic remedy information suggests a ""consciousness-based"" approach to therapy and healing. This approach involves accessing the simplest ground state of the mind by transcending mental activity. The Vedic approach is described as simple, subtle, and holistic, representing a significant advance over other therapeutic approaches. The approach has extensive support in the applied research literature, though it is not presented as a specific therapeutic method."
What are the health benefits of the Holarrhena pubescens plant in traditional medicine?,"Holarrhena pubescens is an important medicinal plant of the Apocynaceae family  that is widely distributed over the Indian subcontinent. The plant is  extensively used in Ayurveda and other traditional medicinal systems without  obvious adverse effects. Beside notable progress in the biological and  phytochemical evaluation of this plant over the past few years, comprehensive  reviews of H. pubescens are limited in scope. It has economic importance due to  the extensive use of seeds as an antidiabetic. Furthermore, the plant is  extensively reported in traditional uses among the natives of Asia and Africa,  while scientifical validation for various ailments has not been studied either  in vitro or in vivo. This review aims to summarize information on the  pharmacology, traditional uses, active constituents, safety and toxicity of H.  pubescens. Chemical analysis of H. pubescens extracts revealed the presence of  several bioactive compounds, such as conessine, isoconnessine, conessimine,  conimine, conessidine, conkurchicine, holarrhimine, conarrhimine, mokluangin A-D  and antidysentericine.

Can the taste of a medicinal plant predict its health benefits according to Ayurvedic principles?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Taste (rasa) is traditionally valued in Ayurveda  as an important ethnopharmacological category, and reported to correlate with  certain therapeutic activities (karman). The present paper endeavors to provide  for the first time a type of mapping of ayurvedic ethnopharmacological space by  the integration of medicinal plant taste-activity relationship (TA) data,  originating from several traditional sources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present TA database included 183 ayurvedic medicinal  plants, with their traditional description of taste and ethnophamacological  actions (EPA). 111 plants had a unique taste, and 72 plants a combination of  several tastes, consisting of one principal taste, and other 2-4 secondary  tastes. 121 ethnopharmacological actions were considered. Potential global or  individual associations between rasa and karman were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant global correspondence between the  predominant plant taste and the ethnopharmacological activities (Chi-square  test, p<0.05), and the following individual associations (Fisher exact test,  p<0.05, positive association if lnOR >0, negative association if lnOR <0):  bitter- 11 positive associations (lnOR 0.940 to 3.544) and 8 negative  associations (lnOR -0.997 to -3.101), sweet- 14 positive associations (lnOR  0.839 to 3.132) and 20 negative associations (lnOR -0.962 to -3.270), pungent-  23 positive associations (lnOR 0.835 to 4.126) and 11 negative associations  (lnOR -1.255 to -3.147), astringent- 7 positive associations (lnOR 1.099 to  3.813) and 7 negative associations (lnOR -1.076 to -2.631), sour- 7 positive  associations (lnOR 1.128 to 4.664) and 1 negative association (lnOR -2.244).  Among the 109 statistically significant associations, 24 were not traditionally  mentioned, and only 4 were in opposition with the traditional ayurvedic sources. DISCUSSIONS: The present study confirms the traditional relationship rasa-karman  and demonstrates that statistical models can be used to predict EPAs of  medicinal plants depending on their taste. Integration of the ayurvedic concept  of taste into ethnopharmacological research might reveal new facets of plant  therapeutic potentials and provide a framework for developing a probabilistic  approach to drug discovery that can be exploited to increase bioprospecting  research efficacy.","According to 'Taste of medicinal plants: A potential tool in predicting ethnopharmacological activities?', the taste, or 'rasa', of a medicinal plant is a significant factor in Ayurvedic medicine and is believed to be linked to the plant's therapeutic activities, or 'karman'.

Individual associations were also found, such as bitter taste having 11 positive associations and 8 negative associations with different therapeutic activities. Other tastes like sweet, pungent, astringent, and sour, also exhibited various positive and negative associations. The research supports the traditional Ayurvedic belief in the rasa"
Can Ayurvedic herbs be effective in the treatment or management of COVID-19?,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has sparked a new  spectrum of investigations, research and studies in multifarious directions.  Efforts are being made around the world for discovery of effective  vaccines/drugs against COVID-19. In this context, Ayurveda, an alternative  traditional system of medicine in India may work as an adjuvant therapy in  compromised patients. We selected 40 herbal leads on the basis of their  traditional applications. The phytomolecules from these leads were further  screened through in-silico molecular docking against two main targets of  SARS-CoV-2 i.e. the spike protein (S; structural protein) and the main protease  (MPRO; non-structural protein). Out of the selected 40, 12 phytomolecules were  able to block or stabilize the major functional sites of the main protease and  spike protein. Among these, Ginsenoside, Glycyrrhizic acid, Hespiridin and  Tribulosin exhibited high binding energy with both main protease and spike  protein. Etoposide showed good binding energy only with Spike protein and  Teniposide had high binding energy only with main protease. The above  phytocompounds showed promising binding efficiency with target proteins  indicating their possible applications against SARS-CoV-2. However, these  findings need to be validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments with  above mentioned potential molecules as candidate drugs for the management of  COVID-19.

The  top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further  validated by 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation run. The stability of the  conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy  using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were  also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein  RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent  compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc  and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a  strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In  contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp  and quercetin with main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target  proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore,  compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral  replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own  multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance  therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in  vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of  antiviral plants preventively.","According to ""Repurposing potential of Ayurvedic medicinal plants derived active principles against SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins revealed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA studies"", the Ayurvedic compounds gingerol, curcumin, and quercetin have shown potential as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. Curcumin has demonstrated a strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. Gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein and the RdRp of the virus. Quercetin has shown strong interactions with the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. These compounds could potentially be used alone or in combination to enhance therapeutic efficacy against"
What are some Ayurvedic practices that could help in maintaining a healthy heart?,"Early awakening and early to bed as well as good conduct, thought, diet,  interpersonal dealings and physical activity have been suggested for healthy  life in Ayurveda. Circadian rhythms, coordinated in part by the parietal  hypothalamic-pituitary and adrenal mechanisms, have been reported in almost all  variables examined thus far, including the circulation. It is possible that all  metabolic functions undergo circadian rhythms. It remains to be explored whether  these rhythms may be optimized by Ayurvedic practices. The onsets of myocardial  ischemia, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death,  and strokes have been reported to exhibit a circadian variation, with increased  frequency in the second quarter of the day. An increased physical and mental  load caused by an attempt to prepare for the day may be important in triggering  acute cardiovascular events. Depending on their timing, meditation (Ayurvedic  practice), n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, beta-blockers and estrogens may have  beneficial effects, whereas progestins and mental load may have adverse effects  on heart rate and blood pressure variability, which may be expressed by  different circadian patterns. Around the clock serial recordings of blood  pressure and heart rate during usual activities and lifestyles may be recorded  and may be analyzed by computer-implemented curve fitting to assess the about  24-hour (circadian) variation, among other rhythmic, chaotic, and trend  components of the time structure (chronome) of these variables. The new disease  risk syndrome circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), a condition  characterized by an excessive circadian amplitude of blood pressure, cannot be  ascertained on the basis of single casual blood pressure measurements. The  International Chronome Ecological Study of Heart Rate (and blood pressure)  Variability in various ethnic groups aims at collecting further evidence  regarding the role of blood pressure and heart rate variability in the  pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, while also examining any role played by  ethnicity and lifestyle-associated factors.","According to ""New insights into circadian aspects of health and disease"", Ayurvedic practices like early awakening, early to bed, good conduct, thought, diet, interpersonal dealings, and physical activity are suggested for a healthy life. These practices might optimize the circadian rhythms of metabolic functions.

Can the herb Bacopa monnieri help prevent cognitive decline caused by the antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam during pregnancy?,"OBJECTIVES: Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic recommended during  pregnancy. Bacopa monneri is a medicinal herb used in Ayurveda for improvement  of cognition. Data on effects of LEV and Bacopa on cognition is inadequate. The  study evaluated the cognitive effects of LEV on rat offspring of dams exposed to  LEV and whether pretreatment with Bacopa monnieri, inhibits the potential  cognitive decline by LEV. METHODS: Pregnant rats were allocated into four groups of three rats each.  Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 received 2% gum acacia, LEV 270 mg/kg, LEV  270 mg/kg + Bacopa 100 mg/kg and LEV 270 mg/kg + Bacopa 200 mg/kg respectively  during pregnancy and lactation. Three pups from all dams were chosen at random  and exposed to passive avoidance, Hebb-Williams and Morris water maze tests to  check for their cognition and relevant histopathology was done. RESULTS: In the passive avoidance model groups 3 and 4, showed an increase in  escape latency compared with group 2, demonstrating an improved learning  (p=0.05). In Hebb-Williams maze, the time taken to reach reward chamber by group  2 increased compared to group 1, p=0.006, showing cognitive decline. Neuronal  count in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex decreased significantly in group 2,  which improved in group 3 & 4 however there was distortion of architecture in  group 4. CONCLUSIONS: LEV exposure in intrauterine and neonatal period induced cognitive  decline in rat offsprings and Bacopa 100 mg/kg prevented LEV induced cognitive  decline. However safety of exposure to Bacopa during the gestation period has to  be evaluated.","According to ""Levetiracetam exposure during prenatal and postnatal period induces cognitive decline in rat offsprings, not completely prevented by Bacopa monnieri,"" the Ayurvedic medicinal herb Bacopa monnieri, used for cognitive improvement, has shown potential in preventing cognitive decline induced by Levetiracetam (an antiepileptic drug) in rat offspring. The study utilized doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of Bacopa, in conjunction with 270 mg/kg of Levetiracetam, during pregnancy and lactation. However, the safety of Bacopa exposure during gestation still needs to be evaluated."

What kind of alternative therapies are commonly used by patients with rheumatoid arthritis in India?,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) enjoys widespread  popularity in chronic illnesses such as rheumatic diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) is the commonest inflammatory joint disease seen in clinical practice. No  systematic study on the use of CAM by patients with RA is available from  northern India. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence and usage characteristics of CAM in Indian  patients with RA using a questionnaire at a tertiary care centre in northern  India. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients with RA included in the study, 39% reported current  CAM use. As many as 84 respondents (82%) reported having tried CAM during the  course of their disease. A total of 215 CAM courses were used, out of which 77  were being continued. Ayurveda was the commonest (28% courses) followed by  homoeopathy (20%), yoga asana (17%) and pranayama (12%). Pain control was the  primary reason for using CAM (69% of users). Most CAM therapies (78%) were  started on the advice of friends and relatives. Discontinuation of CAM was  attributed to lack of clinical benefit (78%) and adverse effects (10%). Of the  patients using CAM, 87% did not reveal its use to their physicians, primarily  because the physician did not enquire about it. CONCLUSION: Patients with RA frequently use CAM for pain control. These  practices are often not revealed to the treating physician.

Can Ayurvedic medicines help in managing the symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder?,"RATIONALE: Ayurvedic herbal medicines are administered as part of disease  management for many neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder  (ASD) and linked comorbid challenges. The biochemistry of the behavioral  abnormalities as observed in comorbid conditions is already reported to involve  neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT) and  dopamine (DA). The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of ayurvedic  medicines on neurotransmitter levels in IMR 32. Such a study will give some  insight into the molecular mechanism of the action of these medicines and help  us to understand their contributions in neurotransmitter homeostasis. METHODS: Solutions of Brahmi, Brahmi vati, Brahmi ghrita and Saraswata ghrita,  each at 50 μM, were added to differentiated IMR 32 cells and grown for 24 h. The  cell secretion was analysed by ultra-fast liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometry (UFLC/MS) in electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode for the  neurotransmitters DA, 5-HT and GABA. The mobile phase selected was 0.1% formic  acid with 15 μg/mL Na2 -EDTA (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B)  introduced in the ratio of 92:8. RESULTS: All neurotransmitters under study were eluted within 7 min with GABA  eluting at 3.82 min, 5-HT at 4.48 min and DA at 5.47 min, respectively.  Linearity was excellent with a correlation coefficient (R(2) ) of 0.999;  repeatability and accuracy were also within acceptable range. All herbal drugs  evaluated increased the neurotransmitter levels and Brahmi vati increased the  neurotransmitter levels to a larger extent. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased levels of neurotransmitters were observed in behavioral  abnormalities which were also observed in children with ASD. Herbal medicines  given as part of ayurvedic medicine increased the neurotransmitter levels in IMR  32. Thus, these ayurvedic medicines when prescribed to children with ASD might  alleviate the abnormal behavioral symptoms by maintaining neurotransmitter  homeostasis.

Can the herbal formulation Siotone help reduce stress and improve mental health?,"Siotone (ST) is a herbal formulation comprising of Withania somnifera, Ocimum  sanctum, Asparagus racemosus, Tribulus terristris and shilajit, all of which are  classified in Ayurveda as rasayanas which are reputed to promote physical and  mental health, improve defence mechanisms of the body and enhance longevity.  These attributes are similar to the modern concept of adaptogenic agents, which  are, known to afford protection of the human physiological system against  diverse stressors. The present study was undertaken to investigate the  adaptogenic activity of ST against chronic unpredictable, but mild, footshock  stress induced perturbations in behaviour (depression), glucose metabolism,  suppressed male sexual behaviour, immunosuppression and cognitive dysfunction in  CF strain albino rats. Gastric ulceration, adrenal gland and spleen weights,  ascorbic acid and corticosterone concentrations of adrenal cortex, and plasma  corticosterone levels, were used as the stress indices. Panax ginseng (PG) was  used as the standard adaptogenic agent for comparison. Additionally, rat brain  levels of tribulin, an endogenous endocoid postulated to be involved in stress,  were also assessed in terms of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and MAOB  inhibitory activity. Chronic unpredictable footshock induced marked gastric  ulceration, significant increase in adrenal gland weight and plasma  corticosterone levels, with concomitant decreases in spleen weight, and  concentrations of adrenal gland ascorbic acid and corticosterone. These effects  were attenuated by ST (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg, p.o.),  administered once daily over a period of 14 days, the period of stress  induction. Chronic stress also induced glucose intolerance, suppressed male  sexual behaviour, induced behavioural depression (Porsolt's swim despair test  and learned helplessness test) and cognitive dysfunction (attenuated retention  of learning in active and passive avoidance tests), and immunosuppression  (leucocyte migration inhibition and sheep RBC challenged increase in paw oedema  in sensitized rats). All these chronic stress-induced perturbations were  attenuated, dose-dependently by ST (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg,  p.o.). Chronic stress-induced increase in rat brain tribulin activity was also  reversed by these doses of ST and by PG. The results indicate that ST has  significant adaptogenic activity, qualitatively comparable to PG, against a  variety of behavioural, biochemical and physiological perturbations induced by  unpredictable stress, which has been proposed to be a better indicator of  clinical stress than acute stress parameters. The likely contribution of the  individual constituents of ST in the observed adaptogenic action of the  polyherbal formulation, have been discussed.","According to 'Adaptogenic activity of Siotone, a polyherbal formulation of Ayurvedic rasayanas', Siotone (ST) is a herbal remedy comprising Withania somnifera, Ocimum sanctum, Asparagus racemosus, Tribulus terristris and shilajit.

What precautions should I take when using Ayurvedic medicines to avoid lead poisoning?,"Ayurvedic medicines have been gaining in popularity around the world in recent  decades, but have also been associated with lead contamination and poisoning. In  2012 in Durban, South Africa, a lead poisoning outbreak among adolescents was  associated with the consumption of an Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of  skin conditions. In 2014 eight individuals (out of 12 affected) were traced and  interviewed. Questionnaires were administered; blood samples were taken for lead  content analysis; and medical records were reviewed. Samples of the implicated  medicines were analyzed to determine lead levels. Blood lead levels during the  acute phase ranged from 34 to 116 µg/dL; and during the current study (two years  later) from 13 to 34 µg/dL. The implicated lead capsules had a lead content of  125,235 µg/g. Participants suffered a wide range of non-specific ill health  symptoms; and there was a significant delay in the diagnosis of lead poisoning.  This study highlights the potential for lead poisoning outbreaks from the  consumption of Ayurvedic medicines in African settings. There were weaknesses  with regard to the diagnosis of and response to the outbreak, for which measures  need to be put in place to ensure greater awareness of the role of Ayurvedic  medicine in lead poisoning, and prompt diagnosis and treatment of future cases.","According to ""Retrospective Investigation of a Lead Poisoning Outbreak from the Consumption of an Ayurvedic Medicine: Durban, South Africa"", an Ayurvedic medicine used for the treatment of skin conditions was found to be associated with a lead poisoning outbreak in Durban, South Africa in 2012.

What are some benefits of using Rasasindura as an Ayurvedic treatment?,"Rasasindura (RS) is an Ayurvedic medicine, which contains ∼99% α-HgS. It is used  as a rejuvenating agent and commonly used to treat diseases such as syphilis,  insomnia, high fever, and nervous disorders. Cinnabar ore (α-HgS) is a  well-known mineral, which is readily available. Despite it, Ayurvedic  practitioners adopted an involved and tedious procedure for the preparation of  RS. In this study, three samples, one was Ayurvedic (RS), the second one was the  commercial (HGS), and the third one was cinnabar ore (CN), were physiochemically  examined. Zebrafish model was employed for toxicity study with an oral dose of  100 mg/kg/day for the three samples for 10 days. We found that RS conferred  novel physicochemical properties, which were not seen in HGS and CN.  Significantly, the average crystallite size of RS was lowest (26 nm) as compared  to HGS (31 nm) and CN (34 nm), and the rate of increase of crystallite size with  temperature was lowest in RS. RS did not show any significant behavioral  toxicity in zebrafish, which was seen with the HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish.  HGS-and CN-treated zebrafish showed a significantly high (∗∗∗p < 0.001) decrease  (77 ± 7.6% and 51 ± 6.5%, respectively) of glutathione (GSH) levels in the  brain, however, for RS-treated zebrafish, the change of GSH was insignificant  (26 ± 2.5%, p > 0.05). Interestingly, HGS significantly altered the  γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in brain tissue. Therefore, among all three samples,  RS exhibited the lowest toxicity, which can be credited to the distinct  toxicokinetics by these samples.","According to ""Ayurvedic processing of α-HgS gives novel physicochemistry and distinct toxicokinetics in zebrafish"", Rasasindura (RS) is an Ayurvedic medicine containing approximately 99% α-HgS, used for treating conditions such as syphilis, insomnia, high fever, and nervous disorders.

Can Ayurveda provide a personalized approach to managing my health based on my genetic makeup?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, India's natural health care tradition, has a unique way of  classifying human population based on individual constitution or prakriti.  Ayurveda's tridosha theory identifies principles of motion (vata), metabolism  (pitta), and structure (kapha) as discrete phenotypic groupings. Patwardhan et  al. (2005) hypothesized in a paper published in this journal that there is a  genetic connotation to prakriti and as proof of this concept showed a  correlation between HLA alleles and prakriti type, establishing a rationale and  preliminary experimental support for the concept of an association between HLA  alleles and the Ayurvedic tridosha theory of individual prakriti types. This  work is both part of and a catalyst for a wider revolution in the scientific  investigation of Ayurveda in India, referred to as ""Ayurvedic biology"" and  ""AyuGenomics."" Subsequently, Chen et al. (2007) reported a similar study in this  journal using a classification based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)  theory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of a genetic basis for both Ayurvedic and TCM  classifications indicate a commonality between Asia's great medical traditions  in their diagnostic typologies and a genetic basis for Asian traditional  medicine's theory of discrete and discernable groupings of psycho-physiologic  differences. Accordingly, new horizons have opened for collaborative East-East  research and for an individualized approach to disease management and activation  of the full range of human potential, as articulated in Ayurveda and TCM.","According to ""Ayurvedic genomics: establishing a genetic basis for mind-body typologies"", Ayurveda's tridosha theory identifies principles of motion (vata), metabolism (pitta), and structure (kapha) as discrete phenotypic groupings.

How can practicing Ayurveda help manage stress and maintain overall health?,"Recent research on causes of disease and aging has increasingly supported the  importance of stress. One theory of the relationship between stress and disease  is based on the concept of homeostasis, a term coined by Cannon over 50 years  ago to signify those states and mechanisms responsible for the ""staying power of  the body"". Bernard, Cannon, Selye and other leading researchers held that full,  normal function of the self-regulating or homeostatic power of the body  maintains the balanced, integrated condition we recognize as health. Failures in  this capacity, such as those produced by frequent stressful experiences, can  result in disease or death. Theories of health and disease surprisingly similar  to this have existed since ancient times, and in widely different cultures. This  review discusses both the fundamental elements of these theories and the current  neuroendocrine research supporting their validity and immediate relevance. The  connections between ancient and modern knowledge described herein were made  possible largely by the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a scholar and teacher of  the ancient vedic tradition of India. A key part of Ayurveda that has been  obscure to modern science is the substance ""ojas"", which the classical texts say  maintains balance of the physiology. In this article, specific steroids or  steroid classes are proposed as likely candidates for both the ""ordinary"" and  the ""superior"" types of ojas described in Ayurveda. Current evidence for the  functions of these steroids, as well as their role in stress, disease and the  maintenance of health, is reviewed. The knowledge of Ayurveda, as recently  brought to light by Maharishi, includes methods for recovering and maintaining  optimal function of steroidal systems. Such effects may help mediate the  improvements in health and increased longevity attributed to Ayurveda and other  ancient methods.","According to ""Stress, steroids, and 'ojas': neuroendocrine mechanisms and current promise of ancient approaches to disease prevention"", the Ayurvedic remedy for stress-induced diseases and aging revolves around the concept of ""ojas"".

What are the potential health risks of using traditional Ayurvedic remedies?,"An Indian patient referred to Clinica del Lavoro 'L.Devoto' of Milano showed  clinical signs of heavy metal poisoning, possibly related to a sustained 6-month  use of approx. 3 g/day of a traditional preparation (a whitish powder with a  'mineral' appearance) to treat urological problems. To confirm the causal  relationship between the disease and the use of such product, metal testing was  performed on the patient's hair and the ayurvedic remedy samples by total  reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF). For TXRF analysis 1-cm cut of the  patient's hair was directly deposited onto the quartz glass sample carrier, then  10 microl of nitric acid 65% were added and dried in air. TXRF showed high  versatility, rapid and simultaneous element detection, and short analysis time,  thus supporting a wider use in emergency medicine and in forensic analyses.","According to ""Use of total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) for the evaluation of heavy metal poisoning due to the improper use of a traditional ayurvedic drug"", the patient was using a traditional Ayurvedic preparation, a whitish powder with a 'mineral' appearance, at a dosage of approximately 3 grams per day for six months to treat urological problems.

What are some traditional Indian remedies for healing cuts and wounds?,"India has a rich tradition of plant-based knowledge on healthcare. A large  number of plants/plant extracts/decoctions or pastes are equally used by tribals  and folklore traditions in India for treatment of cuts, wounds, and burns. The  present review thus attempts to analyze the ethnobotanical knowledge base for  treatment of cuts and wounds which includes a usage of plants, methods employed  by tribals and folklore practices prevailing in India. Pharmacological reports  available on Indian medicinal plants employing various wound healing models and  its underlying molecular mechanism, wherever available, has also been briefly  reviewed. This pharmacological validation on Indian medicinal plants is very  limited and a large number of plants used in tribal and folklore with enormous  potential have not been validated for their wound healing activity.

"Can Brahmi, an Ayurvedic herb, be used to help treat Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders?","Ayurveda is the medicinal science, dealing with utilization of naturally  available plant products for treatment. A wide variety of neuroprotective herbs  have been reported in Ayurveda. Brahmi, Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic ayurvedic  herb known to be effective in neurological disorders from ancient times.  Numerous approaches including natural and synthetic compounds have been applied  against Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β and Tau are the hallmarks proteins of  several neuronal dysfunctions resulting in Alzheimer's disease.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for age-related hearing loss and tinnitus?,"BACKGROUND: Presbycusis is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both  ears at high frequencies, which affects more than half of the older adults by  the age of 75 years and is often accompanied by tinnitus and cognitive  deterioration. Unfortunately, there are no treatments available to restore  hearing loss. Treatment mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and  communication with hearing aids. Traditional medicine like Ayurveda also  explains ailments of a similar nature as Badhirya and advises using drugs with  antiaging and neuroprotective activity for treatment. In Ayurveda, Badhirya and  Karnanada (senile deafness with tinnitus) are due to vitiation of Vata Dosha.  Treatments such as topical oil pooling (Karnapurana) are usually advised to  counter Vata, improve hearing capacity, and reduce tinnitus. Kshirabala Taila, a  medicated oil formulation prepared with Sida cordifolia Linnaeus, is one of the  most preferred oils for topical oil pooling in such conditions, as it has a  definitive indication for sensory dysfunctions. Drugs like Withania somnifera  (L.) Dunal (Ashwagandha) are also used, as they ameliorate neurodegeneration and  help to improve cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: We propose an exploratory randomized controlled trial study for  evaluating the efficacy of TOPMAC (Topical Oil Pooling with Kshirabala Taila and  Supplementation of Ashwagandha Churna) in tinnitus suppression and hearing and  cognitive function protection in patients aged 60-75 years with mild to moderate  presbycusis. METHODS: A parallel, 2-group, exploratory randomized controlled trial will be  conducted in an Indian Ayurvedic research center at its outpatient service.  Participants (N=60) with mild to moderate presbycusis will be recruited by  screening. Participants will be randomized (computer-generated 1:1) to receive  either basic treatment and health education (BTHE) or BTHE+TOPMAC for 24 weeks.  The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in  the protection of hearing function. The secondary objective is to compare the  efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in tinnitus suppression and cognitive  function protection. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2023. The institutional ethics  committees at National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma  (3/1/2020/NARIP/Tech/2036) and Institute for Communicative and Cognitive Neuro  Sciences (IEC006) approved this study. The first patient was enrolled in  September 2023; 22 participants were enrolled as of August 2024. The data  analysis is yet to start, and the results are expected to be published by  January 2025. CONCLUSIONS: If this exploratory trial is proven effective, it will steer the  setting of a definitive randomized controlled trial to test whether the TOPMAC  intervention can be incorporated as a cost-effective integrative approach for  managing presbycusis. The Indian government has already launched a National  Program for Prevention and Control of Deafness to benefit the deaf population.  TOPMAC may later be considered for integration with the national program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials Registry India CTRI/2023/04/051485;  https://tinyurl.com/2h2hry3n.

This work was performed to assess  the antineoplastic and free radical-scavenging potential of aqueous extract of  panchakola, a polyherbal formulation, in normal and breast cancer cell lines  (i.e., HEK and MCF-7, respectively) using MTT assay. Activities of antioxidant  enzyme, nitric oxide scavenger, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase,  and glutathione peroxidase were assessed in cell lines incubated with and  without panchakola. The outcome was analyzed by spectrophotometer. The results  demonstrated increased cytotoxicity in MCF-7 (IC50 16.446 μg/ml) comparable to  the results obtained with standard anticancer control (curcumin) with IC50  10.265 μg/ml in MCF-7 cell line. Further, the results obtained from antioxidant  assays suggested increased antioxidant activity in MCF-7 cells as compared to  normal HEK cells. The results derived from this study suggested panchakola is a  strong contender in the field of phytomedicines to fight cancer and free  radical-related diseases.","According to 'Panchakola Reduces Oxidative Stress in MCF-7 Breast Cancer and HEK293 Cells', panchakola is an Ayurvedic formulation that demonstrated increased cytotoxicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and antioxidant activity.

What are some potential benefits of Withania somnifera in cancer prevention and treatment?,"Withaferin A (hereafter abbreviated as WA) is a promising anticancer steroidal  lactone abundant in a medicinal plant (Withania somnifera) native to Asia. The  root/leaf extract of Withania somnifera, which belongs to the Solanaceae family,  continues to be included in the Ayurvedic medicine formulations of alternative  medicine practice. Numerous chemicals are detectable in the root/leaf extract of  Withania somnifera [e.g., withanolides (WA, withanone, withanolide A, etc.),  alkaloids, sitoindosides, etc.], but the anticancer effect of this medicinal  plant is largely attributed to WA. Anticancer effect of WA was initially  reported in the early 70s in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell model in vitro Since  then, numerous preclinical studies have been performed using cellular and animal  models of different cancers including breast cancer to determine cancer  therapeutic and chemopreventive effects of WA. Chemoprevention, a word first  introduced by Dr. Michael B. Sporn, was intended to impede, arrest, or reverse  carcinogenesis at its earliest stages with pharmacologic agents. This review  succinctly summarizes the published findings on anticancer pharmacology of WA in  breast cancer focusing on pharmacokinetic behavior, in vivo efficacy data in  preclinical models in a therapeutic and chemoprevention settings, and its known  effects on cancer-relevant cellular processes (e.g., growth arrest, apoptosis  induction, autophagy, metabolic adaptation, immune function, etc.) and molecular  targets (e.g., suppression of oncogenes such as estrogen receptor-α, STAT3,  etc.). Potential gaps in knowledge as well as future research directions  essential for clinical development of WA for chemoprevention and/or treatment of  breast cancer are also discussed.","According to 'A Comprehensive Review and Perspective on Anticancer Mechanisms of Withaferin A in Breast Cancer', Withaferin A (WA) is a steroidal lactone found in the medicinal plant Withania somnifera, which is used in Ayurvedic medicine.

What herbs or plants can be used to boost the immune system and counteract the side effects of chemotherapeutic agents?,"BACKGROUND: Constant exposure to various stressors, such as immune pressure,  rapidly increasing population, deleterious changes in the ecosystem, climate  change, infection with emerging and re-emerging pathogens, and fast-paced  lifestyle, is a critical factor in the globally increasing incidences of  immunocompromising health conditions, as well as stress. Synthetic  chemotherapeutic agents, which are widely available in the commercial market,  may be highly efficacious, but most are immunosuppressive and exert many side  effects. METHODS: Herein, we comprehensively reviewed current literature from various  scientific databases such as Bentham Science, PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier,  Springer, etc. The inclusion/exclusion criteria based on literature with high  importance was adopted to analyze and compile salient information from the  authentic bibliographic sources. RESULTS: Undoubtedly, the pivotal characteristics of immunostimulants and  immunomodulators in the maintenance of the health and productivity of humans, as  well as animals, cannot be overlooked. Numerous herbs used in ethnoveterinary  medicine can be successfully employed as adjuvant rehabilitators to negate the  deleterious effects of chemotherapeutics. The sources of these medicinal  remedies are part of long traditions in different regions of the world, such as  Indian Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, which have been developed  through empirical experience. Traditional medicine employs a holistic approach  to the prevention of disease, and traditional herbal medicines are a source of  many components with a high therapeutic value that are used in modern allopathic  medicine. Globally, many studies have been conducted on these herbs and have  revealed unique active constituents that activate the innate immune system  through the stimulation of macrophages and lymphocytes, and modulation of the  cytokine profile, which leads to a state of alertness with a subsequent  reduction in the incidence of infection. Immunomodulatory constituents with  herbal origins are termed as phytochemicals, including flavonoids, glycosides,  polysaccharides, terpenoids, essential oils, various bitters, and alkaloids; all  these compounds exert vital, multidimensional effects. Efforts have focused on  screening plant preparations to identify adjuvant immune properties;  furthermore, several potent phytol adjuvants have been experimentally proven to  downregulate inflammatory reactions in addition to enhance specific adaptive  responses to vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this review summarizes the current status and future  prospects regarding the immunomodulatory potential of various herbs and plants  and their promising utility for designing and developing effective drugs and  medicines in safeguarding the health of humans, animals, and poultry.","According to ""Herbal Immunomodulators - A Remedial Panacea for Designing and Developing Effective Drugs and Medicines: Current Scenario and Future Prospects"", numerous herbs used in ethnoveterinary medicine can work as adjuvant rehabilitators to counteract the harmful effects of chemotherapeutics.

How can Ayurvedic medicinal plants help manage arthritis symptoms?,"Chronic joint inflammatory disorders like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis, which are manifested by joint dysfunction, show an upsurge in  inflammation and oxidative stress. Although conventional anti-arthritic drugs  are being used to relieve pain from arthritic symptoms, they usually cause  severe side effects. Traditionally used Ayurvedic medicinal plants are a  promising alternative for the management of arthritic symptoms, as they are safe  and effective. Ayurvedic medicinal plants improve arthritic symptoms by reducing  joint tenderness, joint pain, swelling, bone and cartilage damage, and  increasing knee flexion, walking distance and sports activities. These  beneficial effects of Ayurvedic medicinal plants on arthritis are mediated  through various cellular mechanisms including inhibition of the inflammatory  markers NF-κB, cytokines, adipokines, PGE2, NO, iNOS, COX-2, and MMPs and  induction of antioxidant status by decreasing free radicals, lipid peroxidation,  and myeloperoxidase, and increasing antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2, and HO-1. Thus, a  strategy requires using these Ayurvedic medicinal plants to treat arthritis.  This article describes the status of inflammation and oxidative stress in  arthritic conditions. We also provide evidence that Ayurvedic medicinal plants  and their bioactive components are highly effective in improving arthritic  symptoms.","According to ""Inflammation and ROS in arthritis: management by Ayurvedic medicinal plants"", Ayurvedic medicinal plants can be effective in managing arthritic symptoms.

What kind of oral health issues can be treated with Ayurvedic practices?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda, an ancient medical science originating in India, also is  practiced in the United States. The authors conducted a study primarily to  explore the involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in treating oral diseases. METHODS: Eighty-five practitioners participated in this cross-sectional survey.  The authors obtained self-reported data on demographics of the practitioners,  the general and oral health conditions they treated, and the treatment  modalities used. They performed descriptive statistical and logistic regression  analyses by using statistical software. RESULTS: Participants predominantly were female and white or non-Hispanic, as  well as part-time practitioners. Their educational backgrounds ranged from a  5½-year bachelor's degree in Ayurveda to short-term training. Of the 60  respondents who answered the question about treating oral diseases, 25 (42  percent) reported that they did so. Conditions treated were related to oral  malodor, gingival or periodontal disease and toothache. Ayurvedic treatments  administered for these conditions primarily were preventive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic practitioners in the United States treat a variety of  oral diseases by using predominantly preventive traditional care. Ayurvedic  practitioners of Asian origin and those who practiced for a longer duration were  more likely to report that they treated oral diseases. Larger, population-based  studies are needed to understand more fully the current role of Ayurvedic  practitioners in oral health care. Ayurvedic treatment modalities aimed at oral  diseases need to be evaluated through rigorous randomized controlled trials for  safety and effectiveness. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients with limited or no access to oral health care  might seek Ayurvedic treatment, and those who have access to conventional oral  health care might wish to complement it with Ayurvedic treatment. Practitioners  can incorporate preventive Ayurvedic treatments, which are based mainly on  natural products, into overall preventive care regimens, if proven safe and  effective.","According to ""Involvement of Ayurvedic practitioners in oral health care in the United States"", Ayurvedic practitioners in the US treat a variety of oral diseases, including oral malodor, gingival or periodontal disease and toothache.

What is Suvarna Bhasma and how is it used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat certain diseases?,"Suvarna Bhasma (SB) is a gold particle-based medicine that is used in Ayurved to  treat tuberculosis, arthritis and nervous diseases. Traditionally, the Ayurved  preparation processes of SB do exist, but they are all long, tedious and involve  several steps. Due to this, there is a possibility of bypassing the necessary  Ayurved processes or non-adherence to all steps or use of synthetic gold  particles. Our aim is to characterize 5 commercial SB preparations from 5  different manufacturers. A comparative physicochemical, pharmacokinetic (PK) and  bioaccumulation study was carried out on all the 5 SB preparations. The general  appearance such as color and texture of these 5 samples were different from each  other. The size, shape and gold concentration (from 32-98 wt%) varied among all  the 5 SBs. The accumulation of ionic gold in zebrafish and gold concentration  profiles in rat blood were found to be significantly different for all the 5  SBs. Non-compartmental PK model obtained from the concentration-time profile  showed significant differences in various PK parameters such as peak  concentration (Cmax), half-life (t1/2) and terminal elimination slope (λz) for  all the 5 SB preparations. SB-B showed the highest Cmax (8.55 μg/L), whereas  SB-D showed the lowest Cmax (4.66 μg/L). The dissolution of ionic gold from SBs  in zebrafish tissue after the oral dose had a 5.5-fold difference between the  highest and lowest ionic gold concentrations.

What lifestyle changes can I make according to Ayurveda to help delay the onset of Parkinson's disease if I have a Vata constitution?,"OBJECTIVE: The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, is the oldest  scientifically based system of medicine in the world. According to Ayurvedic  concepts, there are 3 humors or Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The combination  of these Doshas in varying degrees leads to one's constitution, referred to as  Prakruti. Prakruti determines one's physical, physiologic, and mental character  and disease vulnerability. This clinical study was undertaken to determine the  constitutional typing of individuals with known idiopathic Parkinson's disease  (PD) compared with that of nonparkinsonian controls. This study sought to  validate the ancient observation that persons of Vata Prakruti are at risk for  nervous system diseases. PD was used as a test case because the exact cause is  not known. METHODS: Patients with established PD (n=75) and closely related controls with  no known neurologic disease (n=73) were assessed for their Ayurvedic  constitution (Prakruti). An Ayurvedic constitutional assessment form and an  independent Ayurvedic clinical assessment were used in the patients and  controls. RESULTS: The total mean score (±standard deviation) for Vata was 11.0±3.9 in  patients with PD and 6.9±3.0 in controls. This finding was significant  (p<0.0001), indicating that the incidence of PD is highest in those with Vata  Prakruti. The incidence of PD was higher in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gained from this study may be helpful in identifying the  vulnerable population, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing disease  progression or development of treatment-related complications by keeping Vata in  balance through anti-Vata diet and lifestyle changes as prescribed in Ayurveda.","According to 'Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) identifies risk factor of developing Parkinson's disease', individuals with a predominance of the Vata Dosha in their Prakruti, or constitution, are at a higher risk for Parkinson's Disease (PD). This was determined through a clinical study comparing the Ayurvedic constitution of individuals with PD and those without any known neurological disease. The study suggests that maintaining balance in the Vata Dosha through lifestyle changes and an anti-Vata diet as prescribed in Ayurveda could be beneficial in identifying vulnerable populations, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing the progression of the disease."
Can Ayurvedic and Yoga practices be combined with modern medicine to treat lymphedema?,"This paper considers the problem of evaluating multimodal integrative medicine  treatments for complex pathologic conditions. The example is given of evaluation  of highly successful treatments of lymphedema using Ayurvedic and Yoga medicine  practices together with modern medicine. For a framework to evaluate such a  complex intervention, we base our proposal on Consolidated Standards of  Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.","According to ""Evidence-based approaches for the Ayurvedic traditional herbal formulations: toward an Ayurvedic CONSORT model"", Ayurvedic and Yoga medicine practices are used in conjunction with modern medicine to successfully treat lymphedema. The evaluation of this multimodal integrative treatment is based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines."
What are the potential risks of a traditional medicine practitioner prescribing allopathic medicines?,"Recent changes in policies allowing practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga,  Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) to integrate into the  mainstream of healthcare and also allowing practitioners of Ayurveda and  Homoeopathy to perform medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) under the proposed  amendment to the MTP bill have brought crosssystem practice into the limelight.  We evaluate cross-system practice from its legal and ethical perspectives.  Across judgments, the judiciary has held that cross-system practice is a form of  medical negligence; however, it is permitted only in those states where the  concerned governments have authorized it by a general or special order. Further,  though a state government may authorize an alternative medicine doctor to  prescribe allopathic medicines (or vice versa), it does not condone the  prescription of wrong medicines or wrong diagnosis. Courts have also stated that  prescribing allopathic medicines and misrepresenting these as traditional  medicines is an unfair trade practice and not explaining the side-effects of a  prescribed allopathic medicine amounts to medical negligence. Finally, the  Supreme Court has cautioned that employing traditional medical practitioners who  do not possess the required skill and competence to give allopathic treatment in  hospitals and to let an emergency patient be treated by them is gross  negligence. In the event of an unwanted outcome, the responsibility is  completely on the hospital authorities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to  abolish cross-system practice, invest in healthcare, and bring radical changes  in health legislations to make right to healthcare a reality.","The paper ""Ethical and legal issues in cross-system practice in India: Past, present and future"" doesn't provide information on any specific Ayurvedic remedies. However, it does discuss the legal and ethical implications of cross-system practice in healthcare in India, which includes Ayurveda. It mentions that cross-system practice is considered a form of medical negligence unless authorized by the government. It also highlights the issue of misrepresenting allopathic medicines as traditional ones, which is considered unfair trade practice. The paper suggests an urgent need to abolish cross-system practice and invest in healthcare to make right to healthcare a reality."
How can Rasayana therapy help improve the quality of life for patients with advanced cancer?,"Anorexia and cachexia are major clinical problems seen in a large proportion of  patients with advanced cancer. Weight loss has also been identified as an  indicator of poor prognosis in cancer patients. Around 20% of patients with  advanced cancer present mortality from the effects of malnutrition rather than  from cancer itself. Early nutrition intervention has seen to improve outcomes in  cancer patients such as weight gain, treatment tolerance, and improved quality  of life (QoL). Effective therapies for addressing these threatening conditions  are lacking. Pharmacotherapeutic agents such as corticosteroids, megestrol  acetate, and cyproheptadine have several adverse reactions and also lack  satisfactory results. Rasayana therapy is known to prevent loss of body mass and  at the same time help to improve appetite and increase patient's QoL. The  Rasayana compound used by us to prevent cachexia mainly includes swarna sindoor,  Hirak bhasma, and suvarna bhasma. To evaluate benefits of Rasayana therapy on  these variables, we maintain complete documentation of different clinical  variables in all cancer patients. Here, in this observational study, we analyzed  the data collected from a group of stage IV breast cancer patients (n = 30)  receiving Rasayana therapy. Patients were followed at an interval of every 15  days from baseline for 3 months. Furthermore, at each visit, there weight was  recorded on calibrated digital weight balance. QoL in these patients was  recorded at quarterly interval using functional assessment of cancer therapies  questionnaire. It was seen that in the duration of 3 months patients appetite  increased significantly (P = 0.03). Significant weight gain was seen in patients  (P = 0.04). Significant improvement was also seen in QoL especially related to  QoL subdomains of physical wellbeing (P = 0.01), emotional wellbeing (P < 0.04),  and functional wellbeing (P < 0.001). Rasayana therapy was seen to be well  tolerated by all patients.","According to the research paper ""Addressing and targeting earnest condition of advance breast cancer-related anorexia and cachexia through Rasayana therapy"", Rasayana therapy can be an effective Ayurvedic remedy for advanced cancer patients suffering from anorexia and cachexia. The Rasayana compound used in this therapy primarily includes Swarna Sindoor, Hirak Bhasma, and Suvarna Bhasma. The therapy was seen to significantly improve the patient's appetite and lead to weight gain. It also improved quality of life, particularly in the areas of physical wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and functional wellbeing. The therapy was well-tolerated by all patients involved in the study."
Can the principles of Ayurveda help predict disease predisposition?,"BACKGROUND: Ayurveda is an ancient system of personalized medicine documented  and practiced in India since 1500 B.C. According to this system an individual's  basic constitution to a large extent determines predisposition and prognosis to  diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime. Ayurveda describes seven  broad constitution types (Prakritis) each with a varying degree of  predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting  types, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of  modern predictive medicine, efforts are being directed towards capturing disease  phenotypes with greater precision for successful identification of markers for  prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the different  constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates. METHODS: Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types  were identified following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian  population of Indo-European origin. The peripheral blood samples of these  individuals were analysed for genome wide expression levels, biochemical and  hematological parameters. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway based analysis was  carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were  significant enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types. RESULTS: Individuals from the three most contrasting constitutional types  exhibit striking differences with respect to biochemical and hematological  parameters and at genome wide expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver  function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological parameters like haemoglobin  exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of genes  showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched  in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent  protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation. A  significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were  observed in these extreme constitution types. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme  constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system  level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease  predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical  phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern  biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise  for future predictive medicine.","According to ""Whole genome expression and biochemical correlates of extreme constitutional types defined in Ayurveda"", Ayurvedic medicine identifies seven broad constitution types (Prakritis), three of which - Vata, Pitta, Kapha - are most vulnerable to diseases. The different Prakritis have distinct molecular correlates, as shown by differences in genome-wide expression levels, biochemical profiles, and hematological parameters among individuals of different Prakritis. The study found significant enrichments of functional categories of genes in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity, immune response, and regulation of blood coagulation among different Prakritis. The study suggests that understanding these genetic differences can help identify disease predispositions and contribute to the development"
How can traditional Chinese medicine improve overall health and well-being over time?,"This paper focuses on the worldview hypotheses and research design approaches  from nonlinear dynamical complex systems (NDS) science that can inform future  studies of whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WS-CAM),  e.g., Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and homeopathy. The worldview  hypotheses that underlie NDS and WS-CAM (contextual, organismic,  interactive-integrative - Pepper, 1942) overlap with each other, but differ  fundamentally from those of biomedicine (formistic, mechanistic). Differing  views on the nature of causality itself lead to different types of study  designs. Biomedical efficacy studies assume a simple direct mechanistic  cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily  outcome, an assumption less relevant to WS-CAM outcomes. WS-CAM practitioners do  not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Rather, they intervene to modulate an  intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and to create a more  favorable environmental context for the emergence of health, e.g., with dietary  changes compatible with the constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system  thereby fosters the emergence of indirect, diffuse, complex effects throughout  the person and the person's interactions with his/her environment. NDS  theory-driven study designs thus have the potential for greater external and  model validity than biomedically driven efficacy studies (e.g., clinical trials)  for evaluating the indirect effects of WS-CAM practices. Potential applications  of NDS analytic techniques to WS-CAM include characterizing different  constitutional types and documenting the evolution and dynamics of whole-person  healing and well-being over time. Furthermore, NDS provides models and methods  for examining interactions across organizational scales, from  genomic/proteomic/metabolomic networks to individuals and social groups.","According to ""Methodological implications of nonlinear dynamical systems models for whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine"", Ayurvedic remedies and other whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WS-CAM) such as traditional Chinese medicine and homeopathy, do not treat symptoms directly. Instead, they aim to modulate an intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and create a more favorable environmental context for the emergence of health. This may be achieved through dietary changes compatible with the individual's constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system fosters the emergence of indirect, complex effects throughout the person and their interactions with their environment. This approach differs from biomedicine's direct cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily outcome."
What Ayurvedic treatments can help reduce acne?,"Eighty-two patients with acne vulgaris were randomised into five groups. Four  different Ayurvedic treatment schedules were given orally for 6 weeks, while one  group received a placebo. Physical and clinical investigations were carried out  at 2 week intervals. A significant reduction in lesion count was observed in  patients receiving Sunder Vati when compared with the placebo and the other  Ayurvedic formulations, which failed to produce any significant difference from  the pretreatment condition. The drug therapies were well tolerated.","According to ""Comparative efficacy of four Ayurvedic formulations in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled clinical evaluation"", Sunder Vati is an effective Ayurvedic treatment for acne vulgaris.

What are some Ayurvedic treatments for hemiplegia?,"INTRODUCTION: Hemiplegia and the Ayurvedic description of ardhanga disease  presents with comparable clinical features. This pilot trial compared two  traditional procedure-based treatments: Navarakizhi, a massage of cooked navara  rice in a medicated hot bolus, and pinda sweda, a similar massage made of a  different type of rice. This article also describes the steps of a double-blind  trial in Ayurveda, which was hitherto considered difficult to perform. METHODS: Eighteen (18) patients suffering from hemiplegia with disease duration  of 6 months to 2 years received treatment with navarakizhi or pinda sweda for 7  days. Both groups received the same Ayurvedic oral medications for 14 days. All  steps of randomization and blinding of procedure-based therapy in Ayurveda are  described. The physiotherapist evaluated muscle tone, muscle strength, tendon  reflexes, range of movement, and balance of functional abilities at baseline, 7  days, and 14 days after starting therapy. Both patient and the assessing  physiotherapist were blinded. RESULTS: Intraquartile range values showed better range in patients who received  navarakizhi than those who received pinda sweda. DISCUSSION: A larger trial is needed to confirm the superiority of navarakizhi  over the rice varieties in treating hemiplegia. This study demonstrates that  double-blind randomized clinical trials are possible in Ayurvedic settings,  ending the long-debated controversy in trial methodology involving  procedure-based traditional medicines.","According to 'Navarakizhi and pinda sweda as muscle-nourishing Ayurveda procedures in hemiplegia: double-blind randomized comparative pilot clinical trial', two traditional Ayurvedic procedures, Navarakizhi and pinda sweda, were used as treatments for patients suffering from hemiplegia.

The trial found that patients who received the Navarakizhi treatment showed better range in their conditions compared to those who received pinda sweda. Both groups also received the same Ayurvedic oral medications for 14 days. The study concludes"
Can the herb Jibanti help reduce stress-related damage in the body?,"The herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl. (family: Orchidaceae), sold as Jibanti in  West Bengal, is used in 'Rasayana therapy' in Ayurveda. Its effect on the  modulation of the two antioxidant enzymes peroxidase and catalase has been  studied in mice liver during 'cold water swim' (CWS) stress using appropriate  controls. The drug, i.e. the aqueous ethanolic extract of the herb (whole plant)  was found to increase peroxidase titre in the hepatic cells of normal mice. But  in the stressed group, the drug displayed no effect on the peroxidase content,  while it elicited an elevation of the catalase content. infinity-Tocoferol was  used as the standard drug. These data suggested that the drug can ameliorate the  peroxidative damage caused in mice by CWS stress.","According to 'Induction of antioxidative enzyme by the ayurvedic herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl. in mice', the herb Desmotrichum fimbriatum Bl., also known as Jibanti, is used in Ayurvedic 'Rasayana therapy'.

How can the AYUSH system contribute to the Universal Health Coverage in India?,"Universal health coverage (UHC) in the Indian context is understood as easily  accessible and affordable health services for all citizens. The Planning  Commission of India constituted a High Level Expert Group (HLEG) in October 2010  for the purpose of drafting the guidelines of UHC. While the primary focus of  UHC is to provide financial protection to all citizens, its delivery requires an  adequate health infrastructure, skilled health human resources, and access to  affordable drugs and technologies so that all people receive the level and  quality of care they are entitled to. This paper attempts to link the ayurveda,  yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH) systems of medicine  with UHC. Here, the AYUSH system refers to the AYUSH workforce, therapeutics and  principles, and their individual role in delivering UHC to the citizens of  India. In outlining the role of AYUSH, the paper lays stress on the 10 guiding  principles of UHC, as proposed by the HLEG. However, as the AYUSH system is not  the principal health service provider in India, the dominant system being that  of allopathic medicine, a few components of UHC may not fit neatly into the  AYUSH system.

Can Ayurvedic treatment help in faster recovery from COVID-19 infection?,"BACKGROUND: Specific treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Outcomes of  clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success. Therefore,  it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against  COVID-19. PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian  Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical  trial. METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide  Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of  Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India.  1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional  herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)  and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in  treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of  tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in  powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30  min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu  taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast.  Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post  randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the  detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of  study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was  used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-α) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day  7 of the study. RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and  placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100 % recovery by day 7,  while it was 60.0 % in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels  of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20  times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40 % absolute  reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in  faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination.

Can Ayurvedic formulations like Guduchi and Madhuyashti enhance longevity and fertility?,"Formulations from the traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, have long been  considered to have potent life-style enhancing effects, possibly by their  effect(s) on key life-history attributes. Although several studies have reported  beneficial effects of these formulations on different components of life  history, few have investigated their concurrent influence on various  life-history traits. Here, we report the results of an investigation showing the  effect of two well-known Ayurvedic formulations, Guduchi and Madhuyashti, on  fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were either grown  (i.e., larval exposure) and/or maintained (i.e., adult exposure) on standard  food supplemented with 0.5% Guduchi or 0.5% Madhuyashti. It was observed that  the longevity of adult flies of both sexes was not affected on feeding  Guduchifood, but fecundity of the females was greatly enhanced. Fecundity was  also found to be affected by the adult food and whether their mates were grown  on Guduchi or normal food. Madhuyashti, on the other hand, significantly reduced  mean longevity and had a stimulatory effect on female fecundity. This fecundity  enhancing effect however seemed to be mediated through its effect on the males.  Interestingly, much of these effects interacted with age in a complex way,  making it difficult to generalize the overall effect of these formulations on  the reproductive output of the flies. Ourstudy underlines the importance of  evaluating the interacting effects of these (and similar) formulations on a  range of life-history traits in a holistic way to understand their utility  better.","According to 'Complex effects of Ayurvedic formulation: Guduchi and Madhuyashti on different components of life history may elude the elixir effect', the Ayurvedic formulations Guduchi and Madhuyashti have distinct effects on fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Guduchi, when added to food, did not affect the longevity of the flies but greatly enhanced the fecundity of female flies. The fecundity was also affected by whether their mates were grown on Guduchi or normal food.

What are some benefits of using herbs and spices in Ayurveda for maintaining health?,"Background: Ayurveda, the traditional Indian therapeutic system, involves herbs  and spices as drug ingredients and a kind of food intake regulation. The health  and curative aspects of plant products are often ascribed to their antimicrobial  and antioxidant activities (AA). However, it seems somewhat possible to  correlate the AA of herbal extracts or plant isolates with their phenolic  contents (PC). Objective: Indian researchers have carried out some tests for the  determination of AA and PC of plant products that are worth mentioning. Methods:  Among the herbal analysis techniques, the important contributions of Indians and  people of Indian origin in this field include the remarkable separation of  phenolic compounds, including the use of reversed-phase columns, on-line HPLC,  the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay to effectively screen and  identify antioxidant compounds from herbal extracts, and other chromatographic,  spectrographic, and spectroscopic techniques, in the analysis of complex  biological matrices. Results: The aim of this paper is to present an overview of  such arguments with reference to herbal drugs and food intake regulation for  specific ailments. Conclusions: The lack of uniformity in the use of test  protocols for antioxidant assays (particularly using the DPPH free radical) and  differences in in vitro mechanisms of antiradical activity and in vivo  metabolism of polyphenols have been the issues associated with these experiments  that have been raised by researchers in the period from 2000 onward.","According to 'Studies on the Determination of Antioxidant Activity and Phenolic Content of Plant Products in India (2000-2017)', Ayurvedic remedies involve the use of herbs and spices due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activities of these plant products could potentially be linked to their phenolic content. Techniques used to analyze these herbal remedies include the separation of phenolic compounds, reversed-phase columns, on-line HPLC, and the DPPH assay for screening and identifying antioxidant compounds from the extracts. However, there has been a lack of uniformity in test protocols and differences in in vitro mechanisms of antiradical activity and in vivo metabolism of polyphenols."
What traditional or alternative treatments are commonly used by cancer patients in Sri Lanka?,"OBJECTIVES: While the introduction of biomedicine within the Sri Lankan  healthcare system has resulted in reduced reliance on traditional, complementary  and alternative medicine (TCAM) over the last century in Sri Lanka, treatment  modalities such as Ayurveda, Sinhala and traditional religious practices still  receive considerable public support. Cancer is an increasing burden in Sri  Lanka, and whilst Sri Lankans are known to use TCAM for everyday ailments, there  has been no research examining the role of TCAM in the context of cancer. The  aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of TCAM use by  cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were obtained from two Sri Lankan hospitals using a consecutive  convenience sample of 500 cancer patients currently receiving biomedical  treatment, over a 10-week period in 2008. RESULTS: Analyses showed that 67.4% of those surveyed used one or more TCAM in  conjunction with biomedicine for cancer treatment. The most common were Sinhala,  Ayurveda and traditional religious practices. Of those patients who used TCAM,  95.0% gave the main reason for usage as 'they thought it would cure their  cancer'. The strongest reason for not using TCAM was on advice from their doctor  (80.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The high use of TCAM amongst cancer patients in Sri Lanka raises  numerous important issues, including those related to patient safety, potential  benefit, interactions with biomedical cancer treatments, and delays in seeking  biomedical cancer care. Further research is needed to explore the  decision-making processes of cancer patients, including the perceived  benefits/limitations of key processes in biomedical and TCAM care.","According to ""The use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine in Sri Lankan cancer care: results from a survey of 500 cancer patients"", a significant number of cancer patients in Sri Lanka use traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) alongside biomedicine for their treatments.

What are some medicinal plants used in Ayurveda for digestive system disorders?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal Plant resources of forest origin are  extensively used in India for various systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani,  Homeopathy, Allopathy, Siddha and Ethnic etc. The tribal communities around the  Kakrajhore forest in West Medinipur district of West Bengal have their own  traditional knowledge based system of curing many diseases using the forest  based plant resources similar to ayurveda. The forest comprises of one of the  unique treasure and rich source of diversified ethno-botanical wealth and  therefore extensive studies is required for proper documentation including  ethnomedicinal knowledge of local tribes. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was initiated with an aim to inventorize the  ayurvedic medicinal plant recourses and explore the traditional knowledge of  tribal people of Kakrajhore forest to treat several diseases along with the  sustainable management and conservation of medicinal plants. METHODS: The information on the medicinal plant resources were gathered through  floristic inventorization with proper sampling method in the study area  (N22°42'57.05″, E86°34'58.02″) during the year 2015. For floristic  inventorization the study area of 312 ha was delineated by using GPS Receiver.  Then total mapped area was divided by virtual grid of 100m apart in both  East-West and North-South direction to allocate 60 sample plots by random  sampling. In addition to inventorization, the use value (UV) of the species was  determined and the informant consensus factor (ICF) was calculated for the  medicinal plants found in the study area based on personal interview. Further  exploration was carried out to establish linkage with Ayurveda. RESULTS: The present survey has identified 57 numbers of ethno-medicinal plants  belonging to 39 families, used for preparing medicinal remedies. The habit of  the plants includes 35% trees, 28% shrubs, 23% herbs and 14% climbers. The most  frequently utilized plant parts were the Roots & Tuber roots (26%), Stem which  includes Bark, Tubers, Bulb, Rhizome, Gum, Wood & Young shoots (24%), Leaves  (18%), Fruits (13%), and Seeds (10%). The most frequent happening ailments are  asthma and bronchitis, constipation and dyspepsia, diarrhea, dysentery, ulcer,  rheumatism, arthritis, fistula and piles troubles. Most of the Plants (88%) had  more than a single therapeutic use. The most important plant species on the  basis of use value were Smilex ovalifolia, Emblica officinalis, Curculigo  orchioides, Croton roxburghii, Asparagus racemosus, Ziziphus nummularia,  Ichnocarpus frutescens, Cisssus adnata, Buettneria herbacea, Litsea glutinosa,  Vernonia anthelmintica and Chlorophytum borivilianum. There was a strong  agreement among the informants related to the usage of the plants (ICF  0.65-0.93). As per the standard literature in Ayurveda, maximum numbers of  documented species (33) are found to be used for 'digestive system disorder'  which is analogous to ethnomedicinal use (30), followed by 'skin related  problem' i.e. 13 and 20 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that people living around Kakrajhore forest area hold  valuable knowledge of the uses of plant resources and some of the ayurvedic  plants represent an important component in local livelihood. Though the  Kakrajhore Forest area is rich in medicinal plant resources but the species are  susceptible to be endangered by intense exploitation by human communities. More  in-depth investigations are required for plants with high UV values on their  possible phytochemical and pharmacological activity. Apart from this,  sustainable management approach and proper conservation strategy for the area is  recommended by involvement of local communities and forest department.","According to ""Inventorization of some ayurvedic plants and their ethnomedicinal use in Kakrajhore forest area of West Bengal"", the Kakrajhore forest in West Bengal is home to 57 ethno-medicinal plants from 39 families.

What should I know about the safety of using Ayurvedic products in the United States?,"OBJECTIVE: Despite a growing body of literature on complementary and alternative  medicine, there is still limited information on the use of Ayurveda in the  United States. Because Ayurveda is one of the world's major traditional medical  systems, knowledge of its use is important. In particular, information on  utilization by Asian Indians living in the United States is needed due to  increased immigration from India and related regions. Recent reports of heavy  metal contamination of some imported Ayurveda products underscore this need. For  this reason, an exploratory survey was conducted. DESIGN: A semistructured 21-item questionnaire was administered using  face-to-face interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study comprised a convenience sample of 64 Asian  Indians living in Northern California. OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included sociodemographic variables,  questions on awareness, knowledge and use of Ayurvedic products or services, use  of other nutritional/herbal products, and reasons for use. RESULTS: In the sample, 95% of the participants were aware of Ayurveda, 78% had  knowledge of Ayurvedic products or treatments, and about 59% had used or were  currently using Ayurveda. Only 18% of those using Ayurveda had informed their  Western medical doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Given its common use in the United States by Asian Indians, its  cultural relevance, potential therapeutic value, and possible safety concerns,  physician and consumer education along with more empirical research is  warranted.","According to ""Exploring the prevalence of Ayurveda use among Asian Indians"", Ayurvedic remedies are commonly used by Asian Indians living in the United States, with about 59% of the surveyed group having used or currently using Ayurveda.

This underscores the need for increased physician and consumer education regarding Ayurveda, along with more empirical research."
What precautions should I take when using non-allopathic Indian medicines for my health concerns?,"Non-allopathic Indian medicines, referred to elsewhere in the world as  complementary and alternative medicine have gathered increasing recognition in  recent years with regard to both treatment options and health hazards. Ayurveda,  Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems.  These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet,  herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as  non-drug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and  by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India,  particularly in rural India, where 70% of the population lives. The difference  between modern medicine and these systems stems from the fact that the knowledge  base of many of the above systems, unlike Western medicine, is based on years of  experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and has been handed down  generations both through word of mouth and treatises. The focus on  non-allopathic systems of medicine in India can be attributed to various causes  including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80% of the  country's population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing  worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific  research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. Elsewhere, the increasing use  of herbal products worldwide and the growth of the herbal product industry has  led to increasing concern regarding their safety. The challenges in these  non-allopathic systems relate to the patient, physician, regulatory authorities,  the abuse/misuse of these medicines, quality and purity issues. Safety  monitoring is mandated by a changing ecological environment, the use of  insecticides, new manufacturing techniques, an as yet unregulated pharmaceutical  industry, the availability of combinations of herbs over the counter and not  mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the need to look at the active  principles of these medicines as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The Indian  traditional medicine industry has come a long way from the times when it was  considered unnecessary to test these formulations prior to use, to the  introduction of Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for the industry.  However, we still have a long way to go. The conflict between the traditional  practitioners and the purists demanding evidence of safety and efficacy needs to  be addressed. There is an urgent need for the practitioners of the allopathic  and non-allopathic systems to work together to optimise the risk-benefit profile  of these medicines.","According to ""The use and safety of non-allopathic Indian medicines"", Ayurveda is the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India, particularly in rural areas.

What types of complementary and alternative medicine are commonly used by pharmacy students?,"AIM: Attitudes and practice concerning complementary and alternative medicine  (CAM) are currently an area of considerable importance. However, little is known  about the overall importance of CAM in groups of health care professionals.  Therefore, the primary objective was to analyse the knowledge about and use of  CAM in an ethnically diverse student population at the London School of  Pharmacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to students (264 completed  questionnaires, response rate: 59.1%) and in-depth interviews were carried out  with a sample of seven students. RESULTS: Forty-three percent reported using at least one type of CAM during the  last 12 months. The types of CAM used that were most frequently mentioned  include aromatherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and medicinal  herbalism. TCM was reported by students of Chinese origin and by students from  other ethnic backgrounds. However, Ayurvedic (Indian) medicine and medicine from  Africa were only used in cultures from which the users originated. The study  shows that a large number of herbal medical products were commonly reported by  students of pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The knowledge about and use of CAM is widespread among this group of  future health care professionals and the students also expressed a strong  interest in the topic. In-depth studies on the knowledge and use of CAM among  other health care professionals and among ethnic minorities are urgently needed  and may help to better manage the treatment of minor disorders as well as  chronic diseases.","According to ""Knowledge and use of complementary and alternative medicine among British undergraduate pharmacy students"", Ayurvedic medicine, a type of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), was used by students from cultures where Ayurveda originated, indicating its cultural specificity.

What are the health benefits of Ashwagandha in Ayurvedic medicine?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera L. (Solanaceae), commonly  known as Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng, is used in Ayurveda (Indian system of  traditional medicine) for vitality, cardio-protection and treating other  ailments, such as neurological disorders, gout, and skin diseases. AIM OF THE REVIEW: We present a critical overview of the information on the  metabolomics of W. somnifera and highlight the significance of the technique for  use in quality control of medicinal products. We have also pointed out the use  of metabolomics to distinguish varieties and to identify best methods of  cultivation, collection, as well as extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relevant information on medicinal value, phytochemical  studies, metabolomics of W. somnifera, and their applications were collected  from a rigorous electronic search through scientific databases, including  Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Structures of selected  metabolites were from the PubChem. RESULTS: The pharmacological activities of W. somnifera were well documented.  Roots are the most important parts of the plant used in Ayurvedic preparations.  Stem and leaves also have a rich content of bioactive phytochemicals like  steroidal lactones, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. Metabolomic studies revealed  that metabolite profiles of W. somnifera depended on plant parts collected and  the developmental stage of the plant, besides the season of sample collection  and geographical location. The levels of withanolides were variable, depending  on the morpho/chemotypes within the species of W. somnifera. Although studies on  W. somnifera were initiated several years ago, the complexity of secondary  metabolites was not realized due to the lack of adequate and fool-proof  technology for phytochemical fingerprinting. Sophistications in chromatography  coupled to mass spectrometry facilitated the discovery of several new  metabolites. Mutually complementary techniques like LC-MS, GC-MS, HPTLC, and NMR  were employed to obtain a comprehensive metabolomic profile. Subsequent data  analyses and searches against spectral databases enabled the annotation of  signals and dereplication of metabolites in several numbers without isolating  them individually. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides a critical update of metabolomic data  and the diverse application of the technique. The identification of parameters  for standardization and quality control of herbal products is essential to  facilitate mandatory checks for the purity of formulation. Such studies would  enable us to identify the best geographical location of plants and the time of  collection. We recommend the use of metabolomic analysis of herbal products  based on W. somnifera for quality control as well as the discovery of novel  bioactive compounds.","According to ""Metabolomics of Withania somnifera (L.)

What types of complementary and alternative medicine could be used for treating high blood pressure?,"OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and  alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with essential hypertension. METHOD: 521 consecutive patients visiting the Hypertension Clinic at the  Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India,  over a 6-month period were interviewed. Information was gathered on the  patients' demographics, type(s) of CAM used, sequence of seeking CAM and  conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons for opting for CAM and  areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM.  Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: It was observed that 63.9% of patients overall used CAM. Ayurveda was  the most commonly used CAM (56.7%), followed by herbal medicines (14.4%). The  most commonly cited reason by patients for using CAM was fear of adverse drug  reactions of conventional medicines (59.0%). However, more than half of the  patients eventually became dissatisfied using CAM. Only 5.4% of CAM users had  informed their medical doctors about the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients receiving conventional  treatment for hypertension also use CAM therapies. A better understanding of the  pattern of CAM use amongst these patients will help dispel prevalent  misconceptions concerning CAM and, at the same time, assist conventional  practitioners to critically evaluate possible gaps or omissions in their own  prescribing habits.","According to ""Prevalence and pattern of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in hypertensive patients of a tertiary care center in India"", a significant proportion of patients receiving conventional treatment for hypertension also use complementary and alternative medicine therapies.

Can Ayurvedic herbal preparations help improve cognitive function and alertness in older adults?,"An ancient system of natural medicine--Maharishi Ayur-Vedic--prescribes certain  herbal formulas to enhance cognitive functioning, prevent illness, and alleviate  the detrimental effects of the aging process. A double-blind study was conducted  to test the effect of an Ayurvedic herbal preparation, Maharishi Amrit Kalash  (MAK), on an age-related alertness task. Forty-eight men over 35 years of age  were randomly assigned to receive MAK tablets or a closely matched placebo twice  daily for six weeks. A visual discrimination task consisted of the  identification of the exact location of a stimulus ""v"" within an array of x  symbols in tachistoscopic presentations. The MAK group improved significantly  more in their performance of this task after three and six weeks of treatment  relative to the placebo group. Performance was highly correlated with age, and  because successful performance apparently requires an unrestricted flow of  homogeneous attention as well as focalized concentration, it is concluded that  MAK may enhance attentional capacity or alertness, and thus reverse some of the  detrimental cognitive effects of aging.","According to ""Influence of a Maharishi Ayur-vedic herbal preparation on age-related visual discrimination"", the Ayurvedic herbal preparation, Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK), can enhance cognitive functioning and potentially reverse some of the detrimental cognitive effects of aging.

What Ayurvedic herbs can help in managing high cholesterol levels?,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of morbidity and  mortality in both developing and developed countries. An underlying cause of IHD  involves retention and deposit of serum lipids in coronary arteries, decreasing  blood flow. Drugs (conventional and herbal) are used to lower levels of serum  cholesterol to help prevent IHD. The Ayurvedic medicine pharmacopoeia identified  herbs that might contribute to a decrease in cholesterol and therefore reduce  the risk of IHD. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted at 3 points: 2003, 2004, and 2007.  Databases searched included PubMed, the National Library of Medicine, the  National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Ovid, and EBSCO  Information Services, and other search strategies also were used. Each article  was assessed for quality by 3 people, and discrepancies were resolved by  arbitration using a fourth person, who also read and scored each article.  Additional assessments of safety using a scale and determination of reported  efficacy/effectiveness of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and  quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) were made. RESULTS: RCTs generally received high quality scores and improved by decade of  publication. More than 50% of garlic, more than 80% of guggul, and 100% of  Arjuna RCTs reported product effectiveness. Safety scores did not improve by  decade. The QEDs received medium and high quality scores, and 93% of them  reported effectiveness. The QEDs had a higher mean score for safety reporting  than the RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies received high quality scores and noted safety  information and reported effectiveness or efficacy in a clear manner. This  finding was not consistent with other systematic reviews that have found the  highest reported efficacy/ effectiveness in studies of poorer quality. Ayurvedic  herbs reviewed here should be considered by physicians when trying to manage  hyperlipidemia in their patients.","According to ""Ayurvedic and collateral herbal treatments for hyperlipidemia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs"", Ayurvedic herbs such as garlic, guggul, and Arjuna have been found effective in lowering levels of serum cholesterol, which helps in preventing Ischemic heart disease (IHD). More than 50% of garlic, over 80% of guggul, and all Arjuna randomized controlled trials reported product effectiveness. Therefore, these Ayurvedic herbs should be considered by physicians when trying to manage hyperlipidemia in their patients."

What are some traditional uses of the Catharanthus roseus plant in treating diseases?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don is a well known  medicinal plant belonging to family Apocynaceae that have been traditionally  used as medicine since ancient times. C. roseus is a well-recognized herbal  medicine due to its anticancer bisindole alkaloids (vinblastine (111),  vincristine (112) and vindesine (121)). In the Ayurvedic system of medicine,  different parts of C. roseus are used in folklore herbal medicine for treatment  of many types of cancer, diabetes, stomach disorders, kidney, liver and  cardiovascular diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main idea behind this communication is to update  comprehensively and analyze critically the traditional applications,  phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and toxicity of various extracts and  isolated compounds from C. roseus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presented data covers scientific works on C. roseus  published across the world between 1967 and 2021 was searched from various  international publishing houses using search engines as well as several  traditional texts like Ayurveda and relevant books. Collected data from  different sources was comprehensively summarized/analyzed for ethnomedicinal  uses, phytochemistry, analytical chemistry, biological activities and toxicity  studies of C. roseus. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: C. roseus has a wide range of applications in the  traditional system of medicine especially in cancer and diabetes. During  phytochemical investigation, total of 344 compounds including monoterpene indole  alkaloids (MIAs) (110), bisindole alkaloids (35), flavonoids (34), phenolic  acids (9) and volatile constituents (156) have been reported in the various  extracts and fractions of different plant parts of C. roseus. The extracts and  isolated compounds of C. roseus have to exhibit many pharmacological activities  such as anticancer/cytotoxic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antioxidant,  larvicidal and pupicidal. The comparative toxicity of extracts and bioactive  compounds investigated in dose dependent manner. The investigation of toxicity  showed that the both extracts and isolated compounds are safe to a certain limit  beyond that they cause adverse effects. CONCLUSION: This review is a comprehensive, critically analyzed summarization of  sufficient baseline information of selected topics in one place undertaken till  date on C. roseus for future works and drug discovery. The phytochemical  investigation including biosynthetic pathways showed that the MIAs and bisindole  alkaloids are major and characteristic class of compounds in this plant. The  present data confirm that the extracts/fractions and their isolated alkaloids  especially vinblastine (111) and vincristine (112) have a potent  anticancer/cytotoxic and antidiabetic property and there is a need for further  study with particular attention to the mechanisms of anticancer activity. In  biosynthesis pathways of alkaloids especially bisindole alkaloids, some enzymes  and rearrangement are unexposed therefore it is required to draw special  attention. It also focuses on attracting the attention of scientific communities  about the widespread biological activities of this species for its better  utilization prospects in the near future.","According to ""Catharanthus roseus (L.)

Can Ayurvedic treatment help slow down the progression of chronic renal failure?,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ayurvedic  treatment on deceleration of the disease progress of nondialysis patients with  stage IV or V chronic renal failure (CRF). Materials and Methods: A complex oral  and proctocolonic Ayurvedic multiherbal medication was administered daily for 1  month to inpatients. Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral  medication for additional 5 months. Four renal function tests (RFTs) were  evaluated at various time points (TPs): (1) 6 months before baseline (TP -6),  (2) at baseline (TP 0), and (3) after completion of 6 months of treatment (TP  +6). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse-Geisser  correction and Friedman's ANOVA by ranks were used to analyze the RFTs. For post  hoc tests, the Bonferroni correction was applied. Bias-corrected effect sizes  (Hedges) for the treatment were calculated. Results: Sixty-four nondialysis CRF  patients with laboratory investigations of the preceding 6 months were included;  12 patients discontinued the treatment. Fifty-two patients with stage IV or V at  baseline completed the study. Mean concentrations of estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and hemoglobin differed significantly  between TPs (eGFR: F = 15.3, p < 0.001; serum creatinine: F = 29.3, p < 0.001;  blood urea: F = 2.0, p = 0.159; hemoglobin: F = 53.9, p < 0.001). Pairwise  comparisons of the mean differences between TPs are significant for eGFR,  creatinine, and hemoglobin. For blood urea, a significant decrease was observed  for the treatment period [15.9(↓) mg/dL, standard error 4.0; n = 52], but a  nonsignificant increase was observed for the pretreatment period [16.2(↑) mg/dL,  standard error 9.8] due to insufficient data for TP -6 (n = 26). The effect  sizes for eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin were medium (0.45, 0.53,  0.44, and 0.30). Conclusions: After 6 months of treatment, statistically and  clinically significant improvements of eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and  hemoglobin and a significant shift to better CRF stages were observed. Several  cardinal symptoms were also significantly reduced. Randomized controlled trials  are warranted to evaluate the effects in comparison to usual care.","According to ""Deceleration of Disease Progress Through Ayurvedic Treatment in Nondialysis Stages IV-V Patients with Chronic Renal Failure: A Quasi-Experimental Clinical Pilot Study with One Group Pre- and Postdesign and Two Premeasurements"", daily administration of an Ayurvedic multiherbal medication - orally and via proctocolonic - for one month, followed by oral medication for an additional five months, led to statistically and clinically significant improvements in non-dialysis patients with stage IV or V chronic renal failure. The improvements were observed in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin levels and a significant shift to better chronic renal failure stages was observed."
What are some traditional healing practices used by Khasi healers in India?,"Despite decades of research on India's plural health care market, the practices  of many local health traditions outside the allopathic and codified traditions  are under-studied. Drawing on interview and observational data, this paper  explores the space in which indigenous traditional Khasi healers in Meghalaya  state, northeast India, practice. Khasi indigenous healers describe themselves  as doktor sla, plant doctors, to distinguish themselves from doktor kot, or book  doctors. This distinction operates as a rhetorical resource, utilised to carve a  distinct sphere of expertise in relation to the allopathic sector, and to mark  claims for the specifically local appropriateness of traditional practices  within a shifting market of state-sponsored provision. Khasi healers are a  heterogeneous group who treat a wide variety of conditions, including physical  ailments which have no obvious correlates in biomedical systems, and  musculoskeletal disorders, with which they have recognised expertise. In  addition to claiming these discrete strengths, healers also present themselves  as accommodating deficiencies in biomedicine, including inherent generic  weaknesses of allopathic care as well as specific local gaps in rural health  care provision. Thus, the expertise niches of traditional healers have evolved  through their interactions with, and the needs of, the community, but also  through managing a shifting boundary with biomedical practitioners, who are  explicitly sceptical of their efficacy, but tacitly accepting of the ways in  which they manage the gaps in biomedical provision. While codified  non-biomedical traditions in India have engaged in universalising  professionalising projects, in this setting at least, non-codified practitioners  have instead utilised discourses of localism.","According to 'Doktor Kot, Doktor Sla - book doctors, plant doctors and the segmentation of the medical market place in Meghalaya, northeast India', Khasi indigenous healers in Meghalaya, India refer to themselves as ""doktor sla"" or plant doctors. These traditional healers use local plant-based treatments to address a range of conditions, including physical ailments that lack clear correlates in biomedicine and musculoskeletal disorders. They are also known for filling gaps in rural health care provision where the allopathic sector may fall short. It's important to note that their expertise has evolved not only from local community needs but also from navigating their practices around skepticism from biomedical practitioners."

What Ayurvedic herbs or treatments can help in managing diabetes?,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and synthesize the evidence on the effect of Ayurvedic  therapies for diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Systematic review of trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a  system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic  treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles  in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching  journals in India were examined, yielding 54 articles reporting the results of  62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and  Eugenia jambolana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush-82 and  D-400 were most often studied. Thirty-five of the studies included came from the  Western literature, 27 from the Indian. Seven were randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) and 10 controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or natural experiments.  Twenty-two studies went on to further analysis based on a set of criteria. Of  these, 10 were RCTs, CCTs, or natural experiments, 12 were case series or cohort  studies. There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil,  fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 have a  glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study. Evidence of effectiveness of  several other herbs is less extensive (C tamala, E jambolana, and Momordica  charantia). CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in the available literature on Ayurvedic  treatment for diabetes. Most studies test herbal therapy. Heterogeneity exists  in the herbs and formulas tested (more than 44 different interventions  identified) and in the method of their preparation. Despite these limitations,  there are sufficient data for several herbs or herbal formulas to warrant  further studies.","According to ""Are Ayurvedic herbs for diabetes effective?"", the most commonly studied Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes are botanical therapies, specifically herbs such as G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and Eugenia jambolana.

What are some symptoms of lead poisoning from Ayurvedic medications?,"INTRODUCTION: Lead poisoning is most commonly caused by occupational exposure.  It presents with a myriad of signs and symptoms ranging from mild anemia to  frank encephalopathy, depending on the blood lead levels as well as the duration  of exposure. Intake of herbal/Ayurvedic medicine may also lead to plumbism as  heavy metals are often incorporated in such medications with the belief that  such metals have medicinal properties. METHODS: We report a case of lead poisoning caused by Ayurvedic medication. The  patient presented with symptoms of intestinal obstruction to the surgical  casualty. RESULTS: The patient presented with symptoms that mimicked intestinal  obstruction. No specific etiology could be determined. Serum lead levels were  determined and diagnosis of lead poisoning ascertained. The lead content of the  medicine was analyzed and it contained 30% w/w lead. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning consequent to intake of  alternative medicine must be kept in mind when a patient presents with vague  complaints.","According to 'Lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic drug presenting as intestinal obstruction: a case report', the intake of certain Ayurvedic medications can potentially lead to lead poisoning, also known as plumbism. This is because heavy metals, like lead, are often incorporated into such medications under the belief that they have medicinal properties. In a reported case, the Ayurvedic medicine in question contained 30% w/w lead, leading to symptoms that mimicked intestinal obstruction in the patient. Thus, the possibility of heavy metal poisoning should be considered when a patient presents with vague complaints after the intake of Ayurvedic or alternative medicines."
Can D. biflorus seeds help prevent kidney stones?,"In vitro effect of D. biflorus seeds on crystallization of calcium phosphate, a  major constituent of kidney stone has been undertaken. There was a marked  decrease in anticalcifying activity with the maturation of seeds or post-harvest  storage for 6 months. The results suggested that the inhibitors of  crystallization present in seed extract of D. biflorus were water soluble, heat  stable, polar, non-tannin and non-protein in nature. There were two or more  different inhibitors of calcium phosphate precipitation since both the dialysate  and the dialysed fractions contained inhibitory activity, though it was more in  the dialysed fractions.

Can tongue cleaning improve my digestive health and oral health-related quality of life?,"OBJECTIVES: The effect of tongue cleaning on digestive power is mentioned in  Ayurvedic information sources. However, no study has yet evaluated this. We  aimed to evaluate the effects of tongue cleaning on digestive power from  Ayurvedic viewpoint, and on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in  healthy adults. DESIGN: Randomized cross-over. INTERVENTIONS: We recruited healthy adults aged 20-60 years. After  randomization, the immediate intervention group started tongue cleaning with a  tongue scraper every morning for 4 weeks, and then waited for 4 weeks. The  delayed intervention group initially waited for 4 weeks, and then started tongue  cleaning in the same way. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the outcomes using the questionnaire on  digestive power from Ayurvedic viewpoint, and the General Oral Health Assessment  Index for OHRQoL. We estimated the effects of tongue cleaning using generalized  estimating equations (GEE). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, by  comparing the changes in outcomes during the first 4 weeks of both groups. RESULTS: Of 58 participants, 57 completed the study. In GEE analysis, tongue  cleaning showed improvement in some components of Ayurvedic digestive power  represented by fecal and body conditions. For example, the odds ratio for  improvement of constipation was 2.80 (95% CI: 1.04-7.58). The General Oral  Health Assessment Index score was significantly increased by 4.33 points (95%  CI: 2.18-6.48) after tongue cleaning. In sensitivity analyses, the trends of the  results were similar to the main GEE analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Tongue cleaning may be an effective method to improve digestive  power and OHRQoL.","According to ""Effects of tongue cleaning on Ayurvedic digestive power and oral health-related quality of life: A randomized cross-over study,"" tongue cleaning with a tongue scraper every morning for 4 weeks may improve some components of Ayurvedic digestive power, including constipation, and significantly increase the General Oral Health Assessment Index score, thereby improving oral health-related quality of life."
Is it safe to use Ayurvedic medicines and what are the potential risks?,"BACKGROUND: Millions worldwide use Ayurvedic (traditional Indian) medicines.  These medications are increasingly associated with lead poisoning, often  accompanied by anemia. We compared the relative hematopoietic toxicity of  Ayurvedic lead poisoning with a common form of occupational lead poisoning. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively studied 66 adult lead intoxications: 43  published Ayurvedic cases identified in published reports by searching MEDLINE  (1966 to November 2005); 4 Ayurvedic patients seen at a referral center; and 19  lead paint intoxications from the same center. We considered patients' age,  gender and blood lead at presentation, and then compared the groups with respect  to hematopoietic parameters. RESULTS: Ayurvedic lead poisoning was associated with higher blood lead  (p<0.001), more basophilic stippling (p<0.001), lower hemoglobin (p<0.001) and  higher protoporphyrin (p<0.001). Multiple regression adjusted for blood lead and  gender found Ayurvedic lead poisoning associated with a 36.2 g/L (95% CI -48.8,  -23.6 g/L) greater decrement in hemoglobin (p<0.001) as compared to  paint-removal poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurvedic poisoning produces greater hematopoietic toxicity than  paint-removal poisoning. Ayurvedic ingestion should be considered in patients  with anemia. Ayurveda users should be screened for lead exposure and strongly  encouraged to discontinue metal-containing remedies.","According to 'Hematopoietic toxicity from lead-containing Ayurvedic medications', Ayurvedic medications are increasingly associated with lead poisoning, which often presents with anemia.

Can the herb Terminalia chebula help improve my digestion?,"Terminalia chebula is a commonly advocated agent in Ayurveda for improving  gastrointestinal motility. Charles Foster rats (150-200 gms of either sex) were  divided into four groups as follows--Group 1 (n = 15) normal animals; Group II  (n = 6) rats administered metoclopramide (1.35 mg/kg); Group III (n = 8) rats  given atropine (0.45 mg/kg). These agents were injected intramuscularly, 30 mins  before the experiment. Rats from Group IV (n = 8) were administered Terminalia  chebula (100 mg/kg/day for 15 days orally). Metoclopramide and atropine have  established prokinetic and antikinetic activities respectively and are therefore  included for comparison. All rats were then given a test meal of methyl  cellulose (1.5%) mixed with phenol red (50 mg/100 ml) orally and gastric  emptying was measured 20 mins later. Gastric emptying of normal rats (Group I)  was found to be 51.6 +/- 7.79%. Metoclopramide significantly increased the  gastric emptying (76.33 +/- 12.37%; p < 0.01) and atropine inhibited the  motility (% gastric emptying being 7.26 +/- 19.76%; p < 0.01). Terminalia  chebula was found to increase the percent gastric emptying (86.57 +/- 6.65%; p <  0.01). Thus from this study it appears that Terminalia chebula can serve as an  useful alternative to prokinetic drugs available today.","According to ""Effect of oral administration of Terminalia chebula on gastric emptying: an experimental study"", Terminalia chebula, a commonly used agent in Ayurvedic medicine, can improve gastrointestinal motility.

What effects might the leaves of A. indica have on male reproductive health?,"The histological and biochemical changes in the caput and cauda epididymis of  albino rat treated with 20, 40 and 60 mg dry powder of the leaves of A. indica  per day for 24 days are reported. In the treated rats, the height of the  epithelium and the diameter of the nucleus in both the regions were reduced. The  lumen of the caput was packed with lymphocytes. Biochemically, a decrease in the  protein content and acid phosphatase activity and an increase in the alkaline  phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were observed in both the  regions. The effect was dose dependent. Further, serum testosterone  concentration in the higher dose treated animals decreased significantly. The  results suggest a possible antiandrogenic property of the leaves of A. indica.","According to ""Changes in epididymal structure and function of albino rat treated with Azadirachta indica leaves"", dry powder made from the leaves of A. indica, also known as Neem, was used as a treatment on albino rats. This treatment resulted in changes in the rats' epididymal structure and function, including a reduction in the height of the epithelium and the diameter of the nucleus in both regions of the epididymis. Biochemically, there was a decrease in protein content and acid phosphatase activity, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activities. The treatment also caused a significant decrease in serum testosterone concentration in the higher dose treated animals."
What steps can be taken to manage the increasing burden of cancer in India?,"This review traces the growing burden of cancer in India from antiquity. We  searched PubMed, Internet Archive, the British Library, and several other  sources for information on cancer in Indian history. Paleopathology studies from  Indus Valley Civilization sites do not reveal any malignancy. Cancer-like  diseases and remedies are mentioned in the ancient Ayurveda and Siddha  manuscripts from India. Cancer was rarely mentioned in the medieval literature  from India. Cancer case reports from India began in the 17th century. Between  1860 and 1910, several audits and cancer case series were published by Indian  Medical Service doctors across India. The landmark study by Nath and Grewal used  autopsy, pathology, and clinical data between 1917 and 1932 from various medical  college hospitals across India to confirm that cancer was a common cause of  death in middle-aged and elderly Indians. India's cancer burden was apparently  low as a result of the short life expectancy of the natives in those times. In  1946, a national committee on health reforms recommended the creation of  sufficient facilities to diagnose and manage the increasing cancer burden in all  Indian states. Trends from the Mumbai population-based cancer registry revealed  a four-fold increase in patients with cancer from 1964 to 2012. Depending on the  epidemiologic transition level, wide interstate variation in cancer burden is  found in India. We conclude that cancer has been recognized in India since  antiquity. India's current burden of a million incident cancers is the result of  an epidemiologic transition, improved cancer diagnostics, and improved cancer  data capture. The increase in cancer in India with wide interstate variations  offers useful insights and important lessons for developing countries in  managing their increasing cancer burdens.","According to ""History of the Growing Burden of Cancer in India: From Antiquity to the 21st Century"", cancer-like diseases and their remedies have been discussed in ancient Ayurveda and Siddha manuscripts from India. The current surge in cancer cases in India is, however, attributed to an epidemiologic transition, improved cancer diagnostics, and better data capture. There are also significant variations in cancer burden across different Indian states."

What natural remedies can be used to treat skin disorders?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The genus Hydnocarpus (Flacourtiaceae) includes  forty species that are spread across the globe. In the Indian System of  Medicine, Hydnocarpus pentandrus (Buch.-Ham.) Oken. is primarily used for  treating leprosy and other skin disorders. It is known as ""Chaulmoogra"" and is  also used to treat other indications including constipation, inflammation, blood  disorders, and worm infestations. Various species of Hydnocarpus are also used  in traditional medicine in China, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar for several  skin disorders. To assess the therapeutic potential of species from the  Hydnocarpus genus and to determine future avenues for research. METHODS: All relevant scientific literature published up to the end of December  2013 was retrieved via a library and electronic search (SciFinder, PubMed,  ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar). Manual searches of traditional books like to  ancient classics, including Vaidya Yoga Ratnavali, Siddha Materia Medica, and  contemporary references including The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India and The  Ayurveda Formulary, were also performed. RESULTS: Seed oil from species of the Hydnocarpus genus is used for medicinal  purposes, predominantly for various skin disorders. This oil is reported to  contain a characteristic class of compounds known as cyclopentenyl fatty acids.  Furthermore, seeds of this genus are reported to contain triglycerides of fatty  acids, sterols, flavonoids, and flavonolignans. Hydnocarpin, a flavonolignan, is  reported to potentiate antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The extracts and  compounds isolated from this plant show a wide spectrum of pharmacological  properties, including antibacterial, antileprotic, antitubercular,  antipsoriatic, antirheumatic, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, anticancer,  anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. The antileprotic activity is  postulated to be due to the cyclopentenyl fatty acids present in the seed oil. CONCLUSION: Flavonolignans have an interesting chemical motif, and hydnocarpin  and its congeners should be investigated for their activities and the mechanism  underlying these activities. Multi-drug-resistant microbes are on the increase,  and the possible inhibitory effect of these compounds when used with current  antimicrobials should also be evaluated. Furthermore, unique cyclopentenyl fatty  acids should also be investigated to understand the exact mechanism of action  underlying antileprotic activity.

Can the bonduc nut be used to help regulate menstrual disorders associated with PCOS?,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Caesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb. [Family: Fabaceae  (Caesalpiniaceae)], known as bonduc nut or fever nut, has been used in India for  many years to treat fever, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular disorder,  cancer and also for birth control. In recent years, the seeds of this plant are  consumed to regulate the menstrual disorders in PCOS. Poly cystic ovary syndrome  (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinological disorders faced by women of  reproductive-age in several countries. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review is aimed at providing the updates on the  potential of Caesalpinia bonducella in treating the major symptoms of PCOS and  also highlights the future research needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the data pertaining to the plant was collected from  multiple databases like Google, Science Direct, Springer, PubMed, Reaxys, Sci  Finder, Wiley Online library and Taylor and Francis without any language  restrictions. Moreover, information related to PCOS treatment was obtained from  native medicine practitioners and from Ayurvedic pharmacopeia of India. RESULTS: More than 50 compounds have been identified in the seed kernels of C.  bonducella so far. Seed kernel extracts rich in active compounds like  bonducellin, caesalpinin, cassane furanoditerpenes, terpernoids, flavonoids and  sterols are studied for their anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-cancer,  anti-pyretic, and anti-oxidant properties. Recent literature has also attributed  anti-androgenic and anti-estrogenic potential to this plant which might be  helpful in regulating hyperandrogenism, the major predisposing factor  contributing to various other clinical symptoms of PCOS. CONCLUSION: Phytochemicals in C. bonducella are effective against several  ailments attributed to PCOS. However, there are no experiments done in PCOS  animal models to claim the direct application of C. bonducella in PCOS  treatment. Hence, further dose dependent toxicity studies are warranted in  animal PCOS models and in PCOS patients to support the traditional evidence of  the plants' potential to treat PCOS.","According to 'Caesalpinia bonduc (L.)

"Can Saraswataristam, an Ayurvedic preparation, be used as a natural treatment for epilepsy?","Ayurvedic preparations achieved paramount importance in contemporary life owing  to the safety and efficacy when compared with those of synthetic drugs. But due  to lack of proper standardization at each stage from starting to culmination  results in inferior quality and less demand. Saraswataristam, a fermented  ayurvedic preparation, has been employed for treating central nervous system  disorders and dermatological problems. Saraswataristam, containing Centella  asiatica (L) urban (Umbelliferae) as the major ingredient is prepared as per the  Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeial specifications, characterized and standardized for  determining the quality, safety and efficacy of herbs used in it.  Saraswataristam was prepared and subjected to phytochemical screening by FTIR  analysis and HPTLC fingerprinting, heavy metal determination by AAS,  determination of alcohol content, test for E. coli, S. aureus, aerobic bacteria,  yeasts and mould, oral toxicity studies and anti-epileptic activity by MES  method.

Can Triphala help protect against radiation damage?,"Ayurveda is a holistic medical system of traditional medicine, and Triphala is  one of the most popular formulations in Ayurveda. Triphala is composed of three  kinds of herb, Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellirica, and Emblica  officinalis. Since Triphala is shown to exhibit a protective activity against  ionizing radiation in mice, we investigated its activity in HeLa cells. We found  that Triphala showed the protective effects against X-radiation and bleomycin,  both of which generate DNA strand breaks, in HeLa cells. Further, Triphala  efficiently eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HeLa cells. Thus, the  antioxidant activity of Triphala would likely play a role in its protective  actions against X-radiation and bleomycin because both agents damage DNA through  the generation of ROS. These observations suggested that the radioprotective  activity of Triphala can be, at least partly, studied with the cells cultured in  vitro. The simple bioassay system with human cultured cells would facilitate the  understanding of the molecular basis for the beneficial effects of Triphala.","According to ""Triphala, a formulation of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, shows protective effect against X-radiation in HeLa cells"", Triphala, a popular Ayurvedic formulation, has been found to have protective effects against X-radiation and bleomycin, both of which generate DNA strand breaks, in HeLa cells. This suggests that Triphala can potentially protect against radiation-induced damage. Additionally, Triphala is capable of efficiently eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these cells, indicating its antioxidant activity. This antioxidant activity is likely to play a role in Triphala's protective actions against DNA-damaging agents, as they generate ROS."
"What are some ways to ensure the quality and authenticity of Ayurvedic medicines I buy, like Arjuna churna?","Because Ayurvedic herbal preparations contain a myriad of compounds in complex  matrixes, it is difficult to establish quality control standards for raw  materials and to standardize finished Ayurvedic drugs. A novel, accurate, and  valid fingerprint method was developed using HPLC for quality control of a  traditional Ayurvedic Arjuna churna formulation, which is used as a cardiotonic  drug. Comprehensive comparison of chromatograms of standardized formulation of  Arjuna churna and marketed formulations revealed eight characteristic peaks in  chromatograms, which unambiguously confirmed the presence of authentic raw  material used in the formulation on the basis of their retention time values and  UV data. An HPLC fingerprint was also developed for total sapogenins present in  Terminalia arjuna. The six common peaks observed in chromatograms of isolated  sapogenins, standardized formulations, and marketed formulations can serve as a  quality control tool for qualitative estimation of total saponin glycosides  present in an Arjuna churna formulation.","According to 'High-performance liquid chromatographic fingerprint for quality control of Terminalia arjuna containing Ayurvedic churna formulation', the Ayurvedic remedy Arjuna churna, commonly used as a cardiotonic drug, was studied for quality control purposes.

What factors should I consider when choosing a therapy for mental health issues?,"This paper considers the significance of the positive and negative aesthetic  qualities of different therapies--in other words, how ""pleasant"" (a term that is  elaborated in the paper) it is to undergo various treatments. Interviews were  conducted with patients undergoing three forms of healing for mental illness and  related problems in the state of Kerala in southern India--ayurvedic  (indigenous) psychiatry, allopathic (biomedical) psychiatry, and religious  healing. Informants revealed concerns about the aesthetic process of therapy,  reporting adverse reactions to allopathic treatments and in some cases asserting  that they enjoyed ayurvedic procedures. Some informants with long-term illnesses  had chosen to live in the process of therapy and reside indefinitely in the  aesthetically engaging environment of a mosque, temple, or church after pursuing  medical therapies for years. Thus considerations of the quality of the process  of therapy also call for an examination of the limitations of the concept of  ""cure"" for describing what is accomplished in healing in some therapeutic  settings.","According to 'The importance of a pleasant process of treatment: lessons on healing from South India', patients undergoing ayurvedic psychiatry for mental illness and related problems in Kerala, India, reported enjoying the process of therapy. Some patients with long-term illnesses even chose to live indefinitely in therapeutic environments such as mosques, temples, or churches after years of medical therapies. This indicates the significance of the positive aesthetic qualities or the 'pleasantness' of the therapy process in Ayurvedic treatment."
How can Ayurvedic medicine be used in cancer treatment and prevention?,"Cancer is a hyperproliferative disorder that involves transformation,  dysregulation of apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and  metastasis. Extensive research during the last 30 years has revealed much about  the biology of cancer. Drugs used to treat most cancers are those that can block  cell signalling, including growth factor signalling (e.g., epidermal growth  factor); prostaglandin production (e.g., COX-2); inflammation (e.g.,  inflammatory cytokines: NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, chemokines); drug resistance  gene products (e.g., multi-drug resistance); cell cycle proteins (e.g., cyclin  D1 and cyclin E); angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor);  invasion (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases); antiapoptosis (e.g., bcl-2,  bcl-X(L), XIAP, survivin, FLIP); and cellular proliferation (e.g., c-myc, AP-1,  growth factors). Numerous reports have suggested that Ayurvedic plants and their  components mediate their effects by modulating several of these recently  identified therapeutic targets. However, Ayurvedic medicine requires rediscovery  in light of our current knowledge of allopathic (modern) medicine. The focus of  this review is to elucidate the Ayurvedic concept of cancer, including its  classification, causes, pathogenesis and prevention; surgical removal of  tumours; herbal remedies; dietary modifications; and spiritual treatments.","According to 'From traditional Ayurvedic medicine to modern medicine: identification of therapeutic targets for suppression of inflammation and cancer', Ayurvedic plants and their components can modulate several therapeutic targets in the treatment of cancer. This involves the regulation of cell signalling, prostaglandin production, inflammation, drug resistance gene products, cell cycle proteins, angiogenesis, invasion, antiapoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Additionally, Ayurvedic treatments for cancer can include surgical removal of tumors, herbal remedies, dietary modifications, and spiritual treatments. However, these Ayurvedic remedies require further research and rediscovery in light of modern medicine."
"What are some benefits of the Rasayana herb, Chlorophytum borivilianum, for promoting overall health and slowing the aging process?","The traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, provides insights and practical  solutions towards a healthy life style. Rasayana is a branch of Ayurveda known  for preserving and promoting health, enhancing the quality of life and delaying  the aging process. In the traditional knowledge, the Rasayana herb, Chlorophytum  borivilianum (C. borivilanum) is regarded as a general health promoting tonic  that delays aging and increases lifespan, cognitive function and physical  strength. Aging is a complex and multifactorial physiological phenomenon that  manifests itself over a wide range of biological systems, tissues, and  functions. Longevity is an obvious marker of physiological aging. Simple model  systems such as the single-cell budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.  cerevisiae) and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) are widely  used to study the aging process and longevity. Here, we show that a  polysaccharide fraction obtained from C. borivilianum increases the lifespan of  S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, using an automated screening platform  (ChronoscreenTM). Chemical analysis of this extract revealed a low molecular  weight polysaccharide of 1000 Da, predominantly comprising Glu1→6Glu linkage.  This polysaccharide showed significant dose-dependent extension of the median  lifespan of S. cerevisiae by up to 41% and of the median lifespan of C. elegans  by up to 10%. Taking cue from these results and the traditionally described  benefits of Rasayanas on skin rejuvenation, we tested in vitro the  polysaccharide for potential skin benefits. In a keratinocyte culture, we  observed that this polysaccharide increased cell proliferation significantly,  and induced synthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA), a well-known extracellular matrix  component. Furthermore, when added to culture medium of human reconstructed  epidermis, we observed an enhanced production of epidermal markers, e.g. CD44  and HA that are otherwise diminished in aged skin. Together, these results  suggest that in addition to life-span extension of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans,  a polysaccharide from the Rasayana herb, C. borivilianum may have beneficial  effects on skin aging parameters.","According to 'Longevity effect of a polysaccharide from Chlorophytum borivilianum on Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae', the Rasayana herb Chlorophytum borivilianum (C. borivilanum) is known for its health-promoting properties and its ability to delay aging and enhance cognitive function and physical strength.

What are the differences between Ayurvedic and Western medicine in treating common illnesses like colds and back pain?,"In Sri Lanka, as in India, two formally structured systems of medicine exist  side by side. While Western-style biomedicine is believed to be useful,  Ayurvedic medicine is well established and commonly used. Underlying one  explanation for the persistence of such plural medical systems is a functional  theory, suggesting that each system is used for different treatments, diseases,  or for the ideological, linguistic or social characteristics of the physician.  In part, Ayurvedic and Western medicine may persist because their practitioners  provide distinctly different services. We tested part of this functional  explanation by sending trained 'pseudo-patients' to 764 Ayurvedic and allopathic  physicians across Sri Lanka. 'Patients' reported symptoms of common cold,  diarrhea or back pain, and recorded after leaving the clinic many aspects of  history-taking, diagnostic procedures and physician-patient interaction.  Medicines prescribed were later analyzed by a laboratory. We found, basically,  no significant differences between the medical practices of sampled Ayurvedic  and Western-style physicians, with one exception. While both types spend 3-4 min  asking four questions and doing two or three physical examination procedures,  and while both prescribe, overwhelmingly, only Western medicines, the allopathic  physicians give drugs, that, from the point of view of Western medicine, either  'help' or 'harm' and Ayurvedic physicians prescribe 'neutral' medicines. While  we have not directly tested the entire functional explanation we suggest that a  structural explanation of the persistence of two systems of medicine may be more  valid. Ayurvedic and Western medicine continue in Sri Lanka because they, as  institutions, are linked to the social, economic and political structure of the  society. Thus, survival is based, not on what a physician does in his practice  but upon the power of his medical profession to control medical territory.","According to ""Plural medicine in Sri Lanka: do Ayurvedic and Western medical practices differ?"", there are no significant differences between the medical practices of sampled Ayurvedic and Western-style physicians in Sri Lanka. Both types of practitioners spend 3-4 minutes asking about four questions and performing two or three physical examination procedures. However, while both types of physicians mainly prescribe Western medicines, allopathic physicians prescribe drugs that either help or harm from the Western perspective, while Ayurvedic physicians prescribe 'neutral' medicines."
Can traditional Indian herbs like Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera help improve the effectiveness of stem cell therapies?,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells which are  being explored for various clinical applications. Isolation and in-vitro  expansion of MSCs remain important in achieving desired cell number for the  therapy. However, in-vitro proliferation of MSCs is often associated with  senescence and early onset of apoptosis which limits its therapeutic ability and  long term clinical use. Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera are used  widely in Ayurveda: the traditional Indian system of medicine and are reported  to have rejuvenating and anti-aging potential. In the present study, we  investigated the effect of Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera on  proliferation and senescence of wharton's jelly MSCs (WJMSCs) in-vitro. METHODS: WJMSCs were treated in culture medium with Tinospora cordifolia leaf  and Withania somnifera root extracts to examine their effect on proliferation  and senescence properties of WJMSCs. Proliferation of WJMSCs was assayed by cell  count, MTT, BrdU incorporation assay, cell cycle analysis and Ki67 mRNA  expression. Senescence was demonstrated using β-galactosidase senescence assay  and associated mRNA markers. RESULTS: Culture medium supplemented with Tinospora cordifolia leaf and Withania  somnifera root extracts exhibited significant increase in proliferation of  WJMSCs as evidenced by cell count and MTT assay. Cell cycle analysis using  propidium iodide showed increase in G2/M phase and decrease in apoptotic cells.  BrdU incorporation and upregulation of proliferation marker ki67 by RT PCR  showed increased DNA synthesis/proliferation in Tinospora cordifolia and  Withania somnifera extract treated MSCs. Delayed senescence was confirmed by  β-galactosidase senescence assay and down regulation of senescence marker p21. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate for the first time that Tinospora cordifolia  and Withania somnifera extracts support proliferation and inhibit senescence in  WJMSCs making them suitable candidates as supplements for in-vitro expansion  without affecting the cell viability indicating its non-toxic nature.","According to 'Herbal pre-conditioning induces proliferation and delays senescence in Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells', extracts from Tinospora cordifolia leaves and Withania somnifera roots have been found to support the proliferation of Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells (WJMSCs) and delay their senescence. This suggests these extracts could be used as supplements for in-vitro expansion, potentially increasing the therapeutic ability of WJMSCs and extending their clinical use. The research found no negative effect on cell viability, indicating the non-toxic nature of these Ayurvedic remedies."
How can I check for adulteration in medicinal Phellinus samples?,"In the present investigation 16 species of Phellinus and 6 species of  Hymenochaete (collected as an adulterant) were screened for sesquiterpenoids and  triterpenoids. A total of 11 spots were detected in both sesquiterpenoids and  triterpenoids chromatograms. The terpenoids were not identified. The spots  obtained for Phellinus were compared with the spots of Hymenochaete. It was  revealed from the SAB and D values that almost half of the species of Phellinus  have about 45% to 57% dissimilarity in case of sesquiterpenoids and 50% to 60%  dissimilarity with the triterpenoids. However, since both the taxa are from the  same family, the spots that were common may be characteristic of the family.  Such a study may be used to reveal the adulteration in medicinal Phellinus  samples.","According to 'Qualitative estimation of sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids of some Phansomba (Indian Medicinal Phellinus spp.) samples and its adulterant Hymenochaete species', the Phellinus species, used in Ayurvedic medicine, and its adulterant Hymenochaete were analyzed for sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids content. The study found that almost half of the Phellinus species have about 45% to 57% dissimilarity in case of sesquiterpenoids and 50% to 60% dissimilarity with the triterpenoids.

Recent research revealed  that this condition is perhaps well known for centuries before him. AIM: This article is intended to examine if ancient Hindu surgeons knew about  congenital megacolon. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sushruta Samhita is an ancient tome of Ayurvedic surgery  compiled by Sushruta (circa 1200-600 bc). Passages of interest were identified  by browsing the authentic English translation of the compendium. Accuracy of  translation was verified by comparing to the original Sanskrit verses with the  help of a Sanskrit scholar. RESULTS: A condition called Baddha Gudodaram, described in the Samhita, closely  resembles Hirschsprung disease. There are indications that ancient Indians even  deciphered the etiology as defective vayu alias vata (nerves). Although the  ailment was considered incurable, a palliative operation has been discussed.  Descriptive details of the operation match with that of sigmoid colostomy. CONCLUSION: Evidence from Sushruta Samhita indicates that Hindu surgeons of  prehistoric India probably had considerable knowledge about Hirschsprung  disease. Further research, corroborating other sources of evidence, is required  to confirm this claim.","According to ""Knowledge of ancient Hindu surgeons on Hirschsprung disease: evidence from Sushruta Samhita of circa 1200-600 BC"", the ancient Ayurvedic text, the Sushruta Samhita, describes a condition called Baddha Gudodaram that closely resembles Hirschsprung disease.

Can an Ayurvedic compound like Muktashukti bhasma help reduce inflammation in the body?,"Muktashukti bhasma (MSB), an Ayurvedic compound, consisting of pearl, Aloe vera  and vinegar, inhibited acute and subacute inflammation in albino rats as induced  by subplanter injection of carrageenan, histamine, 5-HT, nystatin and  subcutaneous implant of cotton pellets. In all the test procedures the  antiinflammatory response of 1000 mg/kg MSB was comparable to the response  observed with 300 mg/kg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Oral premedication with MSB  delayed castor oil-induced diarrhoea in rats, indicating its prostaglandin  inhibitory activity. The antiinflammatory activity of the compound is attributed  to its ability to cause inhibition of prostaglandins, histamine and 5-HT and  also by stabilization of the lysosomal membranes. The antiinflammatory activity  of MSB seems one third to half as potent as ASA.","According to ""Antiinflammatory activity of Muktashukti bhasma"", the Ayurvedic remedy Muktashukti bhasma (MSB), which is composed of pearl, Aloe vera, and vinegar, can inhibit acute and subacute inflammation.

What can be done to address the overuse of antibiotics in treating perceived reproductive tract infections in South Asian women?,"Among women in South Asia, the complaint of vaginal discharge (often called  leukorrhea) is extraordinarily common. From a biomedical perspective, this  symptom suggests that reproductive tract infection (RTI) is prevalent in the  subcontinent; however, several recent studies provide evidence that the  prevalence of RTI is relatively low. Women who do not have RTI frequently report  the symptom of vaginal discharge. An anthropological perspective on the cultural  meanings of leukorrhea can shed light on this puzzling phenomenon. According to  Ayurvedic concepts of health and illness, genital secretions are considered a  highly purified form of dhatu, or bodily substance, and loss of this precious  substance is thought to result in progressive weakness or even death. Many South  Asian women who complain of vaginal discharge also report a variety of somatic  symptoms such as dizziness, backache and weakness. The link between unexplained  gynaecological symptoms and mental health concerns has been explored by both  psychiatrists and anthropologists in South Asia. Leukorrhea may represent a  culturally shaped ""bodily idiom of distress"", in which concerns about loss of  genital secretions reflect wider issues of social stress. Problems may arise  when a symptom with deep cultural meaning is interpreted in a purely biomedical  framework. In the syndromic approach to the treatment of sexually transmitted  infections (STIs), health workers are trained to treat women presumptively based  on history and a risk assessment, but without clinical or laboratory  confirmation of infection. A recent evaluation of this approach demonstrates  that many women who complain of vaginal discharge do not have RTI, and are  inappropriately treated with antibiotics. It seems likely that women are  over-reporting vaginal discharge because of its deep cultural meanings, meanings  that need to be understood within an anthropological rather than biomedical  framework.","According to ""Cultural and biomedical meanings of the complaint of leukorrhea in South Asian women"", the Ayurvedic perspective views genital secretions as a highly purified form of dhatu, or bodily substance. The loss of this substance is believed to result in progressive weakness or even death. This cultural belief may lead to over-reporting of symptoms such as vaginal discharge, even in the absence of reproductive tract infections, due to the associated social stress and fear of weakness."

Many Siddha practitioners in the southern parts of India  prescribe rasagenthi lehyam (RL) as a drug for cancer. RL contains 38 different  botanicals, many of which have been shown to possess therapeutic efficacy, and 8  inorganic compounds, all prepared into a paste in a palm sugar and hen's egg  base. The efficacy of RL in killing prostate cancer cells in vitro was  investigated in this study to determine whether RL could be recommended as a CAM  for prostate cancer. METHODS: In order to scientifically validate the anticancer activity of RL on  prostate cancer, a methanolic extract of RL was serially extracted with four  organic solvents, and the extracts were tested for clonogenic inhibition and  induction of apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, with and without  irradiation. n-Hexane, ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of RL effectively  killed PC-3 cells. RESULTS: The IC(50) values of n-hexane, ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of  RL were 3.84 microg/ml, 3.68 microg/ml and 75 ng/ml, respectively. All three  extracts induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Further, all the three extracts when  combined with radiation, caused enhanced effect on killing of PC-3 cells. Among  the three extracts, the chloroform extract showed the most significant  radiation-sensitizing effect. CONCLUSION: RL, either in its original formulation prepared under strict quality  control or its chloroform extract, could potentially be an alternative medicine  for prostate cancer, and also a sensitizing agent in the context of radiation  therapy for prostate cancer, as a complementary medicine. A more directed study  could lead to the identification of the active principle(s) in the chloroform  extract of RL for use in prostate cancer therapy.","According to ""Rasagenthi lehyam (RL) a novel complementary and alternative medicine for prostate cancer"", the Ayurvedic remedy, Rasagenthi lehyam (RL), which contains 38 different botanicals and 8 inorganic compounds, has been found to be effective in killing prostate cancer cells. In particular, the chloroform extract of RL has been identified as having the most significant radiation-sensitizing effect, making it a potential alternative or complementary medicine for prostate cancer treatment, particularly in the context of radiation therapy."
Can Paccai eruvai nanogel help in improving the healing process of wounds?,"BACKGROUND: Paccai eruvai formulation has been widely used in traditional Siddha  practice to treat ulcerous wounds due to the content of potentially active  compounds. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the enhancement potency of wound  healing of nanogels containing Paccai eruvai in an incision and excision wound  models. METHODS: Paccai eruvai nanogel was synthesized using the high-energy milling  method, and characterization and enhancement of the wound healing potential of  Paccai eruvai nanogel were assessed. RESULTS: Reportedly, Paccai eruvai nanogel has been produced successfully and  its chemical properties confirmed, and physical properties characterized. Paccai  eruvai nanogel showed homogeneity, green color, transparency, and an average  size of 19.73 nm. We observed a significant reduction of wound area (p<0.001) in  the Paccai eruvai nanogel-treated rats. The percentage of wound contraction on  the 16th day was higher than the traditional formulation and nitrofurazone  treatment. Notably, a lesser epithelialization period (14.33 days) and higher  hydroxyproline content were observed in the 10% Paccai eruvai nanogel rats. We  found that 10 % Paccai eruvai nanogel treatment increased tensile strength  suggesting a better therapeutic indication. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that Paccai eruvai nanogel  significantly contributes wound healing activities with the enhancement of  collagen synthesis, wound contraction, and wound tensile strength.","According to 'Modernization of a Traditional Siddha Medicine Paccai eruvai into a Novel Nanogel Formulation for the Potent Wound Healing Activity-A Phyto-Pharmaceutical Approach', the Ayurvedic remedy Paccai eruvai has been successfully synthesized into a nanogel formulation.

Does taking the herbal supplement Trikatu affect how my body processes the medication carbamazepine?,"The effect of single and multiple doses of a herbal preparation Trikatu was  studied on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine in rabbits.  Rabbits (n = 10) were administered a single dose of carbamazepine (80 mg/kg;  p.o.) and after a washout period of 7 days in combination with a single dose of  Trikatu (500 mg/kg; p.o.). In the other study, six rabbits were administered a  single dose of carbamazepine (80 mg/kg; po.) before and after multiple doses of  Trikatu (500 mg/kg x 7d; p.o.). The blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4,  6, 9, 12 and 24 hours after drug administration and assayed for carbamazepine.  In the animals treated with single dose of Trikatu, there was a significant  decrease in T(max) of carbamazepine (P < 0.05). Multiple doses of Trikatu also  shortened the T(max) of carbamazepine although not to statistically significant  level. Our results suggest that the steeper rise and fall in the plasma levels  of carbamazepine brought about by Trikatu, do not constitute significant  advantage.","According to ""EFFECT OF TRIKATU, AN AYURVEDIC PRESCRIPTION ON THE PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF CARBAMAZEPINE IN RABBITS"", the Ayurvedic remedy Trikatu was studied for its effects on the drug carbamazepine in rabbits.

What are some alternative therapies that could help manage symptoms of fibromyalgia?,"This article describes the studies that have been performed evaluating  complementary or alternative medical (CAM) therapies for efficacy and some  adverse events fibromyalgia (FM). There is no permanent cure for FM; therefore,  adequate symptom control should be goal of treatment. Clinicians can choose from  a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities. Unfortunately,  controlled studies of most current treatments have failed to demonstrate  sustained, clinically significant responses. CAM has gained increasing  popularity, particularly among individuals with FM for which traditional  medicine has generally been ineffective. Some herbal and nutritional supplements  (magnesium, S- adenosylmethionine) and massage therapy have the best evidence  for effectiveness with FM. Other CAM therapies such as chlorella, biofeedback,  relaxation have either been evaluated in only one randomised controlled trials  (RCT) with positive results, in multiple RCTs with mixed results (magnet  therapies) or have positive results from studies with methodological flaws  (homeopathy, botanical oils, balneotherapy, anthocyanidins and dietary  modifications). Another CAM therapy such as chiropractic care has neither  well-designed studies nor positive results and is not currently recommended for  FM treatment. Once CAM therapies have been better evaluated for safety and  long-term efficacy in randomised, placebo-controlled trials, they may prove to  be beneficial in treatments for FM. It would then be important to assess studies  assessing cost-benefit analyses comparing conventional therapies and CAM.","According to 'Complementary and alternative medical therapies in fibromyalgia', the Ayurvedic remedies that have shown the best evidence for effectiveness in treating fibromyalgia symptoms include herbal and nutritional supplements such as magnesium and S-adenosylmethionine, and massage therapy.

Are there any risks associated with taking herbal and Ayurvedic medicines regularly?,"Complementary medicines have associated risks which include toxic heavy  metal(loid) and pesticide contamination. The objective of this study was to  examine the speciation and bioavailability of lead (Pb) in selected  complementary medicines. Six herbal and six ayurvedic medicines were analysed  for: (i) total heavy metal(loid) contents including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd),  Pb and mercury (Hg); (ii) speciation of Pb using sequential fractionation and  extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques; and (iii)  bioavailability of Pb using a physiologically-based in vitro extraction test  (PBET). The daily intake of Pb through the uptake of these medicines was  compared with the safety guidelines for Pb. The results indicated that generally  ayurvedic medicines contained higher levels of heavy metal(loid)s than herbal  medicines with the amount of Pb much higher than the other metal(loid)s.  Sequential fractionation indicated that while organic-bound Pb species dominated  the herbal medicines, inorganic-bound Pb species dominated the ayurvedic  medicines. EXAFS data indicated the presence of various Pb species in ayurvedic  medicines. This implies that Pb is derived from plant uptake and inorganic  mineral input in herbal and ayurvedic medicines, respectively. Bioavailability  of Pb was higher in ayurvedic than herbal medicines, indicating that Pb added as  a mineral therapeutic input is more bioavailable than that derived from plant  uptake. There was a positive relationship between soluble Pb fraction and  bioavailability indicating that solubility is an important factor controlling  bioavailability. The daily intake values for Pb as estimated by total and  bioavailable metal(loid) contents are likely to exceed the safe threshold level  in certain ayurvedic medicines. This research demonstrated that Pb toxicity is  likely to result from the regular intake of these medicines which requires  further investigation.","According to 'Speciation and bioavailability of lead in complementary medicines', Ayurvedic medicines generally contain higher levels of heavy metals, including lead, than herbal medicines. The lead in Ayurvedic medicines is mostly inorganic and more bioavailable, meaning it can be absorbed by the body more easily than the organic lead found in herbal medicines. The daily intake of lead from some Ayurvedic medicines could potentially exceed safe threshold levels, indicating a risk of lead toxicity from regular intake."

A fourth  study compared naturopathic care with WS versus psychotherapy by using Beck  Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores as an outcome; BAI scores decreased by 56.5% in  the WS group and decreased 30.5% for psychotherapy (p<0.0001). A fifth study  measured changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores in WS group versus  placebo; there was a 44.0% reduction in PSS scores in the WS group and a 5.5%  reduction in the placebo group (p<0.0001). All studies exhibited unclear or high  risk of bias, and heterogenous design and reporting prevented the possibility of  meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: All five studies concluded that WS intervention resulted in greater  score improvements (significantly in most cases) than placebo in outcomes on  anxiety or stress scales. Current evidence should be received with caution  because of an assortment of study methods and cases of potential bias.","According to ""An alternative treatment for anxiety: a systematic review of human trial results reported for the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)"", the Ayurvedic herb Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety. In three studies, dosages of ashwagandha extract were compared to placebos, with two showing significant benefits over the placebo. Another study showed that using ashwagandha resulted in a 56.5% decrease in Beck Anxiety Inventory scores, a more significant reduction than psychotherapy. Furthermore, a fifth study demonstrated a 44.0% reduction in Perceived Stress Scale scores in"
Can Chyawanprash help slow down the process of skin aging?,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces skin  photoaging (premature skin aging). UV irradiation generates reactive oxygen  species (ROS), which are shown to play a pivotal role in skin photoaging.  Ayurveda is a holistic traditional medical system, and Chyawanprash is one of  the most popular formulations in Ayurveda. Since maintenance of the function and  appearance of skin is important, we examined whether Chyawanprash has a  protective effect on skin photoaging. METHODS: To examine the effect of Chyawanprash on skin photoaging, hairless mice  were administered with Chyawanprash in drinking water for 3 weeks, and then  repeatedly exposed to ultraviolet light B (UVB) irradiation (225 or 450 mJ/cm2)  to induce skin photoaging. To further examine the function of Chyawanprash, its  effects were examined in cells cultured in vitro. Chyawanprash was added in  culture medium, and examined for the effect on the growth of human  keratinocytes, and for the ability to eliminate ROS which generated by paraquat  (50 μmol/L) in HeLa cells. RESULTS: UVB irradiation caused symptoms such as rough skin, erythema, and edema  on the skin in hairless mice, but administration of Chyawanprash relieved these  symptoms. Further, Chyawanprash significantly suppressed epidermal thickening, a  typical marker of skin photoaging, in mice. We then analyzed the effect of  Chyawanprash in human cells in culture, and found that Chyawanprash enhanced the  growth of human keratinocytes, and efficiently eliminated ROS, which are  causally involved in skin photoaging, in HeLa cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that Chyawanprash may have beneficial  effects on slowing skin photoaging.","According to 'Chyawanprash, a formulation of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, shows a protective effect on skin photoaging in hairless mice', Chyawanprash, a popular Ayurvedic formulation, has been found to have a protective effect on skin photoaging. When administered to hairless mice, it relieved symptoms of UVB irradiation such as rough skin, erythema, and edema. It also significantly suppressed epidermal thickening, a typical marker of skin photoaging. In human cell cultures, Chyawanprash enhanced the growth of human keratinocytes and efficiently eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are involved in skin photoaging. Therefore, Chyawanprash may be beneficial in slowing"
What are some Ayurvedic treatments for tumor growth?,"Withania somnifera is a medicinal plant used in the treatment of a variety of  ailments in the Ayurvedic system. Alcoholic extract of the root of the plant was  injected(ip) at daily doses of 200 to 1000 mg/kg body wt for 15 days starting  from 24 hr after intradermal inoculation of 5 x 10(5) cells of S-180 in BALB/c  mice. Solid tumor growth was monitored for 100 days. Doses of 400 mg/kg and  above produced complete regression of tumor after an initial growth, the  percentage of complete response (CR) increasing with increasing drug dose. A 55%  CR was obtained at 1000 mg/kg drug administration, but this dose also produced  some mortality among the animals. A significant increase in the volume doubling  time and growth delay was seen when the drug dose was increased from 500 to 750  mg/kg body wt, but further increase in drug dose to 1000 mg/kg did not produce  any significant increase in these responses. Cumulative doses of 7.5 to 10 g at  daily doses of 500 or 750 mg/kg seems to produce a good response in this tumor.","According to 'In vivo growth inhibitory effect of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) on a transplantable mouse tumor, Sarcoma 180', the Ayurvedic medicinal plant Withania somnifera, also known as Ashwagandha, can be used in the treatment of ailments including tumors. The alcoholic extract from the root of the plant was administered at daily doses of 200 to 1000 mg/kg body weight for a period of 15 days. Doses of 400 mg/kg and above produced complete regression of the tumor after initial growth. However, a dose of 1000 mg/kg also resulted in some animal mortality. A significant increase in volume doubling time and growth delay was observed at"
