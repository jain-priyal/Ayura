Epigenetics refers to the external modification of  DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without  changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have  transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are  lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors.  Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti  (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and  indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus,  it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This  correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and  understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of  both sciences in the management of optimal health.

Is there a more holistic approach I could try that might help?\nETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with  complex multi-organ-multi-target crosstalk in the body. Currently, the  theoretical assumptions framing the diabetes management strategies are  reductionist and largely focus on reducing hyperglycemia through targeted  molecular drugs. While they effectively reduce hyperglycemia, they are  inadequate to address the multifactorial etiopathology, chronicity and systemic  complications of diabetes. Therefore, a holistic and systemic approach is  essential for its successful management. We hypothesize an integrative diabetes  management strategy, combining holistic principles of diabetes management with  its molecular understandings, would be more appropriate to fill this gap. The  holistic disease management principles of Ayurveda, the Indian system of  medicine, can play a pivotal role in this context. This narrative review  discusses the scope of a trans-disciplinary ' Ayurveda-Biology ' approach for  deepening the holistic understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes as well  as designing novel integrative strategies for managing diabetes and restoring  whole body glucose homeostasis. METHODOLOGY: The article analyses the Ayurveda scheme of diabetes management and  correlates it with the molecular understanding of its pathophysiology and  management. The sources of information used in this article include classical  texts of Ayurveda , medical books, published research articles and scientific  databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science-Direct, etc. RESULTS: While  Ayurveda and modern biomedicine uses different epistemology and ontology for  describing diabetes, both the systems recognize the central role of gut and gut  derived factors in postprandial glucose disposal and whole body glucose  homeostasis. Essentially, the principles of both Ayurveda and modern biomedicine  overlap at a gut centred view of diabetes management; and Gastro-intestinal  mediated glucose disposal , a holistic concept of glucose metabolism, is  emerging as a converging node for designing innovative integrative diabetes  management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: An integrative disease management strategy, combining holistic and  reductionist perspectives of traditional medicine and biology respectively,  would be the prerogative for successful management of diabetes. Creating an '  Ayurveda-Biology' knowledge framework integrating the patient centred holistic  management principles of Ayurveda and the molecular approaches of modern biology  can give better insights into the biology of whole body glucose homeostasis and  offer novel strategies for cost effective, holistic and multi-targeted  management of diabetes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'An 'Ayurveda-Biology' platform for integrative diabetes management', diabetes is a disease that affects many parts of the body and it's more complicated than just having high blood sugar.

The researchers believe that using a holistic approach, which means treating the whole body and not just one problem, could be more beneficial. One way to do this could be through Ayurveda, an Indian system of medicine, which looks at the whole body and not just individual problems.

Most of the historians agree that the  documentation of core Ayurveda literature took place approximately in between  400 BCE and 200 CE, while acknowledging that the roots of its theoretical  framework can be traced back to a much earlier period. For multiple reasons many  significant contributions of Ayurveda literature to various streams of  biological and medical sciences have remained under-recognized while recounting  the historical milestones of development.

Methods We did a  cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics  at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using  a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed  using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed  to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among  them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that  Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations  (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%).

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment compared to  conventional conservative care in patients with knee OA. METHOD: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria knee OA  patients were included in a multicenter randomized, controlled, open-label trial  and treated in 2 hospital clinics and 2 private outpatient clinics in Germany.  Participants received either a multi-modal Ayurvedic treatment or multi-modal  conventional care with 15 treatments over 12 weeks respectively. Primary outcome  was the change on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis  (WOMAC) Index after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales; the  pain disability index and a pain experience scale, numeric rating scales for  pain and sleep quality, quality-of-life and mood, rescue medication use, and  safety issues. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one participants (Ayurveda n\u00a0=\u00a077, conventional care  n\u00a0=\u00a074) were included. Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were  more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95%CI: 52.4;69.6])  than in the conventional group (32.0 [95%CI: 21.4;42.6]) resulting in a  significant between-group difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a clinically relevant  effect size (Cohen's d 0.68 [95% CI:0.35;1.01]).

Subsequently,  the amendment in the drugs and cosmetics Act 1940 was brought in 1964 for  regulation of the drugs in Indian Systems of Medicine (Ayurveda, Unani and  Siddha). Later on the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (Mono-Monograph) Part-I,  Volume I, was published in the year 1989 and the other volumes were published  subsequently in different years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, development and perspectives', India has a comprehensive book called the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API).

It is based on the trisutra, which are the  three aspects of causes, features and therapeutics that are interconnected  through a common organizing principle termed 'tridosha'. Tridosha comprise three  ascertainable physiological entities; vata (kinetic), pitta (metabolic) and  kapha (potential) that are pervasive across systems, work in conjunction with  each other, respond to the external environment and maintain homeostasis. Each  individual is born with a specific proportion of tridosha that are not only  genetically determined but also influenced by the environment during foetal  development. Jointly they determine a person's basic constitution, which is  termed their 'prakriti'. Development and progressi on of different diseases with  their subtypes are thought to depend on the origin and mechanism of perturbation  of the doshas, and the aim of therapeutic practice is to ensure that the doshas  retain their homeostatic state. Similarly, western systems biology epitomized by  translational P4 medicine envisages the integration of multiscalar genetic,  cellular, physiological and environmental networks to predict phenotypic  outcomes of perturbations. In this perspective article, we aim to outline the  shape of a unifying scaffold that may allow the two intellectual traditions to  enhance one another. Specifically, we illustrate how a unique integrative  'Ayurgenomics' approach can be used to integrate the trisutra concept of  Ayurveda with genomics. We observe biochemical and molecular correlates of  prakriti and show how these differ significantly in processes that are linked to  intermediate patho-phenotypes, known to take different course in diseases. We  also observe a significant enr ichment of the highly connected hub genes which  could explain differences in prakriti, focussing on EGLN1, a key oxygen sensor  that differs between prakriti types and is linked to high altitude adaptation.  Integrating our observation with the current literature, we demonstrate how  EGLN1 could qualify as a molecular equivalent of tridosha that can modulate  different phenotypic outcomes, where hypoxia is a cause or a consequence both  during health and diseased states.

Are there any natural treatments, like Ayurvedic therapy, that could help me?\nINTRODUCTION: Neurogenic bladder is a common urological condition among elderly.  It results in incontinence or retention of the urine depending on the synergy of  bladder smooth muscles and urethral sphincter. There can also be a condition  where retention causes overflow incontinence. Retention of urine in this  condition is caused by relative lack of contractility of bladder smooth muscles  in response to the stretch reflex. As a result, there is no urge and therefore  the bladder remains over-distended causing retention of urine. Currently, there  are no absolute ways to deal with such a situation except that the patients are  advised for self-help techniques of regularly evacuating the bladder.  Pharmacotherapy for such condition is not promising. As the patients of  neurogenic bladder are often healthy otherwise (with manageable conditions such  as diabetes), a bladder dysfunction is considered as a disability that they do  not want to share. In this state, any approach that offers a regeneration of  bladder reflex and restoration of its functions is more than one can expect for. METHODS: An elderly male suffering with chronic urinary retention recommended  for indwelling catheterization after the failure of voiding trial following the  possible conventional pharmacotherapy was treated with Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS: There was a complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic  therapy. The changes were stable after 3-month follow-up of the patient.

It has an ancient background of being used  ethnopharmacologically for various body ailments. According to Ayurveda, Unani,  Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Costus roots are recommended for  leukoderma, liver, kidney, blood disorders, Qi stagnation, and tridosha. Root  and powder are used orally with warm water to cure gastric problems, and the  paste is applied to the inflamed area to relieve pain. Root paste is applied on  the skin to cure boils, blisters, and leprosy. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present review is to establish a correlation  among the ethnopharmacological uses and scientific studies conducted on A.  costus with chemical constituents, safety & toxicity data including future  directions for its conservation with higher yield and effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted by studying books, research  papers, and literature in history, agroforestry, phytopharmacology of Himalayan  plants using international databases, publication, Red data book, and reports.  The search engines: Pubmed, Scopus, Wiley Inter-science, Indian Materia Medica,  Science Direct, and referred journals are referenced. RESULTS: The literature collected from databases, journals, websites, and books  mentioned the use of costus roots in local and traditional practices. CITES  included A. costus in a critically endangered category due to lack of cultural  practices and overexploitation from wild. A. costus roots are known since 13th  century for use in ancient Ayurvedic products but the scientific evaluation is  of future research interest. A correlation of traditional uses with scientific  studies has been explored to assess the effect of root powder, extract, oil and  isolated constituents: Costunolids, Saussureamine B and Dehydrocostus lactone  etc. in gastric ulceration and lesions; inhibition of antigen-induced  degranulation, mucin production, number of immune cells, eosinophils, and  expression and secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in asthma.

In spite of being concerned with the same  problem, both rest on different premises: philosophy on highly abstract insights  into the core of the phenomenal world, the atman, which is a priori free from  suffering; and classical (- classical as opposed to modern, westernized -)  medicine on concrete daily manifestations of suffering. Both kinds of occupation  with human suffering implicitly follow a common method, the abstract, i.e.  structural investigation and expression of which we call methodology. This  methodology being explicitly stated in medical texts, we speak of medical  methodology, regardless of the (most probably inanswerable) question in what  branch of knowledge this methodology has been originally developed. The article  is divided into two parts. In the first part, the Buddha's denial of a  transcendent atman is investigated with regard to its implications concerning  the problem of human suffering. Not being able to accept the solution proposed  in the Upanisads, the Buddha conceives a new explanation and solution of the  problem. For that purpose, he explicitly reiterates the medical methodology,  thus attaining a fourfold progressive method which consists in: (1) experience  of suffering, (2) diagnosis, (3) prognosis, (4) solution. In account of this  method's isomorphy to the medical method, Buddhism was regarded as a medical  discipline. The second part of the article is focussed on the third step of the  methodology, the prognosis. According to medical texts, the physician has to  decide in advance whether an illness is curable or not; in the latter case, he  is advised to refrain from treating it. Although this position might be  justified from a pragmatic point of view, it remains unsatisfying when  considered with regard to a categorial system of ethics as it is expounded by  Buddhism.

It is a  longstanding health problem, known to exist since early age of civilization.  Records about symptoms, signs and treatment strategies of urinary stones  diseases are found in the several ancient texts of traditional medicines such as  Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Siddha and Unani. In Ayurveda,  urolithiasis has been considered as one of the eight most troublesome diseases.  Ayurvedic management and cure of urinary stone involves herbal formulas,  alkaline liquids and surgical procedures. Whereas, TCM recommends polyherbal  drugs, acupuncture and mexibustion for treatment of the urinary stones. Among  these therapies, herbal remedies are in practice till today for the treatment  and cure urinary stone diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature about  pathophysiology of urinary stones and antiurolithiatic plants was undertaken  using the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of  Knowledge and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from publications from  all years until Dec., 2015 by combination of the search terms and Boolean  operators; 'urinary stone' OR 'kidney stone' AND 'plant' OR 'medicine' OR  'antiurolithiatic plants'. Outputs were restricted to those completed studies  only published in English. In this review, literatures about plants which are  used as diuretic and/or in treatment urinary tract infections have not also been  considered. The Plant List and Royal Botanical Garden, Kew databases were used  to authenticate botanical names of plants. Books and monographs published in  English were used to collect information about historical records of  antiurolithiatic plants. RESULTS: Recent pharmacological interventions accredited ancient  antiurolithiatic claims to several plants and their formulations. The majority  of antiurolithiatic plants were found to either dissolve the stones or inhibit  the process of urinary stone formation. Plants such as Phyllanthus niruri L. and  Elymus repens (L.) Gould, as well as herbal products including 'Wu-Ling-San'  formula, 'Cystone' and 'Herbmed' have been proved their utility as promising  antiurolithiatic medicines in the different phases of clinical trials. In  addition, some of the isolated phytochemicals such as berberine, lupeol, khelin,  visnagin, 7-hydroxy-2',4',5'-trimethoxyisoflavone and  7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone were reported to have potent antiurolithiatic  activity. CONCLUSION: In ancient medicinal texts, antiurolithiatic potential has been  ascribed to several plants and their formulations. Present scientific studies  provide scientific evidences for few of these claims however, they are  insufficient to establish many of these plants and herbal formulations as  therapeutic remedies for the treatment and management of urinary stones.

Could using medicated oil like in this Ayurveda treatment help with my symptoms?\nBACKGROUND: Ardita (facial paralysis) is a medical condition that disfigures or  distorts the facial appearance of the sufferer causing facial asymmetry and  malfunction. Ardita patients may benefit from considering alternative treatments  such as Ayurveda, including Taila Nasya (nasal instillation of medicated oil). OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in the treatment of Ardita. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Studies conducted on adult sufferers  (18-70 years) of Ardita (chronic or acute) in any setting were considered.  Studies including participants who were pregnant or suffered allergic rhinitis,  fever, intracranial tumor/hemorrhage and bilateral facial palsy were excluded. INTERVENTION(S)/COMPARATOR(S): Standalone treatment of Nasya (at all dosages and  frequencies) compared to Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic treatments  was considered. Comparisons between different interventions including Taila  Nasya alone, Taila Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic interventions and  Ayurvedic interventions that did not include Taila Nasya were also considered. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Ardita symptoms, including facial distortion,  speech disorders and facial pain, were measured. TYPES OF STUDIES: All quantitative study designs (experimental,  quasi-experimental and observational) were considered. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant studies were identified following a comprehensive  literature search. References provided within these key studies identified  additional resources. Indian universities were also contacted for results of  Ardita studies undertaken in their institutions.A three-step search strategy  aimed to find studies of published and unpublished studies was undertaken.  Studies published in the English language were considered for inclusion,  irrespective of publication date/year. Following an initial limited search of  MEDLINE and CINAHL, the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of  the index terms used to describe each articles were analyzed. From the  identified keywords and index terms, searches were undertaken across all  relevant databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus, Centre  for Review and Dissemination databases, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP),  EMBASE, EBM Reviews, DHARA, Google Scholar, MedNar and ProQuest Dissertations.  Finally, reference lists of identified theses and articles were searched for  additional studies. Universities and website operators related to Ayurvedic  research in India were contacted, including the National Institute of Ayurveda  for relevant studies. Besides this, the University of Adelaide librarian was  contacted to retrieve those studies identified in the reference lists of theses  and articles. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were critically assessed by the review author  and a secondary reviewer prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized  critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted by the primary reviewer using the  standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Different interventions and comparators across studies precluded  meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Only two pseudo randomized studies with a small number of participants  met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study with 20  participants, divided equally into two groups compared the effectiveness of two  nasal instillations in alleviating four Ardita symptoms. The second study of 15  participants each in two groups compared the effectiveness of nasal instillation  with placement of medicated oil on the head on seven Ardita symptoms.  Observational measurements of Ardita symptoms were graded as Mild, Moderate or  Marked at baseline and after one month. The study conducted on 30 participants  using Nasya intervention showed participants had better relief from the symptoms  of facial pain, speech disorder and earache within the range of 78.2% to 90.9%,  graded as Marked. Along with statistical data available in the studies, this  review found low levels of evidence favoring Taila Nasya intervention. The  review did not include any studies examining effectiveness of Nasya compared to  conventional treatment for Ardita. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents extremely limited evidence from only two small  experimental studies that administration of Nasya oil alone may provide some  relief from Ardita symptoms of facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to  shut eyelids/upward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. No  strong conclusions may be drawn from the evidence included in the review due to  the limited number of studies, limited number of participants and poor quality  of studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Practitioners should advice Ardita patients that  there is extremely limited evidence suggesting the potential effectiveness of  Nasya oils alone or Nasya in conjunction with other Ayurvedic treatments in  managing symptoms. However, given the absence of a strong evidence base,  practitioners should be guided by clinical wisdom and patient preference. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Well controlled clinical trials comparing standalone  Nasya therapy to other Ayurvedic treatments and/or conventional medicine for  Ardita symptoms need to be conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of  different Nasya oils in treating Ardita."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'The effectiveness of ayurvedic oil-based nasal instillation (Nasya) medicines in the treatment of facial paralysis (Ardita): a systematic review', using a treatment called Nasya, which involves putting medicated oil in the nose, might help people with Ardita, a condition causing facial paralysis. Some people who tried this in the studies experienced less facial pain, improved speech, and fewer earaches.

However, none of them has been successfully introduced as an adaptogen in the  clinic. This paper discusses some of the problems in evaluation of adaptogens  which have precluded their inclusion as clinically useful drugs.

AIM: The aim of this review is to share the role of Ayurveda's insights,  traditional usage and contemporary investigations for translational, integrative  applications to manage Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High impact journals for Parkinson's diseases,  traditional textbooks from Ayurveda as well as relevant clinical and para  clinical studies with botanicals are selectively incorporated to evolve the  aforesaid translational application. RESULTS: . A. CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING AND EXISTING THERAPEUTIC GAPS: Parkinson's disease  (PD) is a complex multi-system, neurodegenerative disease. Though predominantly  perceived as a motor disease, it also has debilitating non- motor features,  which are frequently missed and not treated. Major treatment goals are to  increase striatal dopamine levels with precursor-substitution and/or reduce its  breakdown. As the disease progresses, a steady increase in the dose of levodopa  is inevitable. However, higher doses cause motor complications of dyskinesia and  dystonia and compromise medical treatment. B. ROLE OF MUCUNA PRURIENS L.DC), THE  MOST PROMISING BOTANICAL FROM AYURVEDA: Ayurveda offers a natural source of  levodopa - the seeds of Mucuna pruriens L.(DC)- which have a long standing safe  use in the condition. Its clinical studies have shown pharmacokinetic profile  distinct from synthetic levodopa, which is likely to reduce the untoward motor  complications. Additionally, its seed extracts have shown neuroprotective  benefits which are unrelated to levodopa. C. AYURVEDIC REGIMENS AND MEDICINAL  PLANTS FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE AND SYMPTOMATIC BENEFITS: Other regimens  (Panchakarma) and medicinal plants used in Ayurveda have been subjected to  exploratory studies with promising early results in the condition. The  debilitating non motor symptoms in patients have shown response with one of the  regimens - medicated oil enema (basti). Effects of two medicinal plants Withania  somnifera(L.)Dunal and Curcuma longa Linn in Parkinson's Disease related models  have been discussed in detail. We have also shared a shortlist of medicinal  plants most likely to be useful in management of specific features of the  disease such as cognitive decline, mood disorders, risk of osteoporosis amongst  others.

Both the systems contributing equally to the primary healthcare in India. The  present study is aimed to understand the current scenario of medicinal practices  of non-codified system of traditional medicine in Belgaum region, India. METHODS: The study has been conducted as a basic survey of identified  non-codified traditional practitioners by convenience sampling with semi  structured, open ended interviews and discussions.

However, the  effective quality control of herbal medicine is still a big challenge. Numerous  reports indicate noncompliance with Compromised Good Manufacturing Practice  (GMP) guidelines by the manufacturers which may lead to adverse drug reactions  or toxic effects. Asava and arishta are the classical herbal dosage forms  wherein fermentation occurs during production leading to the generation of  ethanol. The presence of ethanol in these preparations may lead to their misuse.  The self-generated ethanol is responsible for extraction of active constituents  and acts as a self-preservative. As the procedure for preparation for asava and  arishta is same, the ethanol content is also expected to be the same  irrespective of the manufacturer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess and compare the  ethanol content of some traditionally fermented ayurvedic formulations available  in the market. METHOD: In this study, 20 formulations from 3 different manufacturers available  as over-the-counter products were obtained and their ethanol contents were  determined using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were noted in the ethanol content  of various ayurvedic formulations. A simple, less time-consuming, economic, and  validated gas chromatographic method for estimation of ethanol in fermented  ayurvedic formulations was also developed successfully in present study.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We compile and emphasize the most important part of  ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their  applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review  and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the  pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants  against problem skin diseases as well. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different kinds of key phrases such as \"Indian  traditional ethnodermatology\", \"ethnodermatology\", \"ethnobotany\", \"skin  diseases\", \"Ayurveda dermatology\", \"pharmacological activity\" were searched in  online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar  (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/),  PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository  (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained  from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary  shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants' uses have been found  across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities  of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against  particular skin diseases. RESULTS: The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian  subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin  disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is  topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the  pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice,  bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment  remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This  review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the  belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective  therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical  evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may  contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today,  ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new  practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will  further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of  natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand  for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on  plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be  intensified."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India: From ayurvedic formulations to clinical perspectives - A review', traditional methods of treating skin conditions in India using medicinal plants have shown promise.

How can understanding my Ayurvedic prakriti help improve my gut health?\nAyurveda is one of the ancient systems of medicine which is widely practised as  a personalized scientific approach towards the general wellness. Ayurvedic  prakriti is broadly defined as the phenotypes which are determined on the basis  of physical, psychological and physiological traits irrespective of their  social, ethnic, dietary and geographical stature. Prakriti is the constitution  of a person, which comprises vata, pitta, and kapha and is a key determinant of  how one individual is different from the other.

Prakriti-specific presence of bacterial taxa was recorded and  only 42% microbiome in the oral samples and 52% microbiome in the skin samples  were shared. Bacteria known for preventing gut inflammation by digesting the  resistant starch were abundant in the pitta prakriti individuals, who are more  prone to develop gut-inflammation-related disorders.

Is there a way to check the ingredients in these products?\nINTRODUCTION: Ayurveda takes advantage of the beneficial properties of medicinal  plants. High demands in combination with inadequate availability of botanicals  and a lack of knowledge with respect to their precise identification lead to  adulterations in herbal products. Identification becomes more difficult in  complex herbal formulations. Four different polyherbal formulations have been  analyzed for the present paper. The targeted plants have different  pharmacological properties for various ailments. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the rbcL gene based plant DNA mini-barcode to  identify target and non-target plants in polyherbal formulations by using  high-throughput next generation sequencing. METHODS: Degenerate primers of the selected mini-barcode region have been  identified from the literature. A blend of 30 authentic medicinal plant species  was used to examine the species resolution capacity of the mini-barcode. DNA was  isolated from herbal formulations, an amplicon library was prepared, and  sequencing was performed on an IonS5 system. Data were analyzed using various  bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Analysis of control pooled samples revealed the optimum resolving power  of the DNA mini-barcode. Data analysis of the commercial samples revealed that  only one herbal formulation contained all plants and matched with listed  contents. In two formulations, only 10 out of 21 and 11 out of 20 plants were  detected, respectively. Additionally, several non-listed plants were also  detected in these formulations. Two formulations contained >20% reads assigned  to non-target plants. Overall, 21.98% of the reads were assigned to non-target  plants.

The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita  and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions  and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities,  along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi,  India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before  seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN,  hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was  resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough,  body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based  on the patient's symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including  Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle  modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga  consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms  within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately [Formula:  see text] relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief  within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar [FBS] and  postprandial blood sugar [PPBS]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days,  and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in  symptoms, the patient's real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the  symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a  significant improvement in blood sugar levels (not under control with modern  medicine) was also achieved.

Can you tell me more about it and whether it's safe to use?\nETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shilajit is a multi-component natural occurring  mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine which  originated in India. Its source can be traced to the mountainous regions, where  the hilly tribes first identified its beneficial use. Shilajit is aptly referred  to as 'rasayana'/'rasayanam' in Ayurveda and Siddha literature which means  rejuvenator because it prevents ailment and enhances the quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An attempt has been put forth to review shilajit  pertaining to its origin, synonyms, varieties, physical properties, chemical  constituents, therapeutic properties and important biological properties to  affirm its rasayana property. All relevant information on shilajit was collected  from classical texts including pharmacopoeias, formularies, etc. Moreover,  select doctoral thesis from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Gujarat  Ayurved University, Jamnagar were also scanned. Published papers on shilajit  were collected from important databases for biomedical sciences. Amongst, the  various biological properties of shilajit, antioxidant activity and  immuno-modulatory activity were focused as it is closely related to its rasayana  potential. RESULTS: This review finds that shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations  and twenty-four proprietary drugs for extraneous indications. Even-though, there  is a long history of use of shilajit in traditional Indian materia medica,  shilajit unfortunately lacks scientific evaluation and systematic documentation.  In vivo antioxidant activity of shilajit has been studied at an irrelevant dose  and without using a positive control. The immuno-modulatory activity does not  stand the test of critical assessment and currently may be considered as  unproven. CONCLUSION: Based on the earlier studies, the bioactivity of shilajit lacks  substantial evidence. Nevertheless, further studies are imperative to overcome  the lacuna in establishing the antioxidant property of shilajit and more  specific assays are needed to vouch shilajit as an immuno-modulator which may be  of use to establish its rasayana potential."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Review on shilajit used in traditional Indian medicine', Shilajit is a natural substance found in mountains, often used in Indian traditional medicine for overall health and well-being.

While the pathobiology of PD remains in study, neuroinflammation is  thought to speed nigrostriatal degeneration. The neuroinflammatory cascade  associated with PD begins with aggregation of misfolded or post-translationally  modified \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). Such aggregation results in neuronal cell death  and the presence of chronically activated glia (microglia and astroglia),  leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis  factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and enzymes such as  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2). These changes in the glial phenotype can affect the central nervous  system (CNS) microenvironment by producing a pro-inflammatory milieu that speeds  PD pathogenesis. Mucuna pruriens (Mp) is the most popular drug in Ayurveda, the  Indian system of medicine. Several reports have suggested that it possesses  analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-epileptic and anti-microbial  activities. Mp contain L-DOPA and ursolic acid which has an anti-inflammatory  property. There are very few literatures which show the immunomodulatory  activity of Mp in PD, several researchers have tried to work on the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in some other diseases. The results of several  studies show that Mp modulate the immune components like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03bb,  IL-1\u03b2, iNOS and IL-2 in the CNS. It also modulates the activity of the  transcription factor NF-kB which plays an important role in the progression of  the PD. Thus, by altering these cytokines or transcription factors, Mp protects  or prevents the progression of PD. Thus in this review we try to explore the  immunomodulatory activity of Mp in PD."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Immunomodulation of Parkinson's disease using Mucuna pruriens (Mp)', Parkinson's disease is partly caused by inflammation and damage in certain parts of the brain.

This stands in sharp contrast to mainstream Ayurveda that is  observed to have undergone biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization. This  paper argues that Kerala's classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market  constitutes an alternative modernity because it provided Kerala Ayurveda with a  different route to modernization impervious to the biomedical regime, as well as  endowing it with the institutional power to safeguard its regional identity.  Although physician-entrepreneurs are its key architects, it is sustained by  value regimes shaped by a unique regional medico-cultural milieu. Even when  industrially produced, classical medicines remain embedded within Ayurveda's  socio-technical network; unlike proprietary drugs sold as individual  product-identities through non-Ayurvedic channels, they travel together as a  pharmacopeia, distributed through exclusive doctor-mediated agencies. This  clinic-centric distribution format is best conceptualized as an open-source  business model as it made low-margin generics viable by packaging them with  therapies and services. Besides ensuring better access and affordability, it  provided resistance to pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property  concentration. By keeping the doctor in the loop, it prevented medicines from  degenerating into de-contextualized commodities; the service component of  Ayurveda therein preserved went on become the unique selling point in the  health-tourism market. The tourism-inspired proliferation of Brand Kerala  eventually triggered a paradigm shift in mainstream Ayurveda - shifting focus  from 'pharmaceuticals' to 'services' and from 'illness' to 'wellness'.

The prime focus is  given towards modern as well as alternative systems of medicine such as  phototherapy, a combination of phototherapy with pharmacotherapy such as  Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy to treat  psoriasis. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of 161 papers, including both research and  review articles, was carried out to make the article readily understandable. The  pathogenesis including inflammatory mediators and type of psoriasis is discussed  before the treatment strategies to understand the pathophysiology of the  disease. The uniqueness, procedure, advantages, and limitations of conventional,  advanced, and traditional systems of medicine to treat psoriasis are discussed  in detail. Emphasis has also been given towards marine sources such as fish oil,  marine sponges, and algae. CONCLUSION: Although there are many modern and alternative treatment strategies  available to treat psoriasis, none of them have been proven to provide complete  relief to patients. Moreover, they are associated with certain side effects. In  order to overcome them, novel drug delivery systems have been utilized and found  effective; however, their stability and safety become the major impediments  towards their successful positioning. Traditional and alternative treatment  strategies have found to be safe and effective but their use is localized to  certain areas. In a nutshell, to achieve successful treatment of psoriasis,  there is a need to focus on the development of stable and non-toxic novel drug  delivery systems or the promotion of traditional systems to treat psoriasis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Treatment Strategies Against Psoriasis: Principle, Perspectives and Practices', psoriasis is a kind of skin condition that can cause red, scaly patches which sometimes can be itchy or sore.

How can I be sure that what I'm buying is genuine and not contaminated or mixed with something else?\nINTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased global use  of traditional medicines, including Ayurvedic herbal preparations. Due to their  growing demand, their processed nature, and the complexity of the global supply  chain, there is an increased risk of adulteration in these products. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the use of DNA barcoding  for species identification in herbal supplements on the US market associated  with the Ayurvedic treatment of respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A total of 54 commercial products containing Ayurvedic herbs were  tested with four DNA barcoding regions (i.e., rbcL, matK, ITS2, and mini-ITS2)  using two composite samples per product. Nine categories of herbs were targeted:  amla, ashwagandha, cinnamon, ginger, guduchi, tribulus, tulsi, turmeric, and  vacha. RESULTS: At least one species was identified in 64.8% of products and the  expected species was detected in 38.9% of products. Undeclared plant species,  including other Ayurvedic herbs, rice, and pepper, were detected in 19 products,  and fungal species were identified in 12 products. The presence of undeclared  plant species may be a result of intentional substitution or contamination  during harvest or processing, while fungal DNA was likely associated with the  plant material or the growing environment. The greatest sequencing success  (42.6-46.3%) was obtained with the matK and rbcL primers. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that a combination of genetic  loci should be used for DNA barcoding of herbal supplements. Due to the  limitations of DNA barcoding in identification of these products, future  research should incorporate chemical characterization techniques."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to \"DNA barcoding of herbal supplements on the US commercial market associated with the purported treatment of COVID-19\", researchers found that some herbal medicines being used for COVID-19 treatment might not contain what they claim.

Due to a growing body of research on side effects and  long-term impacts of conventional CVD treatments, focus is shifting towards  exploring alternative treatment approaches such as Ayurveda. However, because of  a lack of strong scientific evidence, the safety and efficacy profiles of such  interventions have not been well established. The current study aims to conduct  a systematic review and meta-analyses to explore the strength of evidence on  efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic herbs for hypercholesterolemia. Methods:  Literature searches were conducted using databases including Medline, Cochrane  Database, AMED, Embase, AYUSH research portal, and many others. All randomized  controlled trials on individuals with hypercholesterolemia using Ayurvedic herbs  (alone or in combination) with an exposure period of \u2265 3 weeks were included,  with primary outcomes being total cholesterol levels, adverse events, and other  cardiovascular events. The search strategy was determined with the help of the  Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group. Two researchers assessed the  risk of each study individually and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or  consultation with a third researcher. Meta-analysis was conducted using the  inverse variance method and results are presented as forest plots and data  summary tables using Revman v5.3. Results: A systematic review of 32 studies  with 1386 participants found randomized controlled trials of three Ayurvedic  herbs, Allium sativum (garlic), Commiphora mukul (guggulu), and Nigella sativa  (black cumin) on hypercholesterolemia that met inclusion criteria.

This study was conducted to determine prevalence of  anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological morbidities among the patients  who received warded treatments at Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Teaching  Hospital, Sri Lanka. METHODS: A total of 148 patients admitted to the hospital were selected for the  study on a random systematic basis under four systemic groups (gastrointestinal,  integumentary, musculoskeletal, and nervous system) depending on the chief  complaint. The presence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms was assessed  by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 item version (DASS 21). The General  Linear Model (GLM) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Over 50% of the participants in all four patient groups belonged to age  group of 35 to 65 years, encompassing the fraction of population that actively  contribute to the workforce in the society. Stress, anxiety, and depression  values of patients belonging to different complications varied significantly, as  indicated by GLM (p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: Isolation of scopoletin from the roots of Argyreia speciosa, and  development and validation of an analytical method using HPLC for the  quantification of scopoletin from the root powder of Argyreia speciosa. METHOD: Scopoletin was isolated from chloroform fraction prepared from  hydrolyzed methanolic extract and identified using spectral studies. A  reverse-phase HPLC-based analytical method was developed and optimized using the  Design of Experiment (DoE) approach to estimate scopoletin from the roots of  Argyreia speciosa. Scopoletin was separated and quantified using HPLC containing  the C18 column and a PDA detector. The optimized mobile phase was methanol:  water (pH\u223c3.2) [25: 75, %v/v]. RESULTS: The Box-Behnken design was used to optimize chromatographic parameters  and the extraction procedure. The validation studies showed a linear  relationship (r2=0.998) in the range of 1-40\u2009\u00b5g/mL.

The concept is claimed to be useful in predicting an  individual's susceptibility to a particular disease, prognosis of that illness  and selection of therapy. The present study was carried out to study if the  platelet aggregatory response and its inhibition by aspirin varied in the  different prakriti subtypes. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee permission, normal  healthy individuals of either sex between the age group 18 to 30 years were  recruited in the study. Their prakriti evaluation was done using a standardized  validated questionnaire (TNMC Prakriti 2004). Their Platelet Rich Plasma was  incubated with either aspirin [2.5 micro-mole (\u03bcM) and 5 \u03bcM] or distilled water  as control for three minutes after which the aggregatory response to 5 \u03bcM  Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) was measured over a period of 7 minutes. RESULTS: We observed that in the study population of normal healthy participants  (n= 137), ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) was highest among the  Vata-pitta prakriti individuals [Median (range), 83.33% (52.33-96)] as compared  to the other prakriti types and these individuals responded better to lower dose  of aspirin compared to other prakriti types.

In recent years, the use of herbal medicines for protection  from other strong antibiotics as well as drugs that can damage the liver during  their metabolism in liver and for treatment of liver diseases has increased all  over the world. It is important to mention that a number of organic solvents are  used at different stages of extraction/formulation development for these  traditional preparations in industries/pharmacies.

There are even mythological stories about the origin of this recipe  including its nomenclature. In the last six decades, CP, because of  entrepreneurial actions of some research Vaidyas (traditional doctors) has grown  to industrial production and marketing in packed forms to a large number of  consumers/patients like any food or health care product.

It  represents an ancient system of traditional medicine prevalent in India and in  several other south Asian countries. It is based on a holistic view of treatment  which is believed to cure human diseases through establishment of equilibrium in  the different elements of human life, the body, the mind, the intellect and the  soul [1]. Ayurveda dates back to the period of the Indus Valley civilization  (about 3000 B.C) and has been passed on through generations of oral tradition,  like the other four sacred texts (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and  Atharvanaveda) which were composed between 12(th) and 7(th) century B.C [2, 3].  References to the herbal medicines of Ayurveda are found in all of the other  four Vedas, suggesting that Ayurveda predates the other Vedas by at least  several centuries. It was already in full practice at the time of Buddha (6(th)  century B.C) and had produced two of the greatest physicians of ancient India,  Charaka and Shushrutha who composed the basic texts of their trade, the  Samhitas. By this time, ayurveda had already developed eight different  subspecialties of medical treatment, named Ashtanga, which included surgery,  internal medicine, ENT, pediatrics, toxicology, health and longevity, and  spiritual healing [4]. Ayurvedic medicine was mainly composed of herbal  preparations which were occasionally combined with different levels of other  compounds, as supplements [5]. In the Ayurvedic system, the herbs used for  medicinal purposes are classed as brain tonics or rejuvenators. Among the plants  most often used in Ayurveda are, in the descending order of importance: (a)  Ashwagandha, (b) Brahmi, (c) Jatamansi, (d) Jyotishmati, (e) Mandukparni, (f)  Shankhapushpi, and (g) Vacha. The general appearance of these seven plants is  shown in Fig.1. Their corresponding Latin names, as employed in current  scientific literature, the botanical families that each of them belongs to,  their normal habitats in different areas of the world, as well as the common  synonyms by which they are known, are shown in the Table 1. The scientific  investigations concerning the best known and most scientifically investigated of  these herbs, Ashwagandha will be discussed in detail in this review. Ashwagandha  (Withania somnifera, WS), also commonly known, in different parts of the world,  as Indian ginseng, Winter cherry, Ajagandha, Kanaje Hindi and Samm Al Ferakh, is  a plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is also known in different  linguistic areas in India by its local vernacular names [6]. It grows  prolifically in dry regions of South Asia, Central Asia and Africa, particularly  in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, South Africa, Egypt,  Morocco, Congo and Jordon [7]. In India, it is cultivated, on a commercial  scale, in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and  Rajasthan [6]. In Sanskrit, ashwagandha, the Indian name for WS, means \"odor of  the horse\", probably originating from the odor of its root which resembles that  of a sweaty horse. The name\"somnifera\" in Latin means \"sleep-inducer\" which  probably refers to its extensive use as a remedy against stress from a variety  of daily chores. Some herbalists refer to ashwagandha as Indian ginseng, since  it is used in India, in a way similar to how ginseng is used in traditional  Chinese medicine to treat a large variety of human diseases [8]. Ashwagandha is  a shrub whose various parts (berries, leaves and roots) have been used by  Ayurvedic practitioners as folk remedies, or as aphrodisiacs and diuretics. The  fresh roots are sometimes boiled in milk, in order to leach out undesirable  constituents. The berries are sometimes used as a substitute to coagulate milk  in cheese making. In Ayurveda, the herbal preparation is referred to as a  \"rasayana\", an elixir that works, in a nonspecific, global fashion, to increase  human health and longevity. It is also considered an adaptogen, a nontoxic  medication that normalizes physiological functions, disturbed by chronic stress,  through correction of imbalances in the neuroendocrine and immune systems [9,  10]. The scientific research that has been carried out on Ashwagandha and other  ayurvedic herbal medicines may be classified into three major categories, taking  into consideration the endogenous or exogenous phenomena that are known to cause  physiological disequilibrium leading to the pathological state; (A)  pharmacological and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or  multi-herbal mixtures on specific non-neurological diseases; (B) pharmacological  and therapeutic effects of extracts, purified compounds or multi-herbal mixtures  on neurodegenerative disorders; and (C) biochemical, physiological and genetic  studies on the herbal plants themselves, in order to distinguish between those  originating from different habitats, or to improve the known medicinal quality  of the indigenous plant.

The  present newfangled care in clinical research is to determine and to pick a new  track for better treatment options for RA. Recent ethnopharmacological  investigations revealed that traditional herbal remedies are the most preferred  modality of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, several  ayurvedic modes of treatments and formulations for RA are not much studied and  documented from Indian traditional system of medicine. Therefore, this directed  us to develop an integrated database, RAACFDb (acronym: Rheumatoid Arthritis  Ayurvedic Classical Formulations Database) by consolidating data from the  repository of Vedic Samhita - The Ayurveda to retrieve the available  formulations information easily.

Are there any natural alternatives, like herbs, that could help balance my hormones?\nAsparagus racemosus Willd. (Asparagaceae) is an important medicinal plant of  tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the  Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as  Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Asparagus racemosus is mainly known for its  phytoestrogenic properties. With an increasing realization that hormone  replacement therapy with synthetic oestrogens is neither as safe nor as  effective as previously envisaged, the interest in plant-derived oestrogens has  increased tremendously making Asparagus racemosus particularly important. The  plant has been shown to aid in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and  in alcohol abstinence-induced withdrawal symptoms. In Ayurveda, Asparagus  racemosus has been described as a rasayana herb and has been used extensively as  an adaptogen to increase the non-specific resistance of organisms against a  variety of stresses. Besides use in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery,  the plant also has potent antioxidant, immunostimulant, anti-dyspepsia and  antitussive effects. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus  racemosus is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and  inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction in the  form of deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered  'endangered' in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of  this plant is crucial. This article aims to evaluate the biological activities,  pharmacological applications and clinical studies of Asparagus racemosus in an  attempt to provide a direction for further research. Keeping in mind the fact  that it is the active principle that imparts medicinal value to a plant;  consistency in quality and quantity needs to be maintained to ensure uniform  drug efficacy. Also, deliberate or inadvertent adulteration needs to be dealt  with at an early stage. To overcome these prevalent problems, the availability  of genetically superior and uniform planting material is essential. This can be  obtained by a combination of various biotechnological tools involving  chemoprofiling, tissue culture and use of molecular markers. Along with the  application of these methods, proper agro-techniques and adequate marketing  opportunities would encourage cultivation of Asparagus racemosus and thereby  contribute to its conservation. There are also several gaps in the existing  literature with regard to the pharmacological actions of Asparagus racemosus.  These include an incomplete understanding about the interaction/synergy between  Asparagus racemosus and other plant constituents in polyherbal formulations;  lack of information regarding the mode of action of the various constituents of  Asparagus racemosus, etc. Consequently, we have suggested a 'systems biology'  approach that includes metabolite profiling, metabolic fingerprinting,  metabolite target analysis and metabonomics to enable further research."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Asparagus racemosus--ethnopharmacological evaluation and conservation needs', Asparagus racemosus is a plant that can be used in many ways to help with health issues.

It has been used as a \"Rasayana\" (rejuvenator),  nootropic, and as a powerful natural adaptogen. The herb extract is extensively  used for general wellbeing and in specific ailments. However, only a few studies  have investigated the safety and tolerability of Ashwagandha in humans. This  study evaluated the safety of Ashwagandha root extract consumption in healthy  adults. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and  parallel-group study, 80 healthy participants (40 males, 40 females) were  randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ashwagandha 300 mg or a placebo of  the same dosage, twice daily, orally for 8 weeks. The study was conducted at MV  Hospital, and King George Medical University, Lucknow, India. The primary safety  outcomes considered were laboratory assessment of hematological parameters,  serum biochemistry analysis including hepatotoxicity evaluation, and thyroid  function parameters. The secondary outcomes of this study were the clinical  adverse events and the vital parameters. The within and between the groups'  datasets were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann Whitney  U test, respectively. RESULTS: A detailed evaluation of the vital signs such as body weight, body  temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood  pressure, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were conducted for each participant at the  baseline and the end of the study for treatment and placebo groups. Similarly,  hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the baseline and at  the end of study. The outcome did not indicate any untoward effects in any of  the treated volunteers. No statistically significant change or abnormality was  observed in the considered parameters including thyroid hormonal profile in both  the groups. No adverse events were reported by any of the participants in this  study. CONCLUSIONS: Ashwagandha is being consumed since time immemorial following the  Ayurvedic medicine practices. Modern science requires evidence of the safety and  efficacy of the Ashwagandha extract before mass consumption for various health  issues and as a supplement.

The present paper endeavors to provide  for the first time a type of mapping of ayurvedic ethnopharmacological space by  the integration of medicinal plant taste-activity relationship (TA) data,  originating from several traditional sources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present TA database included 183 ayurvedic medicinal  plants, with their traditional description of taste and ethnophamacological  actions (EPA). 111 plants had a unique taste, and 72 plants a combination of  several tastes, consisting of one principal taste, and other 2-4 secondary  tastes. 121 ethnopharmacological actions were considered. Potential global or  individual associations between rasa and karman were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant global correspondence between the  predominant plant taste and the ethnopharmacological activities (Chi-square  test, p<0.05), and the following individual associations (Fisher exact test,  p<0.05, positive association if lnOR >0, negative association if lnOR <0):  bitter- 11 positive associations (lnOR 0.940 to 3.544) and 8 negative  associations (lnOR -0.997 to -3.101), sweet- 14 positive associations (lnOR  0.839 to 3.132) and 20 negative associations (lnOR -0.962 to -3.270), pungent-  23 positive associations (lnOR 0.835 to 4.126) and 11 negative associations  (lnOR -1.255 to -3.147), astringent- 7 positive associations (lnOR 1.099 to  3.813) and 7 negative associations (lnOR -1.076 to -2.631), sour- 7 positive  associations (lnOR 1.128 to 4.664) and 1 negative association (lnOR -2.244).

Ayurveda's tridosha theory identifies principles of motion (vata), metabolism  (pitta), and structure (kapha) as discrete phenotypic groupings. Patwardhan et  al.

Our aim was to prospectively study in a large maternal and  child unit sex-ratio against previous birth sex and use of traditional medicines  for sex selection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sex-ratio among mothers in families with a previous girl  and in those with a previous boy, prevalence of indigenous medicine use and  sex-ratio in those using medicines for sex selection. RESULTS: Overall there were 806 girls to 1000 boys. The sex-ratio was 720:1000  if there was one previous girl and 178:1000 if there were two previous girls.

Is there anything natural I can use to help with this?\nBACKGROUND: Presbycusis is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both  ears at high frequencies, which affects more than half of the older adults by  the age of 75 years and is often accompanied by tinnitus and cognitive  deterioration. Unfortunately, there are no treatments available to restore  hearing loss. Treatment mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and  communication with hearing aids. Traditional medicine like Ayurveda also  explains ailments of a similar nature as Badhirya and advises using drugs with  antiaging and neuroprotective activity for treatment. In Ayurveda, Badhirya and  Karnanada (senile deafness with tinnitus) are due to vitiation of Vata Dosha.  Treatments such as topical oil pooling (Karnapurana) are usually advised to  counter Vata, improve hearing capacity, and reduce tinnitus. Kshirabala Taila, a  medicated oil formulation prepared with Sida cordifolia Linnaeus, is one of the  most preferred oils for topical oil pooling in such conditions, as it has a  definitive indication for sensory dysfunctions. Drugs like Withania somnifera  (L.) Dunal (Ashwagandha) are also used, as they ameliorate neurodegeneration and  help to improve cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: We propose an exploratory randomized controlled trial study for  evaluating the efficacy of TOPMAC (Topical Oil Pooling with Kshirabala Taila and  Supplementation of Ashwagandha Churna) in tinnitus suppression and hearing and  cognitive function protection in patients aged 60-75 years with mild to moderate  presbycusis. METHODS: A parallel, 2-group, exploratory randomized controlled trial will be  conducted in an Indian Ayurvedic research center at its outpatient service.  Participants (N=60) with mild to moderate presbycusis will be recruited by  screening. Participants will be randomized (computer-generated 1:1) to receive  either basic treatment and health education (BTHE) or BTHE+TOPMAC for 24 weeks.  The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in  the protection of hearing function. The secondary objective is to compare the  efficacy of TOPMAC with that of BTHE in tinnitus suppression and cognitive  function protection. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2023. The institutional ethics  committees at National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma  (3/1/2020/NARIP/Tech/2036) and Institute for Communicative and Cognitive Neuro  Sciences (IEC006) approved this study. The first patient was enrolled in  September 2023; 22 participants were enrolled as of August 2024. The data  analysis is yet to start, and the results are expected to be published by  January 2025.

Ayurvedic  practitioners of Asian origin and those who practiced for a longer duration were  more likely to report that they treated oral diseases. Larger, population-based  studies are needed to understand more fully the current role of Ayurvedic  practitioners in oral health care. Ayurvedic treatment modalities aimed at oral  diseases need to be evaluated through rigorous randomized controlled trials for  safety and effectiveness. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients with limited or no access to oral health care  might seek Ayurvedic treatment, and those who have access to conventional oral  health care might wish to complement it with Ayurvedic treatment.

According to this system an individual's  basic constitution to a large extent determines predisposition and prognosis to  diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime. Ayurveda describes seven  broad constitution types (Prakritis) each with a varying degree of  predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting  types, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of  modern predictive medicine, efforts are being directed towards capturing disease  phenotypes with greater precision for successful identification of markers for  prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the different  constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates. METHODS: Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types  were identified following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian  population of Indo-European origin. The peripheral blood samples of these  individuals were analysed for genome wide expression levels, biochemical and  hematological parameters. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway based analysis was  carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were  significant enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types. RESULTS: Individuals from the three most contrasting constitutional types  exhibit striking differences with respect to biochemical and hematological  parameters and at genome wide expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver  function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological parameters like haemoglobin  exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of genes  showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched  in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent  protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation. A  significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were  observed in these extreme constitution types. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme  constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system  level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease  predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical  phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern  biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise  for future predictive medicine."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Whole genome expression and biochemical correlates of extreme constitutional types defined in Ayurveda', Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medical practice that believes our body type can determine our health and the kind of diseases we may get.

Could there be a natural, holistic approach to help me feel better overall?\nThis paper focuses on the worldview hypotheses and research design approaches  from nonlinear dynamical complex systems (NDS) science that can inform future  studies of whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WS-CAM),  e.g., Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and homeopathy. The worldview  hypotheses that underlie NDS and WS-CAM (contextual, organismic,  interactive-integrative - Pepper, 1942) overlap with each other, but differ  fundamentally from those of biomedicine (formistic, mechanistic). Differing  views on the nature of causality itself lead to different types of study  designs. Biomedical efficacy studies assume a simple direct mechanistic  cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily  outcome, an assumption less relevant to WS-CAM outcomes. WS-CAM practitioners do  not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Rather, they intervene to modulate an  intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and to create a more  favorable environmental context for the emergence of health, e.g., with dietary  changes compatible with the constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system  thereby fosters the emergence of indirect, diffuse, complex effects throughout  the person and the person's interactions with his/her environment. NDS  theory-driven study designs thus have the potential for greater external and  model validity than biomedically driven efficacy studies (e.g., clinical trials)  for evaluating the indirect effects of WS-CAM practices. Potential applications  of NDS analytic techniques to WS-CAM include characterizing different  constitutional types and documenting the evolution and dynamics of whole-person  healing and well-being over time.

METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide  Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of  Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India.  1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional  herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)  and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in  treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of  tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in  powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30  min post-meals.

Although several studies have reported  beneficial effects of these formulations on different components of life  history, few have investigated their concurrent influence on various  life-history traits. Here, we report the results of an investigation showing the  effect of two well-known Ayurvedic formulations, Guduchi and Madhuyashti, on  fecundity and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were either grown  (i.e., larval exposure) and/or maintained (i.e., adult exposure) on standard  food supplemented with 0.5% Guduchi or 0.5% Madhuyashti.

The  paper begins by illustrating the historical continuity of this process by way of  an example from India's colonial era. The fact that specific practices or  materials are regarded as biomedically useful because they 'work' (are  efficacious) does not mean that the 'traditional' theories underlying them are  seen as correct. The knowledge contained in these traditions is not counted as  legitimate, as the emphasis in biomedicine (the legitimate canon) on an  identifiable concrete location in the body for the source of health problems  creates difficulties-both for patients when their problems are not provided with  a cause that matches their subjective awareness, and for the practitioners of  other traditions whose patients have been exposed to biomedicine. The paper goes  on to demonstrate, using case examples from extended ethnographic fieldwork in  southern India, how this is played out in a setting in which an educated Indian  patient population accepts this form of knowledge as legitimate but espouses  ayurvedic therapy. Notions of 'evidence' are shown to be central to the  interplay between biomedical and other medical traditions, since objective tests  and measures in biomedicine are accepted as the only legitimate 'evidence' of  cure, but these do not necessarily accord either with the premises of these  other traditions or with patients' subjective perceptions of well-being.

Are there any traditional or alternative methods that might help alongside my regular treatment?\nOBJECTIVES: While the introduction of biomedicine within the Sri Lankan  healthcare system has resulted in reduced reliance on traditional, complementary  and alternative medicine (TCAM) over the last century in Sri Lanka, treatment  modalities such as Ayurveda, Sinhala and traditional religious practices still  receive considerable public support. Cancer is an increasing burden in Sri  Lanka, and whilst Sri Lankans are known to use TCAM for everyday ailments, there  has been no research examining the role of TCAM in the context of cancer. The  aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of TCAM use by  cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was initiated with an aim to inventorize the  ayurvedic medicinal plant recourses and explore the traditional knowledge of  tribal people of Kakrajhore forest to treat several diseases along with the  sustainable management and conservation of medicinal plants. METHODS: The information on the medicinal plant resources were gathered through  floristic inventorization with proper sampling method in the study area  (N22\u00b042'57.05\u2033, E86\u00b034'58.02\u2033) during the year 2015. For floristic  inventorization the study area of 312 ha was delineated by using GPS Receiver.  Then total mapped area was divided by virtual grid of 100m apart in both  East-West and North-South direction to allocate 60 sample plots by random  sampling. In addition to inventorization, the use value (UV) of the species was  determined and the informant consensus factor (ICF) was calculated for the  medicinal plants found in the study area based on personal interview. Further  exploration was carried out to establish linkage with Ayurveda. RESULTS: The present survey has identified 57 numbers of ethno-medicinal plants  belonging to 39 families, used for preparing medicinal remedies. The habit of  the plants includes 35% trees, 28% shrubs, 23% herbs and 14% climbers. The most  frequently utilized plant parts were the Roots & Tuber roots (26%), Stem which  includes Bark, Tubers, Bulb, Rhizome, Gum, Wood & Young shoots (24%), Leaves  (18%), Fruits (13%), and Seeds (10%). The most frequent happening ailments are  asthma and bronchitis, constipation and dyspepsia, diarrhea, dysentery, ulcer,  rheumatism, arthritis, fistula and piles troubles.

Ayurveda,  Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems.  These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet,  herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as  non-drug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and  by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India,  particularly in rural India, where 70% of the population lives.

AIM OF THE REVIEW: We present a critical overview of the information on the  metabolomics of W. somnifera and highlight the significance of the technique for  use in quality control of medicinal products. We have also pointed out the use  of metabolomics to distinguish varieties and to identify best methods of  cultivation, collection, as well as extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relevant information on medicinal value, phytochemical  studies, metabolomics of W. somnifera, and their applications were collected  from a rigorous electronic search through scientific databases, including  Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Structures of selected  metabolites were from the PubChem. RESULTS: The pharmacological activities of W. somnifera were well documented.  Roots are the most important parts of the plant used in Ayurvedic preparations.  Stem and leaves also have a rich content of bioactive phytochemicals like  steroidal lactones, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. Metabolomic studies revealed  that metabolite profiles of W. somnifera depended on plant parts collected and  the developmental stage of the plant, besides the season of sample collection  and geographical location. The levels of withanolides were variable, depending  on the morpho/chemotypes within the species of W. somnifera. Although studies on  W. somnifera were initiated several years ago, the complexity of secondary  metabolites was not realized due to the lack of adequate and fool-proof  technology for phytochemical fingerprinting. Sophistications in chromatography  coupled to mass spectrometry facilitated the discovery of several new  metabolites. Mutually complementary techniques like LC-MS, GC-MS, HPTLC, and NMR  were employed to obtain a comprehensive metabolomic profile. Subsequent data  analyses and searches against spectral databases enabled the annotation of  signals and dereplication of metabolites in several numbers without isolating  them individually. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides a critical update of metabolomic data  and the diverse application of the technique. The identification of parameters  for standardization and quality control of herbal products is essential to  facilitate mandatory checks for the purity of formulation. Such studies would  enable us to identify the best geographical location of plants and the time of  collection. We recommend the use of metabolomic analysis of herbal products  based on W. somnifera for quality control as well as the discovery of novel  bioactive compounds."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to 'Metabolomics of Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal: Advances and applications', Ashwagandha, also known as Indian ginseng, is a plant used in traditional Indian medicine for boosting energy, protecting the heart, and treating a range of other health issues. The most useful parts of the plant are its roots, but the stem and leaves also contain healthy natural chemicals. The amount of these helpful substances in the plant can change depending on where and when the plant is grown and harvested. The researchers suggest using a technique called metabolomics to check the quality of Ashwagandha-based products and to find out the best ways to grow and use the plant."}]}

METHOD: 521 consecutive patients visiting the Hypertension Clinic at the  Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India,  over a 6-month period were interviewed. Information was gathered on the  patients' demographics, type(s) of CAM used, sequence of seeking CAM and  conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons for opting for CAM and  areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM.  Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: It was observed that 63.9% of patients overall used CAM. Ayurveda was  the most commonly used CAM (56.7%), followed by herbal medicines (14.4%). The  most commonly cited reason by patients for using CAM was fear of adverse drug  reactions of conventional medicines (59.0%). However, more than half of the  patients eventually became dissatisfied using CAM. Only 5.4% of CAM users had  informed their medical doctors about the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients receiving conventional  treatment for hypertension also use CAM therapies.

Materials and Methods: A complex oral  and proctocolonic Ayurvedic multiherbal medication was administered daily for 1  month to inpatients. Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral  medication for additional 5 months. Four renal function tests (RFTs) were  evaluated at various time points (TPs): (1) 6 months before baseline (TP -6),  (2) at baseline (TP 0), and (3) after completion of 6 months of treatment (TP  +6). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse-Geisser  correction and Friedman's ANOVA by ranks were used to analyze the RFTs. For post  hoc tests, the Bonferroni correction was applied. Bias-corrected effect sizes  (Hedges) for the treatment were calculated. Results: Sixty-four nondialysis CRF  patients with laboratory investigations of the preceding 6 months were included;  12 patients discontinued the treatment. Fifty-two patients with stage IV or V at  baseline completed the study. Mean concentrations of estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and hemoglobin differed significantly  between TPs (eGFR: F\u2009=\u200915.3, p\u2009<\u20090.001; serum creatinine: F\u2009=\u200929.3, p\u2009<\u20090.001;  blood urea: F\u2009=\u20092.0, p\u2009=\u20090.159; hemoglobin: F\u2009=\u200953.9, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Pairwise  comparisons of the mean differences between TPs are significant for eGFR,  creatinine, and hemoglobin. For blood urea, a significant decrease was observed  for the treatment period [15.9(\u2193) mg/dL, standard error 4.0; n\u2009=\u200952], but a  nonsignificant increase was observed for the pretreatment period [16.2(\u2191) mg/dL,  standard error 9.8] due to insufficient data for TP -6 (n\u2009=\u200926).

Khasi indigenous healers describe themselves  as doktor sla, plant doctors, to distinguish themselves from doktor kot, or book  doctors. This distinction operates as a rhetorical resource, utilised to carve a  distinct sphere of expertise in relation to the allopathic sector, and to mark  claims for the specifically local appropriateness of traditional practices  within a shifting market of state-sponsored provision.

In  addition to claiming these discrete strengths, healers also present themselves  as accommodating deficiencies in biomedicine, including inherent generic  weaknesses of allopathic care as well as specific local gaps in rural health  care provision. Thus, the expertise niches of traditional healers have evolved  through their interactions with, and the needs of, the community, but also  through managing a shifting boundary with biomedical practitioners, who are  explicitly sceptical of their efficacy, but tacitly accepting of the ways in  which they manage the gaps in biomedical provision.

DESIGN: Systematic review of trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a  system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic  treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles  in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching  journals in India were examined, yielding 54 articles reporting the results of  62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and  Eugenia jambolana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush-82 and  D-400 were most often studied.
